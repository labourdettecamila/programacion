12662,12663,Alls well that ends well,9.0,,KING EDWARD IV,"Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black"
12663,12664,Alls well that ends well,1.0,1.1.1,COUNTESS,"In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband."
12664,12665,Alls well that ends well,2.0,1.1.2,BERTRAM,"And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death"
12665,12666,Alls well that ends well,2.0,1.1.3,BERTRAM,"anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to"
12666,12667,Alls well that ends well,2.0,1.1.4,BERTRAM,"whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection."
12667,12668,Alls well that ends well,3.0,1.1.5,LAFEU,"You shall find of the king a husband, madam, you,"
12668,12669,Alls well that ends well,3.0,1.1.6,LAFEU,"sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times"
12669,12670,Alls well that ends well,3.0,1.1.7,LAFEU,"good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose"
12670,12671,Alls well that ends well,3.0,1.1.8,LAFEU,worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
12671,12672,Alls well that ends well,3.0,1.1.9,LAFEU,than lack it where there is such abundance.
12672,12673,Alls well that ends well,4.0,1.1.10,COUNTESS,What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
12673,12674,Alls well that ends well,5.0,1.1.11,LAFEU,"He hath abandoned his physicians, madam, under whose"
12674,12675,Alls well that ends well,5.0,1.1.12,LAFEU,"practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and"
12675,12676,Alls well that ends well,5.0,1.1.13,LAFEU,finds no other advantage in the process but only the
12676,12677,Alls well that ends well,5.0,1.1.14,LAFEU,losing of hope by time.
12677,12678,Alls well that ends well,6.0,1.1.15,COUNTESS,"This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that"
12678,12679,Alls well that ends well,6.0,1.1.16,COUNTESS,'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
12679,12680,Alls well that ends well,6.0,1.1.17,COUNTESS,"almost as great as his honesty, had it stretched so"
12680,12681,Alls well that ends well,6.0,1.1.18,COUNTESS,"far, would have made nature immortal, and death"
12681,12682,Alls well that ends well,6.0,1.1.19,COUNTESS,"should have play for lack of work. Would, for the"
12682,12683,Alls well that ends well,6.0,1.1.20,COUNTESS,"king's sake, he were living! I think it would be"
12683,12684,Alls well that ends well,6.0,1.1.21,COUNTESS,the death of the king's disease.
12684,12685,Alls well that ends well,7.0,1.1.22,LAFEU,"How called you the man you speak of, madam?"
12685,12686,Alls well that ends well,8.0,1.1.23,COUNTESS,"He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was"
12686,12687,Alls well that ends well,8.0,1.1.24,COUNTESS,his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
12687,12688,Alls well that ends well,9.0,1.1.25,LAFEU,"He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very"
12688,12689,Alls well that ends well,9.0,1.1.26,LAFEU,lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
12689,12690,Alls well that ends well,9.0,1.1.27,LAFEU,"was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge"
12690,12691,Alls well that ends well,9.0,1.1.28,LAFEU,could be set up against mortality.
12691,12692,Alls well that ends well,10.0,1.1.29,BERTRAM,"What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?"
12692,12693,Alls well that ends well,11.0,1.1.30,LAFEU,"A fistula, my lord."
12693,12694,Alls well that ends well,12.0,1.1.31,BERTRAM,I heard not of it before.
12694,12695,Alls well that ends well,13.0,1.1.32,LAFEU,I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
12695,12696,Alls well that ends well,13.0,1.1.33,LAFEU,the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
12696,12697,Alls well that ends well,14.0,1.1.34,COUNTESS,"His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my"

12701,12702,Alls well that ends well,14.0,1.1.39,COUNTESS,"commendations go with pity, they are virtues and"
12702,12703,Alls well that ends well,14.0,1.1.40,COUNTESS,"traitors too, in her they are the better for their"

12704,12705,Alls well that ends well,15.0,1.1.42,LAFEU,"Your commendations, madam, get from her tears."
12705,12706,Alls well that ends well,16.0,1.1.43,COUNTESS,'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
12706,12707,Alls well that ends well,16.0,1.1.44,COUNTESS,in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
12707,12708,Alls well that ends well,16.0,1.1.45,COUNTESS,her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
12708,12709,Alls well that ends well,16.0,1.1.46,COUNTESS,"livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena,"
12709,12710,Alls well that ends well,16.0,1.1.47,COUNTESS,"go to, no more, lest it be rather thought you affect"
12710,12711,Alls well that ends well,16.0,1.1.48,COUNTESS,a sorrow than have it.
12711,12712,Alls well that ends well,17.0,1.1.49,HELENA,"I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too."
12712,12713,Alls well that ends well,18.0,1.1.50,LAFEU,"Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,"
12713,12714,Alls well that ends well,18.0,1.1.51,LAFEU,excessive grief the enemy to the living.

12715,12716,Alls well that ends well,19.0,1.1.53,COUNTESS,makes it soon mortal.
12716,12717,Alls well that ends well,20.0,1.1.54,BERTRAM,"Madam, I desire your holy wishes."
12717,12718,Alls well that ends well,21.0,1.1.55,LAFEU,How understand we that?
12718,12719,Alls well that ends well,22.0,1.1.56,COUNTESS,"Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father"

12724,12725,Alls well that ends well,22.0,1.1.62,COUNTESS,"Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,"
12725,12726,Alls well that ends well,22.0,1.1.63,COUNTESS,"But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,"
12726,12727,Alls well that ends well,22.0,1.1.64,COUNTESS,"That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,"
12727,12728,Alls well that ends well,22.0,1.1.65,COUNTESS,"Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord,"
12728,12729,Alls well that ends well,22.0,1.1.66,COUNTESS,"'Tis an unseason'd courtier, good my lord,"
12729,12730,Alls well that ends well,22.0,1.1.67,COUNTESS,Advise him.
12730,12731,Alls well that ends well,23.0,1.1.68,LAFEU,He cannot want the best

12736,12737,Alls well that ends well,25.0,1.1.73,BERTRAM,"to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her."
12737,12738,Alls well that ends well,26.0,1.1.74,LAFEU,"Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of"
12738,12739,Alls well that ends well,26.0,1.1.75,LAFEU,your father.
12739,12740,Alls well that ends well,26.0,,LAFEU,Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
12740,12741,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.76,HELENA,"O, were that all! I think not on my father,"
12741,12742,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.77,HELENA,And these great tears grace his remembrance more
12742,12743,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.78,HELENA,Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
12743,12744,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.79,HELENA,I have forgot him: my imagination
12744,12745,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.80,HELENA,Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
12745,12746,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.81,HELENA,"I am undone: there is no living, none,"
12746,12747,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.82,HELENA,If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
12747,12748,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.83,HELENA,That I should love a bright particular star
12748,12749,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.84,HELENA,"And think to wed it, he is so above me:"
12749,12750,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.85,HELENA,In his bright radiance and collateral light
12750,12751,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.86,HELENA,"Must I be comforted, not in his sphere."
12751,12752,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.87,HELENA,The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
12752,12753,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.88,HELENA,The hind that would be mated by the lion
12753,12754,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.89,HELENA,"Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,"
12754,12755,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.90,HELENA,"To see him every hour, to sit and draw"
12755,12756,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.91,HELENA,"His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,"
12756,12757,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.92,HELENA,"In our heart's table, heart too capable"
12757,12758,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.93,HELENA,Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
12758,12759,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.94,HELENA,"But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy"
12759,12760,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.95,HELENA,Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
12760,12761,Alls well that ends well,27.0,,HELENA,Enter PAROLLES
12761,12762,Alls well that ends well,27.0,,HELENA,Aside
12762,12763,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.96,HELENA,"One that goes with him: I love him for his sake,"
12763,12764,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.97,HELENA,"And yet I know him a notorious liar,"
12764,12765,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.98,HELENA,"Think him a great way fool, solely a coward,"
12765,12766,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.99,HELENA,"Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,"
12766,12767,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.100,HELENA,"That they take place, when virtue's steely bones"
12767,12768,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.101,HELENA,"Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see"
12768,12769,Alls well that ends well,27.0,1.1.102,HELENA,Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
12769,12770,Alls well that ends well,28.0,1.1.103,PAROLLES,"Save you, fair queen!"
12770,12771,Alls well that ends well,29.0,1.1.104,HELENA,"And you, monarch!"
12771,12772,Alls well that ends well,30.0,1.1.105,PAROLLES,No.
12772,12773,Alls well that ends well,31.0,1.1.106,HELENA,And no.
12773,12774,Alls well that ends well,32.0,1.1.107,PAROLLES,Are you meditating on virginity?
12774,12775,Alls well that ends well,33.0,1.1.108,HELENA,Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
12775,12776,Alls well that ends well,33.0,1.1.109,HELENA,"ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity, how"
12776,12777,Alls well that ends well,33.0,1.1.110,HELENA,may we barricado it against him?
12777,12778,Alls well that ends well,34.0,1.1.111,PAROLLES,Keep him out.
12778,12779,Alls well that ends well,35.0,1.1.112,HELENA,"But he assails, and our virginity, though valiant,"
12779,12780,Alls well that ends well,35.0,1.1.113,HELENA,in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
12780,12781,Alls well that ends well,35.0,1.1.114,HELENA,warlike resistance.
12781,12782,Alls well that ends well,36.0,1.1.115,PAROLLES,"There is none: man, sitting down before you, will"
12782,12783,Alls well that ends well,36.0,1.1.116,PAROLLES,undermine you and blow you up.
12783,12784,Alls well that ends well,37.0,1.1.117,HELENA,Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
12784,12785,Alls well that ends well,37.0,1.1.118,HELENA,"blowers up! Is there no military policy, how"
12785,12786,Alls well that ends well,37.0,1.1.119,HELENA,virgins might blow up men?
12786,12787,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.120,PAROLLES,"Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be"
12787,12788,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.121,PAROLLES,"blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with"
12788,12789,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.122,PAROLLES,"the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It"
12789,12790,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.123,PAROLLES,is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
12790,12791,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.124,PAROLLES,preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
12791,12792,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.125,PAROLLES,increase and there was never virgin got till
12792,12793,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.126,PAROLLES,virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
12793,12794,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.127,PAROLLES,metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
12794,12795,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.128,PAROLLES,"may be ten times found, by being ever kept, it is"
12795,12796,Alls well that ends well,38.0,1.1.129,PAROLLES,"ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion, away with 't!"
12796,12797,Alls well that ends well,39.0,1.1.130,HELENA,"I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin."
12797,12798,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.131,PAROLLES,"There's little can be said in 't, 'tis against the"
12798,12799,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.132,PAROLLES,"rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,"
12799,12800,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.133,PAROLLES,"is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible"
12800,12801,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.134,PAROLLES,disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
12801,12802,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.135,PAROLLES,virginity murders itself and should be buried in
12802,12803,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.136,PAROLLES,"highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate"
12803,12804,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.137,PAROLLES,"offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,"
12804,12805,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.138,PAROLLES,"much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very"
12805,12806,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.139,PAROLLES,"paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach."
12806,12807,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.140,PAROLLES,"Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of"
12807,12808,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.141,PAROLLES,"self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the"
12808,12809,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.142,PAROLLES,"canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but loose"
12809,12810,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.143,PAROLLES,by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
12810,12811,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.144,PAROLLES,"itself ten, which is a goodly increase, and the"
12811,12812,Alls well that ends well,40.0,1.1.145,PAROLLES,principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
12812,12813,Alls well that ends well,41.0,1.1.146,HELENA,"How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?"
12813,12814,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.147,PAROLLES,"Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it"
12814,12815,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.148,PAROLLES,likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
12815,12816,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.149,PAROLLES,"lying, the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't"
12816,12817,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.150,PAROLLES,"while 'tis vendible, answer the time of request."
12817,12818,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.151,PAROLLES,"Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out"
12818,12819,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.152,PAROLLES,"of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just"
12819,12820,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.153,PAROLLES,"like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not"
12820,12821,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.154,PAROLLES,now. Your date is better in your pie and your
12821,12822,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.155,PAROLLES,"porridge than in your cheek, and your virginity,"
12822,12823,Alls well that ends well,42.0,1.1.156,PAROLLES,"your old virginity, is like one of our French"

13407,13408,Alls well that ends well,50.0,2.1.146,HELENA,Oft does them by the weakest minister:

13418,13419,Alls well that ends well,52.0,2.1.157,HELENA,Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:

13691,13692,Alls well that ends well,57.0,2.3.134,KING,It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
13692,13693,Alls well that ends well,57.0,2.3.135,KING,Is good without a name. Vileness is so:

14444,14445,Alls well that ends well,15.0,3.6.47,First Lord,That was not to be blamed in the command of the

14537,14538,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.22,HELENA,"Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,"
14538,14539,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.23,HELENA,As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
14539,14540,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.24,HELENA,Now his important blood will nought deny
14540,14541,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.25,HELENA,"That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,"
14541,14542,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.26,HELENA,That downward hath succeeded in his house
14542,14543,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.27,HELENA,"From son to son, some four or five descents"
14543,14544,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.28,HELENA,Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
14544,14545,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.29,HELENA,"In most rich choice, yet in his idle fire,"
14545,14546,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.30,HELENA,"To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,"
14546,14547,Alls well that ends well,5.0,3.7.31,HELENA,Howe'er repented after.
14547,14548,Alls well that ends well,6.0,3.7.32,Widow,Now I see
14548,14549,Alls well that ends well,6.0,3.7.33,Widow,The bottom of your purpose.
14549,14550,Alls well that ends well,7.0,3.7.34,HELENA,"You see it lawful, then: it is no more,"
14550,14551,Alls well that ends well,7.0,3.7.35,HELENA,"But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,"
14551,14552,Alls well that ends well,7.0,3.7.36,HELENA,"Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter,"
14552,14553,Alls well that ends well,7.0,3.7.37,HELENA,"In fine, delivers me to fill the time,"
14553,14554,Alls well that ends well,7.0,3.7.38,HELENA,"Herself most chastely absent: after this,"
14554,14555,Alls well that ends well,7.0,3.7.39,HELENA,"To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns"
14555,14556,Alls well that ends well,7.0,3.7.40,HELENA,To what is passed already.
14556,14557,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.41,Widow,I have yielded:
14557,14558,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.42,Widow,"Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,"
14558,14559,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.43,Widow,That time and place with this deceit so lawful
14559,14560,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.44,Widow,May prove coherent. Every night he comes
14560,14561,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.45,Widow,With musics of all sorts and songs composed
14561,14562,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.46,Widow,To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
14562,14563,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.47,Widow,"To chide him from our eaves, for he persists"
14563,14564,Alls well that ends well,8.0,3.7.48,Widow,As if his life lay on't.
14564,14565,Alls well that ends well,9.0,3.7.49,HELENA,Why then to-night
14565,14566,Alls well that ends well,9.0,3.7.50,HELENA,"Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,"
14566,14567,Alls well that ends well,9.0,3.7.51,HELENA,Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
14567,14568,Alls well that ends well,9.0,3.7.52,HELENA,"And lawful meaning in a lawful act,"
14568,14569,Alls well that ends well,9.0,3.7.53,HELENA,"Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:"
14569,14570,Alls well that ends well,9.0,3.7.54,HELENA,But let's about it.
14570,14571,Alls well that ends well,9.0,,HELENA,Exeunt
14571,14572,Alls well that ends well,9.0,,HELENA,ACT IV
14572,14573,Alls well that ends well,9.0,,HELENA,SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.
14573,14574,Alls well that ends well,9.0,,HELENA,"Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush"
14574,14575,Alls well that ends well,1.0,4.1.1,Second Lord,He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
14575,14576,Alls well that ends well,1.0,4.1.2,Second Lord,"When you sally upon him, speak what terrible"
14576,14577,Alls well that ends well,1.0,4.1.3,Second Lord,language you will: though you understand it not
14577,14578,Alls well that ends well,1.0,4.1.4,Second Lord,"yourselves, no matter, for we must not seem to"
14578,14579,Alls well that ends well,1.0,4.1.5,Second Lord,"understand him, unless some one among us whom we"
14579,14580,Alls well that ends well,1.0,4.1.6,Second Lord,must produce for an interpreter.
14580,14581,Alls well that ends well,2.0,4.1.7,First Soldier,"Good captain, let me be the interpreter."
14581,14582,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.1.8,Second Lord,Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
14582,14583,Alls well that ends well,4.0,4.1.9,First Soldier,"No, sir, I warrant you."
14583,14584,Alls well that ends well,5.0,4.1.10,Second Lord,But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
14584,14585,Alls well that ends well,6.0,4.1.11,First Soldier,E'en such as you speak to me.
14585,14586,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.12,Second Lord,He must think us some band of strangers i' the
14586,14587,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.13,Second Lord,adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
14587,14588,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.14,Second Lord,"all neighbouring languages, therefore we must every"
14588,14589,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.15,Second Lord,"one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we"
14589,14590,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.16,Second Lord,"speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to"
14590,14591,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.17,Second Lord,"know straight our purpose: choughs' language,"
14591,14592,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.18,Second Lord,"gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,"
14592,14593,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.19,Second Lord,"interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,"
14593,14594,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.20,Second Lord,"ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,"
14594,14595,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.1.21,Second Lord,and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
14595,14596,Alls well that ends well,7.0,,Second Lord,Enter PAROLLES
14596,14597,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.22,PAROLLES,Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
14597,14598,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.23,PAROLLES,time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
14598,14599,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.24,PAROLLES,done? It must be a very plausive invention that
14599,14600,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.25,PAROLLES,"carries it: they begin to smoke me, and disgraces"
14600,14601,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.26,PAROLLES,have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
14601,14602,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.27,PAROLLES,"my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the"
14602,14603,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.28,PAROLLES,"fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not"
14603,14604,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.1.29,PAROLLES,daring the reports of my tongue.
14604,14605,Alls well that ends well,9.0,4.1.30,Second Lord,This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
14605,14606,Alls well that ends well,9.0,4.1.31,Second Lord,was guilty of.
14606,14607,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.32,PAROLLES,What the devil should move me to undertake the
14607,14608,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.33,PAROLLES,"recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the"
14608,14609,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.34,PAROLLES,"impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I"
14609,14610,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.35,PAROLLES,"must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in"
14610,14611,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.36,PAROLLES,"exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it, they"
14611,14612,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.37,PAROLLES,"will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great"
14612,14613,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.38,PAROLLES,"ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the"
14613,14614,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.39,PAROLLES,"instance? Tongue, I must put you into a"
14614,14615,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.40,PAROLLES,butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
14615,14616,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.1.41,PAROLLES,"Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils."
14616,14617,Alls well that ends well,11.0,4.1.42,Second Lord,"Is it possible he should know what he is, and be"
14617,14618,Alls well that ends well,11.0,4.1.43,Second Lord,that he is?
14618,14619,Alls well that ends well,12.0,4.1.44,PAROLLES,I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
14619,14620,Alls well that ends well,12.0,4.1.45,PAROLLES,"turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword."
14620,14621,Alls well that ends well,13.0,4.1.46,Second Lord,We cannot afford you so.
14621,14622,Alls well that ends well,14.0,4.1.47,PAROLLES,"Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in"
14622,14623,Alls well that ends well,14.0,4.1.48,PAROLLES,stratagem.
14623,14624,Alls well that ends well,15.0,4.1.49,Second Lord,'Twould not do.
14624,14625,Alls well that ends well,16.0,4.1.50,PAROLLES,"Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped."
14625,14626,Alls well that ends well,17.0,4.1.51,Second Lord,Hardly serve.
14626,14627,Alls well that ends well,18.0,4.1.52,PAROLLES,Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
14627,14628,Alls well that ends well,19.0,4.1.53,Second Lord,How deep?
14628,14629,Alls well that ends well,20.0,4.1.54,PAROLLES,Thirty fathom.
14629,14630,Alls well that ends well,21.0,4.1.55,Second Lord,Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
14630,14631,Alls well that ends well,22.0,4.1.56,PAROLLES,I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
14631,14632,Alls well that ends well,22.0,4.1.57,PAROLLES,I recovered it.
14632,14633,Alls well that ends well,23.0,4.1.58,Second Lord,You shall hear one anon.
14633,14634,Alls well that ends well,24.0,4.1.59,PAROLLES,"A drum now of the enemy's,--"
14634,14635,Alls well that ends well,24.0,,PAROLLES,Alarum within
14635,14636,Alls well that ends well,25.0,4.1.60,Second Lord,"Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo."
14636,14637,Alls well that ends well,26.0,4.1.61,All,"Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo."
14637,14638,Alls well that ends well,27.0,4.1.62,PAROLLES,"O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes."
14638,14639,Alls well that ends well,27.0,,PAROLLES,They seize and blindfold him
14639,14640,Alls well that ends well,28.0,4.1.63,First Soldier,Boskos thromuldo boskos.
14640,14641,Alls well that ends well,29.0,4.1.64,PAROLLES,I know you are the Muskos' regiment:
14641,14642,Alls well that ends well,29.0,4.1.65,PAROLLES,"And I shall lose my life for want of language,"
14642,14643,Alls well that ends well,29.0,4.1.66,PAROLLES,"If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,"
14643,14644,Alls well that ends well,29.0,4.1.67,PAROLLES,"Italian, or French, let him speak to me, I'll"

14645,14646,Alls well that ends well,30.0,4.1.69,First Soldier,"Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak"
14646,14647,Alls well that ends well,30.0,4.1.70,First Soldier,"thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy"
14647,14648,Alls well that ends well,30.0,4.1.71,First Soldier,"faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom."
14648,14649,Alls well that ends well,31.0,4.1.72,PAROLLES,O!

14651,14652,Alls well that ends well,34.0,4.1.75,First Soldier,"The general is content to spare thee yet,"
14652,14653,Alls well that ends well,34.0,4.1.76,First Soldier,"And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on"
14653,14654,Alls well that ends well,34.0,4.1.77,First Soldier,To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
14654,14655,Alls well that ends well,34.0,4.1.78,First Soldier,Something to save thy life.
14655,14656,Alls well that ends well,35.0,4.1.79,PAROLLES,"O, let me live!"
14656,14657,Alls well that ends well,35.0,4.1.80,PAROLLES,"And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,"
14657,14658,Alls well that ends well,35.0,4.1.81,PAROLLES,"Their force, their purposes, nay, I'll speak that"
14658,14659,Alls well that ends well,35.0,4.1.82,PAROLLES,Which you will wonder at.
14659,14660,Alls well that ends well,36.0,4.1.83,First Soldier,But wilt thou faithfully?
14660,14661,Alls well that ends well,37.0,4.1.84,PAROLLES,"If I do not, damn me."
14661,14662,Alls well that ends well,38.0,4.1.85,First Soldier,Acordo linta.
14662,14663,Alls well that ends well,38.0,4.1.86,First Soldier,"Come on, thou art granted space."

14668,14669,Alls well that ends well,41.0,4.1.91,Second Lord,A' will betray us all unto ourselves:

14670,14671,Alls well that ends well,42.0,4.1.93,Second Soldier,"So I will, sir."

14675,14676,Alls well that ends well,1.0,4.2.1,BERTRAM,They told me that your name was Fontibell.

14677,14678,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.3,BERTRAM,"Titled goddess,"
14678,14679,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.4,BERTRAM,"And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,"
14679,14680,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.5,BERTRAM,In your fine frame hath love no quality?
14680,14681,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.6,BERTRAM,"If quick fire of youth light not your mind,"
14681,14682,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.7,BERTRAM,"You are no maiden, but a monument:"
14682,14683,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.8,BERTRAM,"When you are dead, you should be such a one"

14684,14685,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.10,BERTRAM,And now you should be as your mother was
14685,14686,Alls well that ends well,3.0,4.2.11,BERTRAM,When your sweet self was got.
14686,14687,Alls well that ends well,4.0,4.2.12,DIANA,She then was honest.
14687,14688,Alls well that ends well,5.0,4.2.13,BERTRAM,So should you be.
14688,14689,Alls well that ends well,6.0,4.2.14,DIANA,No:
14689,14690,Alls well that ends well,6.0,4.2.15,DIANA,"My mother did but duty, such, my lord,"
14690,14691,Alls well that ends well,6.0,4.2.16,DIANA,As you owe to your wife.
14691,14692,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.2.17,BERTRAM,"No more o' that,"
14692,14693,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.2.18,BERTRAM,"I prithee, do not strive against my vows:"
14693,14694,Alls well that ends well,7.0,4.2.19,BERTRAM,"I was compell'd to her, but I love thee"

14696,14697,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.2.22,DIANA,"Ay, so you serve us"
14697,14698,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.2.23,DIANA,"Till we serve you, but when you have our roses,"
14698,14699,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.2.24,DIANA,You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
14699,14700,Alls well that ends well,8.0,4.2.25,DIANA,And mock us with our bareness.
14700,14701,Alls well that ends well,9.0,4.2.26,BERTRAM,How have I sworn!
14701,14702,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.27,DIANA,"'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,"
14702,14703,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.28,DIANA,But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
14703,14704,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.29,DIANA,"What is not holy, that we swear not by,"
14704,14705,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.30,DIANA,"But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,"
14705,14706,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.31,DIANA,"If I should swear by God's great attributes,"
14706,14707,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.32,DIANA,"I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,"
14707,14708,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.33,DIANA,"When I did love you ill? This has no holding,"
14708,14709,Alls well that ends well,10.0,4.2.34,DIANA,"To swear by him whom I protest to love,"

14771,14772,Alls well that ends well,4.0,4.3.7,Second Lord,Especially he hath incurred the everlasting

14802,14803,Alls well that ends well,16.0,4.3.38,Second Lord,What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel

15605,15606,Alls well that ends well,57.0,5.3.248,DIANA,I must be patient:

15634,15635,Alls well that ends well,72.0,5.3.276,KING,"How, I pray you?"
15635,15636,Alls well that ends well,73.0,5.3.277,PAROLLES,"He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman."
15636,15637,Alls well that ends well,74.0,5.3.278,KING,How is that?
15637,15638,Alls well that ends well,75.0,5.3.279,PAROLLES,"He loved her, sir, and loved her not."

15645,15646,Alls well that ends well,82.0,5.3.287,PAROLLES,"Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,"
15646,15647,Alls well that ends well,82.0,5.3.288,PAROLLES,"as I said, but more than that, he loved her: for"

15648,15649,Alls well that ends well,82.0,5.3.290,PAROLLES,of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
15649,15650,Alls well that ends well,82.0,5.3.291,PAROLLES,was in that credit with them at that time that I
15650,15651,Alls well that ends well,82.0,5.3.292,PAROLLES,"knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,"
15651,15652,Alls well that ends well,82.0,5.3.293,PAROLLES,"as promising her marriage, and things which would"

15653,15654,Alls well that ends well,82.0,5.3.295,PAROLLES,speak what I know.
15654,15655,Alls well that ends well,83.0,5.3.296,KING,"Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say"
15655,15656,Alls well that ends well,83.0,5.3.297,KING,they are married: but thou art too fine in thy

15658,15659,Alls well that ends well,84.0,5.3.300,DIANA,"Ay, my good lord."
15659,15660,Alls well that ends well,85.0,5.3.301,KING,Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
15660,15661,Alls well that ends well,86.0,5.3.302,DIANA,"It was not given me, nor I did not buy it."
15661,15662,Alls well that ends well,87.0,5.3.303,KING,Who lent it you?
15662,15663,Alls well that ends well,88.0,5.3.304,DIANA,It was not lent me neither.
15663,15664,Alls well that ends well,89.0,5.3.305,KING,"Where did you find it, then?"
15664,15665,Alls well that ends well,90.0,5.3.306,DIANA,I found it not.
15665,15666,Alls well that ends well,91.0,5.3.307,KING,"If it were yours by none of all these ways,"

15667,15668,Alls well that ends well,92.0,5.3.309,DIANA,I never gave it him.

15682,15683,Alls well that ends well,103.0,5.3.324,DIANA,"Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:"

15684,15685,Alls well that ends well,103.0,5.3.326,DIANA,"I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not."
15685,15686,Alls well that ends well,103.0,5.3.327,DIANA,"Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life,"
15686,15687,Alls well that ends well,103.0,5.3.328,DIANA,"I am either maid, or else this old man's wife."

15693,15694,Alls well that ends well,105.0,5.3.334,DIANA,"Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:"

15695,15696,Alls well that ends well,105.0,5.3.336,DIANA,And at that time he got his wife with child:
15696,15697,Alls well that ends well,105.0,5.3.337,DIANA,"Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:"
15697,15698,Alls well that ends well,105.0,5.3.338,DIANA,So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:

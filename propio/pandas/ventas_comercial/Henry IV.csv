1,2,Henry IV,,,,SCENE I. London. The palace.
2,3,Henry IV,,,,"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others"
3,4,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.1,KING HENRY IV,"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
4,5,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.2,KING HENRY IV,"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
5,6,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.3,KING HENRY IV,And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
6,7,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.4,KING HENRY IV,To be commenced in strands afar remote.
7,8,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.5,KING HENRY IV,No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
8,9,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.6,KING HENRY IV,"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,"
9,10,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.7,KING HENRY IV,"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
10,11,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.8,KING HENRY IV,Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
11,12,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.9,KING HENRY IV,"Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,"
12,13,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.10,KING HENRY IV,"Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,"
13,14,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.11,KING HENRY IV,"All of one nature, of one substance bred,"
14,15,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.12,KING HENRY IV,Did lately meet in the intestine shock
15,16,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.13,KING HENRY IV,And furious close of civil butchery
16,17,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.14,KING HENRY IV,"Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,"
17,18,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.15,KING HENRY IV,March all one way and be no more opposed
18,19,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.16,KING HENRY IV,"Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:"
19,20,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.17,KING HENRY IV,"The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,"
20,21,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.18,KING HENRY IV,"No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,"
21,22,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.19,KING HENRY IV,"As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,"
22,23,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.20,KING HENRY IV,"Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross"
23,24,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.21,KING HENRY IV,"We are impressed and engaged to fight,"
24,25,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.22,KING HENRY IV,"Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,"
25,26,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.23,KING HENRY IV,Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
26,27,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.24,KING HENRY IV,To chase these pagans in those holy fields
27,28,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.25,KING HENRY IV,Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
28,29,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.26,KING HENRY IV,Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
29,30,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.27,KING HENRY IV,For our advantage on the bitter cross.
30,31,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.28,KING HENRY IV,"But this our purpose now is twelve month old,"
31,32,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.29,KING HENRY IV,And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
32,33,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.30,KING HENRY IV,Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
33,34,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.31,KING HENRY IV,"Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,"
34,35,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.32,KING HENRY IV,What yesternight our council did decree
35,36,Henry IV,1.0,1.1.33,KING HENRY IV,In forwarding this dear expedience.
36,37,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.34,WESTMORELAND,"My liege, this haste was hot in question,"
37,38,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.35,WESTMORELAND,And many limits of the charge set down
38,39,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.36,WESTMORELAND,But yesternight: when all athwart there came
39,40,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.37,WESTMORELAND,"A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,"
40,41,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.38,WESTMORELAND,"Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,"
41,42,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.39,WESTMORELAND,Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
42,43,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.40,WESTMORELAND,"Against the irregular and wild Glendower,"
43,44,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.41,WESTMORELAND,"Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,"
44,45,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.42,WESTMORELAND,"A thousand of his people butchered,"
45,46,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.43,WESTMORELAND,"Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,"
46,47,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.44,WESTMORELAND,"Such beastly shameless transformation,"
47,48,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.45,WESTMORELAND,By those Welshwomen done as may not be
48,49,Henry IV,2.0,1.1.46,WESTMORELAND,Without much shame retold or spoken of.
49,50,Henry IV,3.0,1.1.47,KING HENRY IV,It seems then that the tidings of this broil
50,51,Henry IV,3.0,1.1.48,KING HENRY IV,Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
51,52,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.49,WESTMORELAND,"This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,"
52,53,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.50,WESTMORELAND,For more uneven and unwelcome news
53,54,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.51,WESTMORELAND,Came from the north and thus it did import:
54,55,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.52,WESTMORELAND,"On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,"
55,56,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.53,WESTMORELAND,"Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,"
56,57,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.54,WESTMORELAND,"That ever-valiant and approved Scot,"
57,58,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.55,WESTMORELAND,"At Holmedon met,"
58,59,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.56,WESTMORELAND,"Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,"
59,60,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.57,WESTMORELAND,"As by discharge of their artillery,"
60,61,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.58,WESTMORELAND,"And shape of likelihood, the news was told,"
61,62,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.59,WESTMORELAND,"For he that brought them, in the very heat"
62,63,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.60,WESTMORELAND,"And pride of their contention did take horse,"
63,64,Henry IV,4.0,1.1.61,WESTMORELAND,Uncertain of the issue any way.
64,65,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.62,KING HENRY IV,"Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,"
65,66,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.63,KING HENRY IV,"Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse."
66,67,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.64,KING HENRY IV,Stain'd with the variation of each soil
67,68,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.65,KING HENRY IV,"Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,"
68,69,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.66,KING HENRY IV,And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
69,70,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.67,KING HENRY IV,The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
70,71,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.68,KING HENRY IV,"Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,"
71,72,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.69,KING HENRY IV,Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
72,73,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.70,KING HENRY IV,"On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took"
73,74,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.71,KING HENRY IV,"Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son"
74,75,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.72,KING HENRY IV,"To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,"
75,76,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.73,KING HENRY IV,"Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:"
76,77,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.74,KING HENRY IV,And is not this an honourable spoil?
77,78,Henry IV,5.0,1.1.75,KING HENRY IV,"A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?"
78,79,Henry IV,6.0,1.1.76,WESTMORELAND,"In faith,"
79,80,Henry IV,6.0,1.1.77,WESTMORELAND,It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
80,81,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.78,KING HENRY IV,"Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin"
81,82,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.79,KING HENRY IV,In envy that my Lord Northumberland
82,83,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.80,KING HENRY IV,"Should be the father to so blest a son,"
83,84,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.81,KING HENRY IV,"A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,"
84,85,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.82,KING HENRY IV,"Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,"
85,86,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.83,KING HENRY IV,Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
86,87,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.84,KING HENRY IV,"Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,"
87,88,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.85,KING HENRY IV,See riot and dishonour stain the brow
88,89,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.86,KING HENRY IV,Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
89,90,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.87,KING HENRY IV,That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
90,91,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.88,KING HENRY IV,"In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,"
91,92,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.89,KING HENRY IV,"And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!"
92,93,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.90,KING HENRY IV,"Then would I have his Harry, and he mine."
93,94,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.91,KING HENRY IV,"But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,"
94,95,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.92,KING HENRY IV,"Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,"
95,96,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.93,KING HENRY IV,"Which he in this adventure hath surprised,"
96,97,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.94,KING HENRY IV,"To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,"
97,98,Henry IV,7.0,1.1.95,KING HENRY IV,I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
98,99,Henry IV,8.0,1.1.96,WESTMORELAND,"This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,"
99,100,Henry IV,8.0,1.1.97,WESTMORELAND,"Malevolent to you in all aspects,"
100,101,Henry IV,8.0,1.1.98,WESTMORELAND,"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up"
101,102,Henry IV,8.0,1.1.99,WESTMORELAND,The crest of youth against your dignity.
102,103,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.100,KING HENRY IV,"But I have sent for him to answer this,"
103,104,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.101,KING HENRY IV,And for this cause awhile we must neglect
104,105,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.102,KING HENRY IV,Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
105,106,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.103,KING HENRY IV,"Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we"
106,107,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.104,KING HENRY IV,"Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords:"
107,108,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.105,KING HENRY IV,"But come yourself with speed to us again,"
108,109,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.106,KING HENRY IV,For more is to be said and to be done
109,110,Henry IV,9.0,1.1.107,KING HENRY IV,Than out of anger can be uttered.
110,111,Henry IV,10.0,1.1.108,WESTMORELAND,"I will, my liege."
111,112,Henry IV,10.0,,WESTMORELAND,Exeunt
112,113,Henry IV,10.0,,WESTMORELAND,SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
113,114,Henry IV,10.0,,WESTMORELAND,Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
114,115,Henry IV,1.0,1.2.1,FALSTAFF,"Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
115,116,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.2,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack"
116,117,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.3,PRINCE HENRY,and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
117,118,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.4,PRINCE HENRY,"benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to"
118,119,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.5,PRINCE HENRY,demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
119,120,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.6,PRINCE HENRY,What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
120,121,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.7,PRINCE HENRY,day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
121,122,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.8,PRINCE HENRY,capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
122,123,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.9,PRINCE HENRY,signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
123,124,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.10,PRINCE HENRY,"a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no"
124,125,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.11,PRINCE HENRY,reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
125,126,Henry IV,2.0,1.2.12,PRINCE HENRY,the time of the day.
126,127,Henry IV,3.0,1.2.13,FALSTAFF,"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take"
127,128,Henry IV,3.0,1.2.14,FALSTAFF,"purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not"
128,129,Henry IV,3.0,1.2.15,FALSTAFF,"by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,"
129,130,Henry IV,3.0,1.2.16,FALSTAFF,"I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God"
130,131,Henry IV,3.0,1.2.17,FALSTAFF,"save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace"
131,132,Henry IV,3.0,1.2.18,FALSTAFF,"thou wilt have none,--"
132,133,Henry IV,4.0,1.2.19,PRINCE HENRY,"What, none?"
133,134,Henry IV,5.0,1.2.20,FALSTAFF,"No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to"
134,135,Henry IV,5.0,1.2.21,FALSTAFF,prologue to an egg and butter.
135,136,Henry IV,6.0,1.2.22,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly."
136,137,Henry IV,7.0,1.2.23,FALSTAFF,"Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not"
137,138,Henry IV,7.0,1.2.24,FALSTAFF,us that are squires of the night's body be called
138,139,Henry IV,7.0,1.2.25,FALSTAFF,thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
139,140,Henry IV,7.0,1.2.26,FALSTAFF,"foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the"
140,141,Henry IV,7.0,1.2.27,FALSTAFF,"moon, and let men say we be men of good government,"
141,142,Henry IV,7.0,1.2.28,FALSTAFF,"being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and"
142,143,Henry IV,7.0,1.2.29,FALSTAFF,"chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
143,144,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.30,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the"
144,145,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.31,PRINCE HENRY,fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
145,146,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.32,PRINCE HENRY,"flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,"
146,147,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.33,PRINCE HENRY,"by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold"
147,148,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.34,PRINCE HENRY,most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
148,149,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.35,PRINCE HENRY,"dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with"
149,150,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.36,PRINCE HENRY,"swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'"
150,151,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.37,PRINCE HENRY,now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
151,152,Henry IV,8.0,1.2.38,PRINCE HENRY,and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
152,153,Henry IV,9.0,1.2.39,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my"
153,154,Henry IV,9.0,1.2.40,FALSTAFF,hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
154,155,Henry IV,10.0,1.2.41,PRINCE HENRY,"As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And"
155,156,Henry IV,10.0,1.2.42,PRINCE HENRY,is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
156,157,Henry IV,11.0,1.2.43,FALSTAFF,"How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and"
157,158,Henry IV,11.0,1.2.44,FALSTAFF,thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
158,159,Henry IV,11.0,1.2.45,FALSTAFF,buff jerkin?
159,160,Henry IV,12.0,1.2.46,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
160,161,Henry IV,13.0,1.2.47,FALSTAFF,"Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a"
161,162,Henry IV,13.0,1.2.48,FALSTAFF,time and oft.
162,163,Henry IV,14.0,1.2.49,PRINCE HENRY,Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
163,164,Henry IV,15.0,1.2.50,FALSTAFF,"No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there."
164,165,Henry IV,16.0,1.2.51,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,"
165,166,Henry IV,16.0,1.2.52,PRINCE HENRY,"and where it would not, I have used my credit."
166,167,Henry IV,17.0,1.2.53,FALSTAFF,"Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent"
167,168,Henry IV,17.0,1.2.54,FALSTAFF,"that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet"
168,169,Henry IV,17.0,1.2.55,FALSTAFF,"wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when"
169,170,Henry IV,17.0,1.2.56,FALSTAFF,thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
170,171,Henry IV,17.0,1.2.57,FALSTAFF,with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
171,172,Henry IV,17.0,1.2.58,FALSTAFF,"not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
172,173,Henry IV,18.0,1.2.59,PRINCE HENRY,"No, thou shalt."
173,174,Henry IV,19.0,1.2.60,FALSTAFF,"Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge."
174,175,Henry IV,20.0,1.2.61,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have"
175,176,Henry IV,20.0,1.2.62,PRINCE HENRY,the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
176,177,Henry IV,21.0,1.2.63,FALSTAFF,"Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my"
177,178,Henry IV,21.0,1.2.64,FALSTAFF,"humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell"
178,179,Henry IV,21.0,1.2.65,FALSTAFF,you.
179,180,Henry IV,22.0,1.2.66,PRINCE HENRY,For obtaining of suits?
180,181,Henry IV,23.0,1.2.67,FALSTAFF,"Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman"
181,182,Henry IV,23.0,1.2.68,FALSTAFF,"hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy"
182,183,Henry IV,23.0,1.2.69,FALSTAFF,as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
183,184,Henry IV,24.0,1.2.70,PRINCE HENRY,"Or an old lion, or a lover's lute."
184,185,Henry IV,25.0,1.2.71,FALSTAFF,"Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
185,186,Henry IV,26.0,1.2.72,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
186,187,Henry IV,26.0,1.2.73,PRINCE HENRY,Moor-ditch?
187,188,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.74,FALSTAFF,Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
188,189,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.75,FALSTAFF,"the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young"
189,190,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.76,FALSTAFF,"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more"
190,191,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.77,FALSTAFF,with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
191,192,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.78,FALSTAFF,commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
192,193,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.79,FALSTAFF,lord of the council rated me the other day in the
193,194,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.80,FALSTAFF,"street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet"
194,195,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.81,FALSTAFF,"he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and"
195,196,Henry IV,27.0,1.2.82,FALSTAFF,"yet he talked wisely, and in the street too."
196,197,Henry IV,28.0,1.2.83,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the"
197,198,Henry IV,28.0,1.2.84,PRINCE HENRY,"streets, and no man regards it."
198,199,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.85,FALSTAFF,"O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able"
199,200,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.86,FALSTAFF,to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
200,201,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.87,FALSTAFF,"me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew"
201,202,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.88,FALSTAFF,"thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man"
202,203,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.89,FALSTAFF,"should speak truly, little better than one of the"
203,204,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.90,FALSTAFF,"wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give"
204,205,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.91,FALSTAFF,"it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:"
205,206,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.92,FALSTAFF,I'll be damned for never a king's son in
206,207,Henry IV,29.0,1.2.93,FALSTAFF,Christendom.

210,211,Henry IV,32.0,1.2.97,PRINCE HENRY,"I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying"
211,212,Henry IV,32.0,1.2.98,PRINCE HENRY,to purse-taking.
212,213,Henry IV,33.0,1.2.99,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a"
213,214,Henry IV,33.0,1.2.100,FALSTAFF,man to labour in his vocation.
214,215,Henry IV,33.0,,FALSTAFF,Enter POINS
215,216,Henry IV,33.0,1.2.101,FALSTAFF,Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
216,217,Henry IV,33.0,1.2.102,FALSTAFF,"match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what"
217,218,Henry IV,33.0,1.2.103,FALSTAFF,hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
218,219,Henry IV,33.0,1.2.104,FALSTAFF,most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
219,220,Henry IV,33.0,1.2.105,FALSTAFF,a true man.
220,221,Henry IV,34.0,1.2.106,PRINCE HENRY,"Good morrow, Ned."
221,222,Henry IV,35.0,1.2.107,POINS,"Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?"
222,223,Henry IV,35.0,1.2.108,POINS,what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how

224,225,Henry IV,35.0,1.2.110,POINS,soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
225,226,Henry IV,35.0,1.2.111,POINS,and a cold capon's leg?
226,227,Henry IV,36.0,1.2.112,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have"
227,228,Henry IV,36.0,1.2.113,PRINCE HENRY,"his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of"
228,229,Henry IV,36.0,1.2.114,PRINCE HENRY,proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
229,230,Henry IV,37.0,1.2.115,POINS,Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
230,231,Henry IV,38.0,1.2.116,PRINCE HENRY,Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.

232,233,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.118,POINS,"o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going"
233,234,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.119,POINS,"to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders"
234,235,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.120,POINS,riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards

236,237,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.122,POINS,Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
237,238,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.123,POINS,supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
238,239,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.124,POINS,"as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff"
239,240,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.125,POINS,"your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry"
240,241,Henry IV,39.0,1.2.126,POINS,at home and be hanged.

242,243,Henry IV,40.0,1.2.128,FALSTAFF,I'll hang you for going.
243,244,Henry IV,41.0,1.2.129,POINS,"You will, chops?"

245,246,Henry IV,43.0,1.2.131,PRINCE HENRY,"Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith."
246,247,Henry IV,44.0,1.2.132,FALSTAFF,"There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good"

250,251,Henry IV,46.0,1.2.136,FALSTAFF,"Why, that's well said."
251,252,Henry IV,47.0,1.2.137,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home."
252,253,Henry IV,48.0,1.2.138,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king."
253,254,Henry IV,49.0,1.2.139,PRINCE HENRY,I care not.

255,256,Henry IV,50.0,1.2.141,POINS,I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
256,257,Henry IV,50.0,1.2.142,POINS,that he shall go.

262,263,Henry IV,51.0,1.2.148,FALSTAFF,countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
263,264,Henry IV,52.0,1.2.149,PRINCE HENRY,"Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!"

266,267,Henry IV,53.0,1.2.151,POINS,to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
267,268,Henry IV,53.0,1.2.152,POINS,"manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill"
268,269,Henry IV,53.0,1.2.153,POINS,shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
269,270,Henry IV,53.0,1.2.154,POINS,"yourself and I will not be there, and when they"
270,271,Henry IV,53.0,1.2.155,POINS,"have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut"
271,272,Henry IV,53.0,1.2.156,POINS,this head off from my shoulders.
272,273,Henry IV,54.0,1.2.157,PRINCE HENRY,How shall we part with them in setting forth?
273,274,Henry IV,55.0,1.2.158,POINS,"Why, we will set forth before or after them, and"
274,275,Henry IV,55.0,1.2.159,POINS,"appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at"
275,276,Henry IV,55.0,1.2.160,POINS,"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure"
276,277,Henry IV,55.0,1.2.161,POINS,"upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have"
277,278,Henry IV,55.0,1.2.162,POINS,"no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them."
278,279,Henry IV,56.0,1.2.163,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our"
279,280,Henry IV,56.0,1.2.164,PRINCE HENRY,"horses, by our habits and by every other"
280,281,Henry IV,56.0,1.2.165,PRINCE HENRY,"appointment, to be ourselves."
281,282,Henry IV,57.0,1.2.166,POINS,Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
282,283,Henry IV,57.0,1.2.167,POINS,"in the wood, our vizards we will change after we"
283,284,Henry IV,57.0,1.2.168,POINS,"leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram"
284,285,Henry IV,57.0,1.2.169,POINS,"for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
285,286,Henry IV,58.0,1.2.170,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."
286,287,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.171,POINS,"Well, for two of them, I know them to be as"
287,288,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.172,POINS,"true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the"
288,289,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.173,POINS,"third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll"
289,290,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.174,POINS,"forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the"
290,291,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.175,POINS,incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
291,292,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.176,POINS,"tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at"
292,293,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.177,POINS,"least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what"
293,294,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.178,POINS,"extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this"
294,295,Henry IV,59.0,1.2.179,POINS,lies the jest.
295,296,Henry IV,60.0,1.2.180,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things"
296,297,Henry IV,60.0,1.2.181,PRINCE HENRY,"necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,"
297,298,Henry IV,60.0,1.2.182,PRINCE HENRY,there I'll sup. Farewell.

304,305,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.188,PRINCE HENRY,"To smother up his beauty from the world,"
305,306,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.189,PRINCE HENRY,"That, when he please again to be himself,"
306,307,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.190,PRINCE HENRY,"Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,"
307,308,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.191,PRINCE HENRY,By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
308,309,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.192,PRINCE HENRY,Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
309,310,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.193,PRINCE HENRY,"If all the year were playing holidays,"

315,316,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.199,PRINCE HENRY,"By how much better than my word I am,"
316,317,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.200,PRINCE HENRY,"By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,"
317,318,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.201,PRINCE HENRY,"And like bright metal on a sullen ground,"

319,320,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.203,PRINCE HENRY,Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
320,321,Henry IV,62.0,1.2.204,PRINCE HENRY,Than that which hath no foil to set it off.

394,395,Henry IV,6.0,1.3.67,HOTSPUR,"I answer'd indirectly, as I said,"
395,396,Henry IV,6.0,1.3.68,HOTSPUR,"And I beseech you, let not his report"
396,397,Henry IV,6.0,1.3.69,HOTSPUR,Come current for an accusation

426,427,Henry IV,9.0,1.3.99,HOTSPUR,"When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,"
427,428,Henry IV,9.0,1.3.100,HOTSPUR,"In single opposition, hand to hand,"
428,429,Henry IV,9.0,1.3.101,HOTSPUR,He did confound the best part of an hour

465,466,Henry IV,13.0,1.3.136,HOTSPUR,"Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,"
466,467,Henry IV,13.0,1.3.137,HOTSPUR,"And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
467,468,Henry IV,13.0,1.3.138,HOTSPUR,But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
468,469,Henry IV,13.0,1.3.139,HOTSPUR,"As high in the air as this unthankful king,"
469,470,Henry IV,13.0,1.3.140,HOTSPUR,As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
470,471,Henry IV,14.0,1.3.141,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad."
471,472,Henry IV,15.0,1.3.142,EARL OF WORCESTER,Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
472,473,Henry IV,16.0,1.3.143,HOTSPUR,"He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,"
473,474,Henry IV,16.0,1.3.144,HOTSPUR,And when I urged the ransom once again
474,475,Henry IV,16.0,1.3.145,HOTSPUR,"Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,"
475,476,Henry IV,16.0,1.3.146,HOTSPUR,"And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,"
476,477,Henry IV,16.0,1.3.147,HOTSPUR,Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
477,478,Henry IV,17.0,1.3.148,EARL OF WORCESTER,I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
478,479,Henry IV,17.0,1.3.149,EARL OF WORCESTER,By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
479,480,Henry IV,18.0,1.3.150,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He was, I heard the proclamation:"
480,481,Henry IV,18.0,1.3.151,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And then it was when the unhappy king,"
481,482,Henry IV,18.0,1.3.152,NORTHUMBERLAND,--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
482,483,Henry IV,18.0,1.3.153,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Upon his Irish expedition,"
483,484,Henry IV,18.0,1.3.154,NORTHUMBERLAND,From whence he intercepted did return
484,485,Henry IV,18.0,1.3.155,NORTHUMBERLAND,To be deposed and shortly murdered.
485,486,Henry IV,19.0,1.3.156,EARL OF WORCESTER,And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
486,487,Henry IV,19.0,1.3.157,EARL OF WORCESTER,Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
487,488,Henry IV,20.0,1.3.158,HOTSPUR,"But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then"
488,489,Henry IV,20.0,1.3.159,HOTSPUR,Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
489,490,Henry IV,20.0,1.3.160,HOTSPUR,Heir to the crown?
490,491,Henry IV,21.0,1.3.161,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He did, myself did hear it."
491,492,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.162,HOTSPUR,"Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,"
492,493,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.163,HOTSPUR,That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
493,494,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.164,HOTSPUR,"But shall it be that you, that set the crown"
494,495,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.165,HOTSPUR,Upon the head of this forgetful man
495,496,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.166,HOTSPUR,And for his sake wear the detested blot
496,497,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.167,HOTSPUR,"Of murderous subornation, shall it be,"
497,498,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.168,HOTSPUR,"That you a world of curses undergo,"
498,499,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.169,HOTSPUR,"Being the agents, or base second means,"
499,500,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.170,HOTSPUR,"The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?"
500,501,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.171,HOTSPUR,"O, pardon me that I descend so low,"
501,502,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.172,HOTSPUR,To show the line and the predicament
502,503,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.173,HOTSPUR,"Wherein you range under this subtle king,"
503,504,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.174,HOTSPUR,"Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,"
504,505,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.175,HOTSPUR,"Or fill up chronicles in time to come,"
505,506,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.176,HOTSPUR,That men of your nobility and power
506,507,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.177,HOTSPUR,"Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,"
507,508,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.178,HOTSPUR,"As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,"
508,509,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.179,HOTSPUR,"To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,"
509,510,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.180,HOTSPUR,"An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?"
510,511,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.181,HOTSPUR,"And shall it in more shame be further spoken,"
511,512,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.182,HOTSPUR,"That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off"
512,513,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.183,HOTSPUR,By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
513,514,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.184,HOTSPUR,"No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem"
514,515,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.185,HOTSPUR,Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves

518,519,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.189,HOTSPUR,To answer all the debt he owes to you
519,520,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.190,HOTSPUR,Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
520,521,Henry IV,22.0,1.3.191,HOTSPUR,"Therefore, I say--"

525,526,Henry IV,23.0,1.3.196,EARL OF WORCESTER,As full of peril and adventurous spirit
526,527,Henry IV,23.0,1.3.197,EARL OF WORCESTER,As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
527,528,Henry IV,23.0,1.3.198,EARL OF WORCESTER,On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
528,529,Henry IV,24.0,1.3.199,HOTSPUR,"If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:"
529,530,Henry IV,24.0,1.3.200,HOTSPUR,"Send danger from the east unto the west,"
530,531,Henry IV,24.0,1.3.201,HOTSPUR,"So honour cross it from the north to south,"
531,532,Henry IV,24.0,1.3.202,HOTSPUR,"And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs"
532,533,Henry IV,24.0,1.3.203,HOTSPUR,To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
533,534,Henry IV,25.0,1.3.204,NORTHUMBERLAND,Imagination of some great exploit
534,535,Henry IV,25.0,1.3.205,NORTHUMBERLAND,Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
535,536,Henry IV,26.0,1.3.206,HOTSPUR,"By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,"
536,537,Henry IV,26.0,1.3.207,HOTSPUR,"To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,"
537,538,Henry IV,26.0,1.3.208,HOTSPUR,"Or dive into the bottom of the deep,"
538,539,Henry IV,26.0,1.3.209,HOTSPUR,"Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,"
539,540,Henry IV,26.0,1.3.210,HOTSPUR,"And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,"

544,545,Henry IV,27.0,1.3.215,EARL OF WORCESTER,But not the form of what he should attend.
545,546,Henry IV,27.0,1.3.216,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Good cousin, give me audience for a while."
546,547,Henry IV,28.0,1.3.217,HOTSPUR,I cry you mercy.
547,548,Henry IV,29.0,1.3.218,EARL OF WORCESTER,Those same noble Scots

1550,1551,Henry IV,1.0,3.1.1,MORTIMER,"These promises are fair, the parties sure,"
1551,1552,Henry IV,1.0,3.1.2,MORTIMER,And our induction full of prosperous hope.
1552,1553,Henry IV,2.0,3.1.3,HOTSPUR,"Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,"
1553,1554,Henry IV,2.0,3.1.4,HOTSPUR,Will you sit down?
1554,1555,Henry IV,2.0,3.1.5,HOTSPUR,And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
1555,1556,Henry IV,2.0,3.1.6,HOTSPUR,I have forgot the map.
1556,1557,Henry IV,3.0,3.1.7,GLENDOWER,"No, here it is."
1557,1558,Henry IV,3.0,3.1.8,GLENDOWER,"Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,"
1558,1559,Henry IV,3.0,3.1.9,GLENDOWER,For by that name as oft as Lancaster
1559,1560,Henry IV,3.0,3.1.10,GLENDOWER,"Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with"
1560,1561,Henry IV,3.0,3.1.11,GLENDOWER,A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
1561,1562,Henry IV,4.0,3.1.12,HOTSPUR,"And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of."
1562,1563,Henry IV,5.0,3.1.13,GLENDOWER,I cannot blame him: at my nativity
1563,1564,Henry IV,5.0,3.1.14,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1564,1565,Henry IV,5.0,3.1.15,GLENDOWER,"Of burning cressets, and at my birth"
1565,1566,Henry IV,5.0,3.1.16,GLENDOWER,The frame and huge foundation of the earth
1566,1567,Henry IV,5.0,3.1.17,GLENDOWER,Shaked like a coward.
1567,1568,Henry IV,6.0,3.1.18,HOTSPUR,"Why, so it would have done at the same season, if"
1568,1569,Henry IV,6.0,3.1.19,HOTSPUR,"your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself"
1569,1570,Henry IV,6.0,3.1.20,HOTSPUR,had never been born.
1570,1571,Henry IV,7.0,3.1.21,GLENDOWER,I say the earth did shake when I was born.
1571,1572,Henry IV,8.0,3.1.22,HOTSPUR,"And I say the earth was not of my mind,"
1572,1573,Henry IV,8.0,3.1.23,HOTSPUR,If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
1573,1574,Henry IV,9.0,3.1.24,GLENDOWER,"The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble."
1574,1575,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.25,HOTSPUR,"O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,"
1575,1576,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.26,HOTSPUR,And not in fear of your nativity.
1576,1577,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.27,HOTSPUR,Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
1577,1578,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.28,HOTSPUR,"In strange eruptions, oft the teeming earth"
1578,1579,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.29,HOTSPUR,Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
1579,1580,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.30,HOTSPUR,By the imprisoning of unruly wind
1580,1581,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.31,HOTSPUR,"Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,"
1581,1582,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.32,HOTSPUR,Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
1582,1583,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.33,HOTSPUR,Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
1583,1584,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.34,HOTSPUR,"Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,"
1584,1585,Henry IV,10.0,3.1.35,HOTSPUR,In passion shook.
1585,1586,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.36,GLENDOWER,"Cousin, of many men"
1586,1587,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.37,GLENDOWER,I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
1587,1588,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.38,GLENDOWER,To tell you once again that at my birth
1588,1589,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.39,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1589,1590,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.40,GLENDOWER,"The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds"
1590,1591,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.41,GLENDOWER,Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
1591,1592,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.42,GLENDOWER,"These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,"
1592,1593,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.43,GLENDOWER,And all the courses of my life do show
1593,1594,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.44,GLENDOWER,I am not in the roll of common men.
1594,1595,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.45,GLENDOWER,"Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea"
1595,1596,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.46,GLENDOWER,"That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,"
1596,1597,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.47,GLENDOWER,"Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?"
1597,1598,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.48,GLENDOWER,And bring him out that is but woman's son
1598,1599,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.49,GLENDOWER,Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
1599,1600,Henry IV,11.0,3.1.50,GLENDOWER,And hold me pace in deep experiments.
1600,1601,Henry IV,12.0,3.1.51,HOTSPUR,I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
1601,1602,Henry IV,12.0,3.1.52,HOTSPUR,I'll to dinner.
1602,1603,Henry IV,13.0,3.1.53,MORTIMER,"Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad."
1603,1604,Henry IV,14.0,3.1.54,GLENDOWER,I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
1604,1605,Henry IV,15.0,3.1.55,HOTSPUR,"Why, so can I, or so can any man,"
1605,1606,Henry IV,15.0,3.1.56,HOTSPUR,But will they come when you do call for them?
1606,1607,Henry IV,16.0,3.1.57,GLENDOWER,"Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command"
1607,1608,Henry IV,16.0,3.1.58,GLENDOWER,The devil.
1608,1609,Henry IV,17.0,3.1.59,HOTSPUR,"And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil"
1609,1610,Henry IV,17.0,3.1.60,HOTSPUR,By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
1610,1611,Henry IV,17.0,3.1.61,HOTSPUR,"If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,"
1611,1612,Henry IV,17.0,3.1.62,HOTSPUR,And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
1612,1613,Henry IV,17.0,3.1.63,HOTSPUR,"O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!"
1613,1614,Henry IV,18.0,3.1.64,MORTIMER,"Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat."
1614,1615,Henry IV,19.0,3.1.65,GLENDOWER,Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
1615,1616,Henry IV,19.0,3.1.66,GLENDOWER,"Against my power, thrice from the banks of Wye"
1616,1617,Henry IV,19.0,3.1.67,GLENDOWER,And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
1617,1618,Henry IV,19.0,3.1.68,GLENDOWER,Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
1618,1619,Henry IV,20.0,3.1.69,HOTSPUR,"Home without boots, and in foul weather too!"
1619,1620,Henry IV,20.0,3.1.70,HOTSPUR,"How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?"
1620,1621,Henry IV,21.0,3.1.71,GLENDOWER,"Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right"
1621,1622,Henry IV,21.0,3.1.72,GLENDOWER,According to our threefold order ta'en?
1622,1623,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.73,MORTIMER,The archdeacon hath divided it
1623,1624,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.74,MORTIMER,Into three limits very equally:
1624,1625,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.75,MORTIMER,"England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,"
1625,1626,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.76,MORTIMER,By south and east is to my part assign'd:
1626,1627,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.77,MORTIMER,"All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,"
1627,1628,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.78,MORTIMER,"And all the fertile land within that bound,"
1628,1629,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.79,MORTIMER,"To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you"
1629,1630,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.80,MORTIMER,"The remnant northward, lying off from Trent."
1630,1631,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.81,MORTIMER,"And our indentures tripartite are drawn,"
1631,1632,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.82,MORTIMER,"Which being sealed interchangeably,"
1632,1633,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.83,MORTIMER,"A business that this night may execute,"
1633,1634,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.84,MORTIMER,"To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I"
1634,1635,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.85,MORTIMER,And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
1635,1636,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.86,MORTIMER,"To meet your father and the Scottish power,"
1636,1637,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.87,MORTIMER,"As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury."
1637,1638,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.88,MORTIMER,"My father Glendower is not ready yet,"
1638,1639,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.89,MORTIMER,Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
1639,1640,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.90,MORTIMER,Within that space you may have drawn together
1640,1641,Henry IV,22.0,3.1.91,MORTIMER,"Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen."
1641,1642,Henry IV,23.0,3.1.92,GLENDOWER,"A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:"
1642,1643,Henry IV,23.0,3.1.93,GLENDOWER,"And in my conduct shall your ladies come,"
1643,1644,Henry IV,23.0,3.1.94,GLENDOWER,"From whom you now must steal and take no leave,"
1644,1645,Henry IV,23.0,3.1.95,GLENDOWER,For there will be a world of water shed
1645,1646,Henry IV,23.0,3.1.96,GLENDOWER,Upon the parting of your wives and you.
1646,1647,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.97,HOTSPUR,"Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,"
1647,1648,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.98,HOTSPUR,In quantity equals not one of yours:
1648,1649,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.99,HOTSPUR,"See how this river comes me cranking in,"
1649,1650,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.100,HOTSPUR,And cuts me from the best of all my land
1650,1651,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.101,HOTSPUR,"A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out."
1651,1652,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.102,HOTSPUR,"I'll have the current in this place damm'd up,"
1652,1653,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.103,HOTSPUR,And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
1653,1654,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.104,HOTSPUR,"In a new channel, fair and evenly,"
1654,1655,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.105,HOTSPUR,"It shall not wind with such a deep indent,"
1655,1656,Henry IV,24.0,3.1.106,HOTSPUR,To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
1656,1657,Henry IV,25.0,3.1.107,GLENDOWER,"Not wind? it shall, it must, you see it doth."
1657,1658,Henry IV,26.0,3.1.108,MORTIMER,"Yea, but"
1658,1659,Henry IV,26.0,3.1.109,MORTIMER,"Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up"
1659,1660,Henry IV,26.0,3.1.110,MORTIMER,"With like advantage on the other side,"
1660,1661,Henry IV,26.0,3.1.111,MORTIMER,Gelding the opposed continent as much
1661,1662,Henry IV,26.0,3.1.112,MORTIMER,As on the other side it takes from you.
1662,1663,Henry IV,27.0,3.1.113,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yea, but a little charge will trench him here"
1663,1664,Henry IV,27.0,3.1.114,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And on this north side win this cape of land,"
1664,1665,Henry IV,27.0,3.1.115,EARL OF WORCESTER,And then he runs straight and even.
1665,1666,Henry IV,28.0,3.1.116,HOTSPUR,I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
1666,1667,Henry IV,29.0,3.1.117,GLENDOWER,I'll not have it alter'd.
1667,1668,Henry IV,30.0,3.1.118,HOTSPUR,Will not you?
1668,1669,Henry IV,31.0,3.1.119,GLENDOWER,"No, nor you shall not."
1669,1670,Henry IV,32.0,3.1.120,HOTSPUR,Who shall say me nay?
1670,1671,Henry IV,33.0,3.1.121,GLENDOWER,"Why, that will I."
1671,1672,Henry IV,34.0,3.1.122,HOTSPUR,"Let me not understand you, then, speak it in Welsh."
1672,1673,Henry IV,35.0,3.1.123,GLENDOWER,"I can speak English, lord, as well as you,"
1673,1674,Henry IV,35.0,3.1.124,GLENDOWER,"For I was train'd up in the English court,"
1674,1675,Henry IV,35.0,3.1.125,GLENDOWER,"Where, being but young, I framed to the harp"
1675,1676,Henry IV,35.0,3.1.126,GLENDOWER,Many an English ditty lovely well
1676,1677,Henry IV,35.0,3.1.127,GLENDOWER,"And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,"
1677,1678,Henry IV,35.0,3.1.128,GLENDOWER,A virtue that was never seen in you.
1678,1679,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.129,HOTSPUR,"Marry,"
1679,1680,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.130,HOTSPUR,And I am glad of it with all my heart:
1680,1681,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.131,HOTSPUR,I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
1681,1682,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.132,HOTSPUR,"Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers,"
1682,1683,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.133,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,"
1683,1684,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.134,HOTSPUR,"Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,"
1684,1685,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.135,HOTSPUR,"And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,"
1685,1686,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.136,HOTSPUR,Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
1686,1687,Henry IV,36.0,3.1.137,HOTSPUR,'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
1687,1688,Henry IV,37.0,3.1.138,GLENDOWER,"Come, you shall have Trent turn'd."
1688,1689,Henry IV,38.0,3.1.139,HOTSPUR,I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
1689,1690,Henry IV,38.0,3.1.140,HOTSPUR,"To any well-deserving friend,"
1690,1691,Henry IV,38.0,3.1.141,HOTSPUR,"But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,"
1691,1692,Henry IV,38.0,3.1.142,HOTSPUR,I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
1692,1693,Henry IV,38.0,3.1.143,HOTSPUR,Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
1693,1694,Henry IV,39.0,3.1.144,GLENDOWER,"The moon shines fair, you may away by night:"
1694,1695,Henry IV,39.0,3.1.145,GLENDOWER,I'll haste the writer and withal
1695,1696,Henry IV,39.0,3.1.146,GLENDOWER,Break with your wives of your departure hence:
1696,1697,Henry IV,39.0,3.1.147,GLENDOWER,"I am afraid my daughter will run mad,"
1697,1698,Henry IV,39.0,3.1.148,GLENDOWER,So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
1698,1699,Henry IV,39.0,,GLENDOWER,Exit GLENDOWER
1699,1700,Henry IV,40.0,3.1.149,MORTIMER,"Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!"
1700,1701,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.150,HOTSPUR,I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
1701,1702,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.151,HOTSPUR,"With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,"
1702,1703,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.152,HOTSPUR,"Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,"
1703,1704,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.153,HOTSPUR,"And of a dragon and a finless fish,"
1704,1705,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.154,HOTSPUR,"A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,"
1705,1706,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.155,HOTSPUR,"A couching lion and a ramping cat,"
1706,1707,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.156,HOTSPUR,And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
1707,1708,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.157,HOTSPUR,"As puts me from my faith. I tell you what,"
1708,1709,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.158,HOTSPUR,He held me last night at least nine hours
1709,1710,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.159,HOTSPUR,In reckoning up the several devils' names
1710,1711,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.160,HOTSPUR,"That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'"
1711,1712,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.161,HOTSPUR,"But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious"
1712,1713,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.162,HOTSPUR,"As a tired horse, a railing wife,"
1713,1714,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.163,HOTSPUR,Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
1714,1715,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.164,HOTSPUR,"With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,"
1715,1716,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.165,HOTSPUR,Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
1716,1717,Henry IV,41.0,3.1.166,HOTSPUR,In any summer-house in Christendom.
1717,1718,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.167,MORTIMER,"In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,"
1718,1719,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.168,MORTIMER,"Exceedingly well read, and profited"
1719,1720,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.169,MORTIMER,"In strange concealments, valiant as a lion"
1720,1721,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.170,MORTIMER,And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
1721,1722,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.171,MORTIMER,"As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?"
1722,1723,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.172,MORTIMER,He holds your temper in a high respect
1723,1724,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.173,MORTIMER,And curbs himself even of his natural scope
1724,1725,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.174,MORTIMER,"When you come 'cross his humour, faith, he does:"
1725,1726,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.175,MORTIMER,"I warrant you, that man is not alive"
1726,1727,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.176,MORTIMER,"Might so have tempted him as you have done,"
1727,1728,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.177,MORTIMER,Without the taste of danger and reproof:
1728,1729,Henry IV,42.0,3.1.178,MORTIMER,"But do not use it oft, let me entreat you."
1729,1730,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.179,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,"
1730,1731,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.180,EARL OF WORCESTER,And since your coming hither have done enough
1731,1732,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.181,EARL OF WORCESTER,To put him quite beside his patience.
1732,1733,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.182,EARL OF WORCESTER,"You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:"
1733,1734,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.183,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--"
1734,1735,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.184,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--"
1735,1736,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.185,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,"

1739,1740,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.189,EARL OF WORCESTER,Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain

1741,1742,Henry IV,43.0,3.1.191,EARL OF WORCESTER,Beguiling them of commendation.
1742,1743,Henry IV,44.0,3.1.192,HOTSPUR,"Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!"
1743,1744,Henry IV,44.0,3.1.193,HOTSPUR,"Here come our wives, and let us take our leave."
1744,1745,Henry IV,44.0,,HOTSPUR,Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
1745,1746,Henry IV,45.0,3.1.194,MORTIMER,"This is the deadly spite that angers me,"
1746,1747,Henry IV,45.0,3.1.195,MORTIMER,"My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh."
1747,1748,Henry IV,46.0,3.1.196,GLENDOWER,"My daughter weeps: she will not part with you,"
1748,1749,Henry IV,46.0,3.1.197,GLENDOWER,"She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars."
1749,1750,Henry IV,47.0,3.1.198,MORTIMER,"Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy"
1750,1751,Henry IV,47.0,3.1.199,MORTIMER,Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
1751,1752,Henry IV,47.0,,MORTIMER,"Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same"
1752,1753,Henry IV,48.0,3.1.200,GLENDOWER,"She is desperate here, a peevish self-wind harlotry,"
1753,1754,Henry IV,48.0,3.1.201,GLENDOWER,one that no persuasion can do good upon.
1754,1755,Henry IV,48.0,,GLENDOWER,The lady speaks in Welsh
1755,1756,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.202,MORTIMER,I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
1756,1757,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.203,MORTIMER,Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
1757,1758,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.204,MORTIMER,"I am too perfect in, and, but for shame,"
1758,1759,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.205,MORTIMER,In such a parley should I answer thee.
1759,1760,Henry IV,49.0,,MORTIMER,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1760,1761,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.206,MORTIMER,"I understand thy kisses and thou mine,"
1761,1762,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.207,MORTIMER,And that's a feeling disputation:
1762,1763,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.208,MORTIMER,"But I will never be a truant, love,"
1763,1764,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.209,MORTIMER,"Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue"
1764,1765,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.210,MORTIMER,"Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,"
1765,1766,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.211,MORTIMER,"Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,"
1766,1767,Henry IV,49.0,3.1.212,MORTIMER,"With ravishing division, to her lute."
1767,1768,Henry IV,50.0,3.1.213,GLENDOWER,"Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad."
1768,1769,Henry IV,50.0,,GLENDOWER,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1769,1770,Henry IV,51.0,3.1.214,MORTIMER,"O, I am ignorance itself in this!"
1770,1771,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.215,GLENDOWER,She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
1771,1772,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.216,GLENDOWER,"And rest your gentle head upon her lap,"
1772,1773,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.217,GLENDOWER,And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
1773,1774,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.218,GLENDOWER,And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
1774,1775,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.219,GLENDOWER,"Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,"
1775,1776,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.220,GLENDOWER,Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
1776,1777,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.221,GLENDOWER,As is the difference betwixt day and night
1777,1778,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.222,GLENDOWER,The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
1778,1779,Henry IV,52.0,3.1.223,GLENDOWER,Begins his golden progress in the east.
1779,1780,Henry IV,53.0,3.1.224,MORTIMER,With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
1780,1781,Henry IV,53.0,3.1.225,MORTIMER,"By that time will our book, I think, be drawn"
1781,1782,Henry IV,54.0,3.1.226,GLENDOWER,"Do so,"
1782,1783,Henry IV,54.0,3.1.227,GLENDOWER,And those musicians that shall play to you
1783,1784,Henry IV,54.0,3.1.228,GLENDOWER,"Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,"
1784,1785,Henry IV,54.0,3.1.229,GLENDOWER,"And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend."
1785,1786,Henry IV,55.0,3.1.230,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,"
1786,1787,Henry IV,55.0,3.1.231,HOTSPUR,"quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap."
1787,1788,Henry IV,56.0,3.1.232,LADY PERCY,"Go, ye giddy goose."
1788,1789,Henry IV,56.0,,LADY PERCY,The music plays
1789,1790,Henry IV,57.0,3.1.233,HOTSPUR,"Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,"
1790,1791,Henry IV,57.0,3.1.234,HOTSPUR,And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
1791,1792,Henry IV,57.0,3.1.235,HOTSPUR,"By'r lady, he is a good musician."
1792,1793,Henry IV,58.0,3.1.236,LADY PERCY,Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
1793,1794,Henry IV,58.0,3.1.237,LADY PERCY,"altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,"
1794,1795,Henry IV,58.0,3.1.238,LADY PERCY,and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
1795,1796,Henry IV,59.0,3.1.239,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish."
1796,1797,Henry IV,60.0,3.1.240,LADY PERCY,Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
1797,1798,Henry IV,61.0,3.1.241,HOTSPUR,No.
1798,1799,Henry IV,62.0,3.1.242,LADY PERCY,Then be still.
1799,1800,Henry IV,63.0,3.1.243,HOTSPUR,"Neither,'tis a woman's fault."
1800,1801,Henry IV,64.0,3.1.244,LADY PERCY,Now God help thee!
1801,1802,Henry IV,65.0,3.1.245,HOTSPUR,To the Welsh lady's bed.
1802,1803,Henry IV,66.0,3.1.246,LADY PERCY,What's that?
1803,1804,Henry IV,67.0,3.1.247,HOTSPUR,Peace! she sings.
1804,1805,Henry IV,67.0,,HOTSPUR,Here the lady sings a Welsh song
1805,1806,Henry IV,68.0,3.1.248,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, I'll have your song too."

1809,1810,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.252,HOTSPUR,"'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and"
1810,1811,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.253,HOTSPUR,"'as sure as day,'"
1811,1812,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.254,HOTSPUR,"And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,"
1812,1813,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.255,HOTSPUR,As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
1813,1814,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.256,HOTSPUR,"Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,"
1814,1815,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.257,HOTSPUR,"A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'"
1815,1816,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.258,HOTSPUR,"And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,"
1816,1817,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.259,HOTSPUR,To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
1817,1818,Henry IV,70.0,3.1.260,HOTSPUR,"Come, sing."
1818,1819,Henry IV,71.0,3.1.261,LADY PERCY,I will not sing.
1819,1820,Henry IV,72.0,3.1.262,HOTSPUR,"'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast"

1824,1825,Henry IV,73.0,3.1.266,GLENDOWER,As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
1825,1826,Henry IV,73.0,3.1.267,GLENDOWER,"By this our book is drawn, we'll but seal,"
1826,1827,Henry IV,73.0,3.1.268,GLENDOWER,And then to horse immediately.

1854,1855,Henry IV,2.0,3.2.23,PRINCE HENRY,"As, in reproof of many tales devised,"

1856,1857,Henry IV,2.0,3.2.25,PRINCE HENRY,"By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,"

1865,1866,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.34,KING HENRY IV,And art almost an alien to the hearts
1866,1867,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.35,KING HENRY IV,Of all the court and princes of my blood:
1867,1868,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.36,KING HENRY IV,The hope and expectation of thy time
1868,1869,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.37,KING HENRY IV,"Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man"
1869,1870,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.38,KING HENRY IV,Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.

1871,1872,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.40,KING HENRY IV,"So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,"
1872,1873,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.41,KING HENRY IV,"So stale and cheap to vulgar company,"
1873,1874,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.42,KING HENRY IV,"Opinion, that did help me to the crown,"
1874,1875,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.43,KING HENRY IV,Had still kept loyal to possession
1875,1876,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.44,KING HENRY IV,"And left me in reputeless banishment,"
1876,1877,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.45,KING HENRY IV,A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
1877,1878,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.46,KING HENRY IV,"By being seldom seen, I could not stir"
1878,1879,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.47,KING HENRY IV,"But like a comet I was wonder'd at,"
1879,1880,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.48,KING HENRY IV,"That men would tell their children 'This is he,'"
1880,1881,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.49,KING HENRY IV,"Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'"
1881,1882,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.50,KING HENRY IV,"And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,"
1882,1883,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.51,KING HENRY IV,And dress'd myself in such humility
1883,1884,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.52,KING HENRY IV,"That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,"
1884,1885,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.53,KING HENRY IV,"Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,"
1885,1886,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.54,KING HENRY IV,Even in the presence of the crowned king.
1886,1887,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.55,KING HENRY IV,"Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,"
1887,1888,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.56,KING HENRY IV,"My presence, like a robe pontifical,"
1888,1889,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.57,KING HENRY IV,"Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,"
1889,1890,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.58,KING HENRY IV,"Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast"
1890,1891,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.59,KING HENRY IV,And won by rareness such solemnity.
1891,1892,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.60,KING HENRY IV,"The skipping king, he ambled up and down"
1892,1893,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.61,KING HENRY IV,"With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,"
1893,1894,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.62,KING HENRY IV,"Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,"
1894,1895,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.63,KING HENRY IV,"Mingled his royalty with capering fools,"
1895,1896,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.64,KING HENRY IV,Had his great name profaned with their scorns
1896,1897,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.65,KING HENRY IV,"And gave his countenance, against his name,"
1897,1898,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.66,KING HENRY IV,To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
1898,1899,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.67,KING HENRY IV,"Of every beardless vain comparative,"
1899,1900,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.68,KING HENRY IV,"Grew a companion to the common streets,"
1900,1901,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.69,KING HENRY IV,"Enfeoff'd himself to popularity,"
1901,1902,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.70,KING HENRY IV,"That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,"
1902,1903,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.71,KING HENRY IV,They surfeited with honey and began
1903,1904,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.72,KING HENRY IV,"To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little"
1904,1905,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.73,KING HENRY IV,More than a little is by much too much.
1905,1906,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.74,KING HENRY IV,"So when he had occasion to be seen,"
1906,1907,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.75,KING HENRY IV,"He was but as the cuckoo is in June,"
1907,1908,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.76,KING HENRY IV,"Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes"
1908,1909,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.77,KING HENRY IV,"As, sick and blunted with community,"
1909,1910,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.78,KING HENRY IV,"Afford no extraordinary gaze,"
1910,1911,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.79,KING HENRY IV,Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
1911,1912,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.80,KING HENRY IV,"When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,"
1912,1913,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.81,KING HENRY IV,"But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,"
1913,1914,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.82,KING HENRY IV,Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
1914,1915,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.83,KING HENRY IV,"As cloudy men use to their adversaries,"
1915,1916,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.84,KING HENRY IV,"Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full."
1916,1917,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.85,KING HENRY IV,"And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,"
1917,1918,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.86,KING HENRY IV,For thou has lost thy princely privilege
1918,1919,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.87,KING HENRY IV,With vile participation: not an eye
1919,1920,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.88,KING HENRY IV,"But is a-weary of thy common sight,"
1920,1921,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.89,KING HENRY IV,"Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,"
1921,1922,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.90,KING HENRY IV,"Which now doth that I would not have it do,"
1922,1923,Henry IV,3.0,3.2.91,KING HENRY IV,Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

2119,2120,Henry IV,39.0,3.2.283,PRINCE HENRY,"What didst thou lose, Jack?"
2120,2121,Henry IV,40.0,3.2.284,FALSTAFF,"Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of"
2121,2122,Henry IV,40.0,3.2.285,FALSTAFF,"forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my"
2122,2123,Henry IV,40.0,3.2.286,FALSTAFF,grandfather's.
2123,2124,Henry IV,41.0,3.2.287,PRINCE HENRY,"A trifle, some eight-penny matter."
2124,2125,Henry IV,42.0,3.2.288,Hostess,"So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your"
2125,2126,Henry IV,42.0,3.2.289,Hostess,"grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely"
2126,2127,Henry IV,42.0,3.2.290,Hostess,"of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is, and said"
2127,2128,Henry IV,42.0,3.2.291,Hostess,he would cudgel you.
2128,2129,Henry IV,43.0,3.2.292,PRINCE HENRY,What! he did not?
2129,2130,Henry IV,44.0,3.2.293,Hostess,"There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else."
2130,2131,Henry IV,45.0,3.2.294,FALSTAFF,There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
2131,2132,Henry IV,45.0,3.2.295,FALSTAFF,"prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn"
2132,2133,Henry IV,45.0,3.2.296,FALSTAFF,"fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the"
2133,2134,Henry IV,45.0,3.2.297,FALSTAFF,"deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,"
2134,2135,Henry IV,45.0,3.2.298,FALSTAFF,go
2135,2136,Henry IV,46.0,3.2.299,Hostess,"Say, what thing? what thing?"
2136,2137,Henry IV,47.0,3.2.300,FALSTAFF,"What thing! why, a thing to thank God on."
2137,2138,Henry IV,48.0,3.2.301,Hostess,"I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou"
2138,2139,Henry IV,48.0,3.2.302,Hostess,"shouldst know it, I am an honest man's wife: and,"
2139,2140,Henry IV,48.0,3.2.303,Hostess,"setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to"
2140,2141,Henry IV,48.0,3.2.304,Hostess,call me so.
2141,2142,Henry IV,49.0,3.2.305,FALSTAFF,"Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say"
2142,2143,Henry IV,49.0,3.2.306,FALSTAFF,otherwise.
2143,2144,Henry IV,50.0,3.2.307,Hostess,"Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?"
2144,2145,Henry IV,51.0,3.2.308,FALSTAFF,"What beast! why, an otter."
2145,2146,Henry IV,52.0,3.2.309,PRINCE HENRY,"An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?"
2146,2147,Henry IV,53.0,3.2.310,FALSTAFF,"Why, she's neither fish nor flesh, a man knows not"
2147,2148,Henry IV,53.0,3.2.311,FALSTAFF,where to have her.
2148,2149,Henry IV,54.0,3.2.312,Hostess,Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
2149,2150,Henry IV,54.0,3.2.313,Hostess,"man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!"
2150,2151,Henry IV,55.0,3.2.314,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly."
2151,2152,Henry IV,56.0,3.2.315,Hostess,"So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you"
2152,2153,Henry IV,56.0,3.2.316,Hostess,ought him a thousand pound.
2153,2154,Henry IV,57.0,3.2.317,PRINCE HENRY,"Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?"
2154,2155,Henry IV,58.0,3.2.318,FALSTAFF,"A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth"
2155,2156,Henry IV,58.0,3.2.319,FALSTAFF,a million: thou owest me thy love.
2156,2157,Henry IV,59.0,3.2.320,Hostess,"Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would"
2157,2158,Henry IV,59.0,3.2.321,Hostess,cudgel you.
2158,2159,Henry IV,60.0,3.2.322,FALSTAFF,"Did I, Bardolph?"
2159,2160,Henry IV,61.0,3.2.323,BARDOLPH,"Indeed, Sir John, you said so."
2160,2161,Henry IV,62.0,3.2.324,FALSTAFF,"Yea, if he said my ring was copper."
2161,2162,Henry IV,63.0,3.2.325,PRINCE HENRY,I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
2162,2163,Henry IV,64.0,3.2.326,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:"
2163,2164,Henry IV,64.0,3.2.327,FALSTAFF,"but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the"

2165,2166,Henry IV,65.0,3.2.329,PRINCE HENRY,And why not as the lion?
2166,2167,Henry IV,66.0,3.2.330,FALSTAFF,The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
2167,2168,Henry IV,66.0,3.2.331,FALSTAFF,"think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an"
2168,2169,Henry IV,66.0,3.2.332,FALSTAFF,"I do, I pray God my girdle break."
2169,2170,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.333,PRINCE HENRY,"O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy"
2170,2171,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.334,PRINCE HENRY,"knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,"
2171,2172,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.335,PRINCE HENRY,"truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine, it is all"
2172,2173,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.336,PRINCE HENRY,filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest

2174,2175,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.338,PRINCE HENRY,"impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in"
2175,2176,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.339,PRINCE HENRY,"thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of"

2179,2180,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.343,PRINCE HENRY,"am a villain: and yet you will stand to if, you will"
2180,2181,Henry IV,67.0,3.2.344,PRINCE HENRY,not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
2181,2182,Henry IV,68.0,3.2.345,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of"
2182,2183,Henry IV,68.0,3.2.346,FALSTAFF,"innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack"
2183,2184,Henry IV,68.0,3.2.347,FALSTAFF,Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
2184,2185,Henry IV,68.0,3.2.348,FALSTAFF,"have more flesh than another man, and therefore more"
2185,2186,Henry IV,68.0,3.2.349,FALSTAFF,"frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?"
2186,2187,Henry IV,69.0,3.2.350,PRINCE HENRY,It appears so by the story.
2187,2188,Henry IV,70.0,3.2.351,FALSTAFF,"Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast,"
2188,2189,Henry IV,70.0,3.2.352,FALSTAFF,"love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy"
2189,2190,Henry IV,70.0,3.2.353,FALSTAFF,guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest

2191,2192,Henry IV,70.0,3.2.355,FALSTAFF,"prithee, be gone."
2192,2193,Henry IV,70.0,,FALSTAFF,Exit Hostess
2193,2194,Henry IV,70.0,3.2.356,FALSTAFF,"Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,"
2194,2195,Henry IV,70.0,3.2.357,FALSTAFF,"lad, how is that answered?"
2195,2196,Henry IV,71.0,3.2.358,PRINCE HENRY,"O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to"
2196,2197,Henry IV,71.0,3.2.359,PRINCE HENRY,thee: the money is paid back again.
2197,2198,Henry IV,72.0,3.2.360,FALSTAFF,"O, I do not like that paying back, 'tis a double labour."
2198,2199,Henry IV,73.0,3.2.361,PRINCE HENRY,I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
2199,2200,Henry IV,74.0,3.2.362,FALSTAFF,"Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and"
2200,2201,Henry IV,74.0,3.2.363,FALSTAFF,do it with unwashed hands too.
2201,2202,Henry IV,75.0,3.2.364,BARDOLPH,"Do, my lord."
2202,2203,Henry IV,76.0,3.2.365,PRINCE HENRY,"I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot."
2203,2204,Henry IV,77.0,3.2.366,FALSTAFF,I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
2204,2205,Henry IV,77.0,3.2.367,FALSTAFF,"one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the"
2205,2206,Henry IV,77.0,3.2.368,FALSTAFF,age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
2206,2207,Henry IV,77.0,3.2.369,FALSTAFF,"heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for"
2207,2208,Henry IV,77.0,3.2.370,FALSTAFF,"these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I"

2231,2232,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.2,HOTSPUR,"In this fine age were not thought flattery,"
2232,2233,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.3,HOTSPUR,"Such attribution should the Douglas have,"
2233,2234,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.4,HOTSPUR,As not a soldier of this season's stamp
2234,2235,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.5,HOTSPUR,Should go so general current through the world.
2235,2236,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.6,HOTSPUR,"By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy"
2236,2237,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.7,HOTSPUR,"The tongues of soothers, but a braver place"
2237,2238,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.8,HOTSPUR,In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
2238,2239,Henry IV,1.0,4.1.9,HOTSPUR,"Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord."
2239,2240,Henry IV,2.0,4.1.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Thou art the king of honour:

2241,2242,Henry IV,2.0,4.1.12,EARL OF DOUGLAS,But I will beard him.
2242,2243,Henry IV,3.0,4.1.13,HOTSPUR,"Do so, and 'tis well."
2243,2244,Henry IV,3.0,,HOTSPUR,Enter a Messenger with letters
2244,2245,Henry IV,3.0,4.1.14,HOTSPUR,What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
2245,2246,Henry IV,4.0,4.1.15,Messenger,These letters come from your father.
2246,2247,Henry IV,5.0,4.1.16,HOTSPUR,Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
2247,2248,Henry IV,6.0,4.1.17,Messenger,"He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick."
2248,2249,Henry IV,7.0,4.1.18,HOTSPUR,'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
2249,2250,Henry IV,7.0,4.1.19,HOTSPUR,In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
2250,2251,Henry IV,7.0,4.1.20,HOTSPUR,Under whose government come they along?
2251,2252,Henry IV,8.0,4.1.21,Messenger,"His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord."
2252,2253,Henry IV,9.0,4.1.22,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?"
2253,2254,Henry IV,10.0,4.1.23,Messenger,"He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,"
2254,2255,Henry IV,10.0,4.1.24,Messenger,And at the time of my departure thence
2255,2256,Henry IV,10.0,4.1.25,Messenger,He was much fear'd by his physicians.
2256,2257,Henry IV,11.0,4.1.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,I would the state of time had first been whole
2257,2258,Henry IV,11.0,4.1.27,EARL OF WORCESTER,Ere he by sickness had been visited:
2258,2259,Henry IV,11.0,4.1.28,EARL OF WORCESTER,His health was never better worth than now.
2259,2260,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.29,HOTSPUR,Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
2260,2261,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.30,HOTSPUR,"The very life-blood of our enterprise,"
2261,2262,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.31,HOTSPUR,"'Tis catching hither, even to our camp."

2263,2264,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.33,HOTSPUR,And that his friends by deputation could not
2264,2265,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.34,HOTSPUR,"So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet"
2265,2266,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.35,HOTSPUR,To lay so dangerous and dear a trust

2267,2268,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.37,HOTSPUR,"Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,"
2268,2269,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.38,HOTSPUR,"That with our small conjunction we should on,"
2269,2270,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.39,HOTSPUR,"To see how fortune is disposed to us,"
2270,2271,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.40,HOTSPUR,"For, as he writes, there is no quailing now."
2271,2272,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.41,HOTSPUR,Because the king is certainly possess'd
2272,2273,Henry IV,12.0,4.1.42,HOTSPUR,Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
2273,2274,Henry IV,13.0,4.1.43,EARL OF WORCESTER,Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
2274,2275,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.44,HOTSPUR,"A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:"
2275,2276,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.45,HOTSPUR,"And yet, in faith, it is not, his present want"
2276,2277,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.46,HOTSPUR,Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
2277,2278,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.47,HOTSPUR,To set the exact wealth of all our states
2278,2279,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.48,HOTSPUR,All at one cast? to set so rich a main
2279,2280,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.49,HOTSPUR,On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
2280,2281,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.50,HOTSPUR,"It were not good, for therein should we read"
2281,2282,Henry IV,14.0,4.1.51,HOTSPUR,"The very bottom and the soul of hope,"

2287,2288,Henry IV,15.0,4.1.57,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Is to come in:
2288,2289,Henry IV,15.0,4.1.58,EARL OF DOUGLAS,A comfort of retirement lives in this.
2289,2290,Henry IV,16.0,4.1.59,HOTSPUR,"A rendezvous, a home to fly unto."
2290,2291,Henry IV,16.0,4.1.60,HOTSPUR,If that the devil and mischance look big
2291,2292,Henry IV,16.0,4.1.61,HOTSPUR,Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
2292,2293,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.62,EARL OF WORCESTER,But yet I would your father had been here.
2293,2294,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.63,EARL OF WORCESTER,The quality and hair of our attempt
2294,2295,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.64,EARL OF WORCESTER,Brooks no division: it will be thought

2296,2297,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.66,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike"
2297,2298,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.67,EARL OF WORCESTER,Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
2298,2299,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.68,EARL OF WORCESTER,And think how such an apprehension
2299,2300,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.69,EARL OF WORCESTER,May turn the tide of fearful faction
2300,2301,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.70,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And breed a kind of question in our cause,"
2301,2302,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.71,EARL OF WORCESTER,For well you know we of the offering side
2302,2303,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.72,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,"
2303,2304,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.73,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence"
2304,2305,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.74,EARL OF WORCESTER,The eye of reason may pry in upon us:

2306,2307,Henry IV,17.0,4.1.76,EARL OF WORCESTER,That shows the ignorant a kind of fear

2308,2309,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.78,HOTSPUR,You strain too far.
2309,2310,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.79,HOTSPUR,I rather of his absence make this use:
2310,2311,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.80,HOTSPUR,"It lends a lustre and more great opinion,"
2311,2312,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.81,HOTSPUR,"A larger dare to our great enterprise,"
2312,2313,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.82,HOTSPUR,"Than if the earl were here, for men must think,"
2313,2314,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.83,HOTSPUR,If we without his help can make a head
2314,2315,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.84,HOTSPUR,"To push against a kingdom, with his help"
2315,2316,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.85,HOTSPUR,We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
2316,2317,Henry IV,18.0,4.1.86,HOTSPUR,"Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole."
2317,2318,Henry IV,19.0,4.1.87,EARL OF DOUGLAS,As heart can think: there is not such a word
2318,2319,Henry IV,19.0,4.1.88,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
2319,2320,Henry IV,19.0,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
2320,2321,Henry IV,20.0,4.1.89,HOTSPUR,"My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul."

2331,2332,Henry IV,24.0,4.1.100,HOTSPUR,"And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,"
2332,2333,Henry IV,24.0,4.1.101,HOTSPUR,And bid it pass?
2333,2334,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.102,VERNON,"All furnish'd, all in arms,"
2334,2335,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.103,VERNON,All plumed like estridges that with the wind

2339,2340,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.108,VERNON,"Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls."
2340,2341,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.109,VERNON,"I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,"
2341,2342,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.110,VERNON,"His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd"
2342,2343,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.111,VERNON,"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,"
2343,2344,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.112,VERNON,"And vaulted with such ease into his seat,"
2344,2345,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.113,VERNON,"As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,"
2345,2346,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.114,VERNON,To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
2346,2347,Henry IV,25.0,4.1.115,VERNON,And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
2347,2348,Henry IV,26.0,4.1.116,HOTSPUR,"No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,"
2348,2349,Henry IV,26.0,4.1.117,HOTSPUR,This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
2349,2350,Henry IV,26.0,4.1.118,HOTSPUR,"They come like sacrifices in their trim,"
2350,2351,Henry IV,26.0,4.1.119,HOTSPUR,And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war

2360,2361,Henry IV,26.0,4.1.129,HOTSPUR,O that Glendower were come!
2361,2362,Henry IV,27.0,4.1.130,VERNON,There is more news:

2363,2364,Henry IV,27.0,4.1.132,VERNON,He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
2364,2365,Henry IV,28.0,4.1.133,EARL OF DOUGLAS,That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
2365,2366,Henry IV,29.0,4.1.134,WORCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound."
2366,2367,Henry IV,30.0,4.1.135,HOTSPUR,What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
2367,2368,Henry IV,31.0,4.1.136,VERNON,To thirty thousand.
2368,2369,Henry IV,32.0,4.1.137,HOTSPUR,Forty let it be:
2369,2370,Henry IV,32.0,4.1.138,HOTSPUR,"My father and Glendower being both away,"
2370,2371,Henry IV,32.0,4.1.139,HOTSPUR,The powers of us may serve so great a day

2373,2374,Henry IV,33.0,4.1.142,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Talk not of dying: I am out of fear

2383,2384,Henry IV,4.0,4.2.6,BARDOLPH,This bottle makes an angel.
2384,2385,Henry IV,5.0,4.2.7,FALSTAFF,"An if it do, take it for thy labour, and if it make"
2385,2386,Henry IV,5.0,4.2.8,FALSTAFF,"twenty, take them all, I'll answer the coinage. Bid"
2386,2387,Henry IV,5.0,4.2.9,FALSTAFF,my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
2387,2388,Henry IV,6.0,4.2.10,BARDOLPH,"I will, captain: farewell."
2388,2389,Henry IV,6.0,,BARDOLPH,Exit

2392,2393,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.14,FALSTAFF,"soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me"

2398,2399,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.20,FALSTAFF,fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such

2400,2401,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.22,FALSTAFF,"bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out"

2402,2403,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.24,FALSTAFF,"ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of"
2403,2404,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.25,FALSTAFF,"companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the"

2411,2412,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.33,FALSTAFF,the rooms of them that have bought out their
2412,2413,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.34,FALSTAFF,"services, that you would think that I had a hundred"

2414,2415,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.36,FALSTAFF,"swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad"
2415,2416,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.37,FALSTAFF,fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
2416,2417,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.38,FALSTAFF,all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
2417,2418,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.39,FALSTAFF,hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
2418,2419,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.40,FALSTAFF,"Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the"
2419,2420,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.41,FALSTAFF,"villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had"
2420,2421,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.42,FALSTAFF,"gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of"
2421,2422,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.43,FALSTAFF,prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
2422,2423,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.44,FALSTAFF,"company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked"
2423,2424,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.45,FALSTAFF,together and thrown over the shoulders like an
2424,2425,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.46,FALSTAFF,"herald's coat without sleeves, and the shirt, to say"
2425,2426,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.47,FALSTAFF,"the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or"
2426,2427,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.48,FALSTAFF,the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
2427,2428,Henry IV,7.0,4.2.49,FALSTAFF,"one, they'll find linen enough on every hedge."
2428,2429,Henry IV,7.0,,FALSTAFF,Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND

2433,2434,Henry IV,9.0,4.2.54,FALSTAFF,at Shrewsbury.
2434,2435,Henry IV,10.0,4.2.55,WESTMORELAND,"Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were"

2436,2437,Henry IV,10.0,4.2.57,WESTMORELAND,"The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must"
2437,2438,Henry IV,10.0,4.2.58,WESTMORELAND,away all night.
2438,2439,Henry IV,11.0,4.2.59,FALSTAFF,"Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to"
2439,2440,Henry IV,11.0,4.2.60,FALSTAFF,steal cream.
2440,2441,Henry IV,12.0,4.2.61,PRINCE HENRY,"I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath"
2441,2442,Henry IV,12.0,4.2.62,PRINCE HENRY,"already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose"

2443,2444,Henry IV,13.0,4.2.64,FALSTAFF,"Mine, Hal, mine."
2444,2445,Henry IV,14.0,4.2.65,PRINCE HENRY,I did never see such pitiful rascals.
2445,2446,Henry IV,15.0,4.2.66,FALSTAFF,"Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food"
2446,2447,Henry IV,15.0,4.2.67,FALSTAFF,"for powder, they'll fill a pit as well as better:"
2447,2448,Henry IV,15.0,4.2.68,FALSTAFF,"tush, man, mortal men, mortal men."
2448,2449,Henry IV,16.0,4.2.69,WESTMORELAND,"Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor"
2449,2450,Henry IV,16.0,4.2.70,WESTMORELAND,"and bare, too beggarly."
2450,2451,Henry IV,17.0,4.2.71,FALSTAFF,"'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had"
2451,2452,Henry IV,17.0,4.2.72,FALSTAFF,"that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never"
2452,2453,Henry IV,17.0,4.2.73,FALSTAFF,learned that of me.
2453,2454,Henry IV,18.0,4.2.74,PRINCE HENRY,"No I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on"
2454,2455,Henry IV,18.0,4.2.75,PRINCE HENRY,"the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is"
2455,2456,Henry IV,18.0,4.2.76,PRINCE HENRY,already in the field.
2456,2457,Henry IV,19.0,4.2.77,FALSTAFF,"What, is the king encamped?"
2457,2458,Henry IV,20.0,4.2.78,WESTMORELAND,"He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long."
2458,2459,Henry IV,21.0,4.2.79,FALSTAFF,"Well,"
2459,2460,Henry IV,21.0,4.2.80,FALSTAFF,To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast

2467,2468,Henry IV,4.0,4.3.4,VERNON,Not a whit.
2468,2469,Henry IV,5.0,4.3.5,HOTSPUR,Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
2469,2470,Henry IV,6.0,4.3.6,VERNON,So do we.
2470,2471,Henry IV,7.0,4.3.7,HOTSPUR,"His is certain, ours is doubtful."

2504,2505,Henry IV,19.0,4.3.39,HOTSPUR,You were of our determination!
2505,2506,Henry IV,19.0,4.3.40,HOTSPUR,"Some of us love you well, and even those some"
2506,2507,Henry IV,19.0,4.3.41,HOTSPUR,"Envy your great deservings and good name,"
2507,2508,Henry IV,19.0,4.3.42,HOTSPUR,"Because you are not of our quality,"
2508,2509,Henry IV,19.0,4.3.43,HOTSPUR,But stand against us like an enemy.
2509,2510,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.44,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"And God defend but still I should stand so,"
2510,2511,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.45,SIR WALTER BLUNT,So long as out of limit and true rule
2511,2512,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.46,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You stand against anointed majesty.
2512,2513,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.47,SIR WALTER BLUNT,But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
2513,2514,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.48,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The nature of your griefs, and whereupon"
2514,2515,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.49,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You conjure from the breast of civil peace
2515,2516,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.50,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land"
2516,2517,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.51,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Audacious cruelty. If that the king
2517,2518,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.52,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Have any way your good deserts forgot,"
2518,2519,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.53,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Which he confesseth to be manifold,"
2519,2520,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.54,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed"
2520,2521,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.55,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You shall have your desires with interest
2521,2522,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.56,SIR WALTER BLUNT,And pardon absolute for yourself and these
2522,2523,Henry IV,20.0,4.3.57,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Herein misled by your suggestion.
2523,2524,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.58,HOTSPUR,"The king is kind, and well we know the king"
2524,2525,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.59,HOTSPUR,"Knows at what time to promise, when to pay."
2525,2526,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.60,HOTSPUR,My father and my uncle and myself
2526,2527,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.61,HOTSPUR,"Did give him that same royalty he wears,"
2527,2528,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.62,HOTSPUR,"And when he was not six and twenty strong,"
2528,2529,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.63,HOTSPUR,"Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,"
2529,2530,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.64,HOTSPUR,"A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,"
2530,2531,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.65,HOTSPUR,"My father gave him welcome to the shore,"
2531,2532,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.66,HOTSPUR,And when he heard him swear and vow to God
2532,2533,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.67,HOTSPUR,"He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,"
2533,2534,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.68,HOTSPUR,"To sue his livery and beg his peace,"
2534,2535,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.69,HOTSPUR,"With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,"
2535,2536,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.70,HOTSPUR,"My father, in kind heart and pity moved,"
2536,2537,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.71,HOTSPUR,Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
2537,2538,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.72,HOTSPUR,Now when the lords and barons of the realm
2538,2539,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.73,HOTSPUR,"Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,"
2539,2540,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.74,HOTSPUR,"The more and less came in with cap and knee,"
2540,2541,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.75,HOTSPUR,"Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,"
2541,2542,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.76,HOTSPUR,"Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,"
2542,2543,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.77,HOTSPUR,"Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,"
2543,2544,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.78,HOTSPUR,"Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him"
2544,2545,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.79,HOTSPUR,Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
2545,2546,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.80,HOTSPUR,"He presently, as greatness knows itself,"
2546,2547,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.81,HOTSPUR,Steps me a little higher than his vow
2547,2548,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.82,HOTSPUR,"Made to my father, while his blood was poor,"
2548,2549,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.83,HOTSPUR,"Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,"
2549,2550,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.84,HOTSPUR,"And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform"
2550,2551,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.85,HOTSPUR,Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
2551,2552,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.86,HOTSPUR,"That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,"
2552,2553,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.87,HOTSPUR,"Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep"
2553,2554,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.88,HOTSPUR,"Over his country's wrongs, and by this face,"
2554,2555,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.89,HOTSPUR,"This seeming brow of justice, did he win"
2555,2556,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.90,HOTSPUR,"The hearts of all that he did angle for,"
2556,2557,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.91,HOTSPUR,"Proceeded further, cut me off the heads"
2557,2558,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.92,HOTSPUR,Of all the favourites that the absent king
2558,2559,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.93,HOTSPUR,"In deputation left behind him here,"
2559,2560,Henry IV,21.0,4.3.94,HOTSPUR,When he was personal in the Irish war.
2560,2561,Henry IV,22.0,4.3.95,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Tut, I came not to hear this."
2561,2562,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.96,HOTSPUR,Then to the point.
2562,2563,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.97,HOTSPUR,"In short time after, he deposed the king,"
2563,2564,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.98,HOTSPUR,"Soon after that, deprived him of his life,"
2564,2565,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.99,HOTSPUR,"And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:"
2565,2566,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.100,HOTSPUR,"To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,"
2566,2567,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.101,HOTSPUR,"Who is, if every owner were well placed,"
2567,2568,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.102,HOTSPUR,"Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,"
2568,2569,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.103,HOTSPUR,"There without ransom to lie forfeited,"
2569,2570,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.104,HOTSPUR,"Disgraced me in my happy victories,"
2570,2571,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.105,HOTSPUR,"Sought to entrap me by intelligence,"
2571,2572,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.106,HOTSPUR,"Rated mine uncle from the council-board,"
2572,2573,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.107,HOTSPUR,"In rage dismiss'd my father from the court,"
2573,2574,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.108,HOTSPUR,"Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,"
2574,2575,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.109,HOTSPUR,And in conclusion drove us to seek out
2575,2576,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.110,HOTSPUR,"This head of safety, and withal to pry"
2576,2577,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.111,HOTSPUR,"Into his title, the which we find"
2577,2578,Henry IV,23.0,4.3.112,HOTSPUR,Too indirect for long continuance.
2578,2579,Henry IV,24.0,4.3.113,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Shall I return this answer to the king?
2579,2580,Henry IV,25.0,4.3.114,HOTSPUR,"Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile."
2580,2581,Henry IV,25.0,4.3.115,HOTSPUR,"Go to the king, and let there be impawn'd"
2581,2582,Henry IV,25.0,4.3.116,HOTSPUR,"Some surety for a safe return again,"
2582,2583,Henry IV,25.0,4.3.117,HOTSPUR,And in the morning early shall my uncle
2583,2584,Henry IV,25.0,4.3.118,HOTSPUR,Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
2584,2585,Henry IV,26.0,4.3.119,SIR WALTER BLUNT,I would you would accept of grace and love.
2585,2586,Henry IV,27.0,4.3.120,HOTSPUR,And may be so we shall.
2586,2587,Henry IV,28.0,4.3.121,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Pray God you do.
2587,2588,Henry IV,28.0,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Exeunt
2588,2589,Henry IV,28.0,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.
2589,2590,Henry IV,28.0,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
2590,2591,Henry IV,1.0,4.4.1,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief"
2591,2592,Henry IV,1.0,4.4.2,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"With winged haste to the lord marshal,"
2592,2593,Henry IV,1.0,4.4.3,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest"
2593,2594,Henry IV,1.0,4.4.4,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To whom they are directed. If you knew
2594,2595,Henry IV,1.0,4.4.5,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"How much they do to import, you would make haste."
2595,2596,Henry IV,2.0,4.4.6,SIR MICHAEL,"My good lord,"
2596,2597,Henry IV,2.0,4.4.7,SIR MICHAEL,I guess their tenor.
2597,2598,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.8,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Like enough you do.
2598,2599,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.9,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day"
2599,2600,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.10,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
2600,2601,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.11,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Must bide the touch, for, sir, at Shrewsbury,"
2601,2602,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.12,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"As I am truly given to understand,"
2602,2603,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.13,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The king with mighty and quick-raised power
2603,2604,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.14,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,"
2604,2605,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.15,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"What with the sickness of Northumberland,"
2605,2606,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.16,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Whose power was in the first proportion,"
2606,2607,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.17,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,"
2607,2608,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.18,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Who with them was a rated sinew too
2608,2609,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.19,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,"
2609,2610,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.20,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I fear the power of Percy is too weak
2610,2611,Henry IV,3.0,4.4.21,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To wage an instant trial with the king.
2611,2612,Henry IV,4.0,4.4.22,SIR MICHAEL,"Why, my good lord, you need not fear,"
2612,2613,Henry IV,4.0,4.4.23,SIR MICHAEL,There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
2613,2614,Henry IV,5.0,4.4.24,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"No, Mortimer is not there."
2614,2615,Henry IV,6.0,4.4.25,SIR MICHAEL,"But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,"
2615,2616,Henry IV,6.0,4.4.26,SIR MICHAEL,And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
2616,2617,Henry IV,6.0,4.4.27,SIR MICHAEL,"Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen."
2617,2618,Henry IV,7.0,4.4.28,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
2618,2619,Henry IV,7.0,4.4.29,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The special head of all the land together:
2619,2620,Henry IV,7.0,4.4.30,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,"
2620,2621,Henry IV,7.0,4.4.31,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt,"
2621,2622,Henry IV,7.0,4.4.32,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And moe corrivals and dear men
2622,2623,Henry IV,7.0,4.4.33,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Of estimation and command in arms.
2623,2624,Henry IV,8.0,4.4.34,SIR MICHAEL,"Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed."
2624,2625,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.35,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear,"
2625,2626,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.36,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:"
2626,2627,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.37,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king"
2627,2628,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.38,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,"
2628,2629,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.39,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For he hath heard of our confederacy,"
2629,2630,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.40,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
2630,2631,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.41,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Therefore make haste. I must go write again
2631,2632,Henry IV,9.0,4.4.42,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To other friends, and so farewell, Sir Michael."
2632,2633,Henry IV,9.0,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Exeunt

2634,2635,Henry IV,9.0,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.
2635,2636,Henry IV,9.0,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF"
2636,2637,Henry IV,1.0,5.1.1,KING HENRY IV,How bloodily the sun begins to peer
2637,2638,Henry IV,1.0,5.1.2,KING HENRY IV,Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
2638,2639,Henry IV,1.0,5.1.3,KING HENRY IV,At his distemperature.
2639,2640,Henry IV,2.0,5.1.4,PRINCE HENRY,The southern wind
2640,2641,Henry IV,2.0,5.1.5,PRINCE HENRY,"Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,"
2641,2642,Henry IV,2.0,5.1.6,PRINCE HENRY,And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
2642,2643,Henry IV,2.0,5.1.7,PRINCE HENRY,Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
2643,2644,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.8,KING HENRY IV,"Then with the losers let it sympathize,"
2644,2645,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.9,KING HENRY IV,For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
2645,2646,Henry IV,3.0,,KING HENRY IV,The trumpet sounds
2646,2647,Henry IV,3.0,,KING HENRY IV,Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
2647,2648,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.10,KING HENRY IV,"How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well"
2648,2649,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.11,KING HENRY IV,That you and I should meet upon such terms
2649,2650,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.12,KING HENRY IV,"As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,"
2650,2651,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.13,KING HENRY IV,"And made us doff our easy robes of peace,"
2651,2652,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.14,KING HENRY IV,To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
2652,2653,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.15,KING HENRY IV,"This is not well, my lord, this is not well."
2653,2654,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.16,KING HENRY IV,What say you to it? will you again unknit
2654,2655,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.17,KING HENRY IV,This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
2655,2656,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.18,KING HENRY IV,And move in that obedient orb again
2656,2657,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.19,KING HENRY IV,"Where you did give a fair and natural light,"
2657,2658,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.20,KING HENRY IV,"And be no more an exhaled meteor,"
2658,2659,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.21,KING HENRY IV,A prodigy of fear and a portent
2659,2660,Henry IV,3.0,5.1.22,KING HENRY IV,Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
2660,2661,Henry IV,4.0,5.1.23,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Hear me, my liege:"
2661,2662,Henry IV,4.0,5.1.24,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For mine own part, I could be well content"
2662,2663,Henry IV,4.0,5.1.25,EARL OF WORCESTER,To entertain the lag-end of my life
2663,2664,Henry IV,4.0,5.1.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,"With quiet hours, for I do protest,"
2664,2665,Henry IV,4.0,5.1.27,EARL OF WORCESTER,I have not sought the day of this dislike.
2665,2666,Henry IV,5.0,5.1.28,KING HENRY IV,"You have not sought it! how comes it, then?"
2666,2667,Henry IV,6.0,5.1.29,FALSTAFF,"Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it."
2667,2668,Henry IV,7.0,5.1.30,PRINCE HENRY,"Peace, chewet, peace!"
2668,2669,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.31,EARL OF WORCESTER,It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
2669,2670,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.32,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of favour from myself and all our house,"
2670,2671,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.33,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And yet I must remember you, my lord,"
2671,2672,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.34,EARL OF WORCESTER,We were the first and dearest of your friends.
2672,2673,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.35,EARL OF WORCESTER,For you my staff of office did I break
2673,2674,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.36,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In Richard's time, and posted day and night"
2674,2675,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.37,EARL OF WORCESTER,"to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,"
2675,2676,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.38,EARL OF WORCESTER,When yet you were in place and in account
2676,2677,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.39,EARL OF WORCESTER,Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
2677,2678,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.40,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It was myself, my brother and his son,"
2678,2679,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.41,EARL OF WORCESTER,That brought you home and boldly did outdare
2679,2680,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.42,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The dangers of the time. You swore to us,"
2680,2681,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.43,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,"
2681,2682,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.44,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,"
2682,2683,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.45,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,"
2683,2684,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.46,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:"
2684,2685,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.47,EARL OF WORCESTER,To this we swore our aid. But in short space
2685,2686,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.48,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It rain'd down fortune showering on your head,"
2686,2687,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.49,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And such a flood of greatness fell on you,"
2687,2688,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.50,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with our help, what with the absent king,"
2688,2689,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.51,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with the injuries of a wanton time,"
2689,2690,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.52,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seeming sufferances that you had borne,"
2690,2691,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.53,EARL OF WORCESTER,And the contrarious winds that held the king
2691,2692,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.54,EARL OF WORCESTER,So long in his unlucky Irish wars
2692,2693,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.55,EARL OF WORCESTER,That all in England did repute him dead:
2693,2694,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.56,EARL OF WORCESTER,And from this swarm of fair advantages
2694,2695,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.57,EARL OF WORCESTER,You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
2695,2696,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.58,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To gripe the general sway into your hand,"
2696,2697,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.59,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Forget your oath to us at Doncaster,"
2697,2698,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.60,EARL OF WORCESTER,And being fed by us you used us so
2698,2699,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.61,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,"
2699,2700,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.62,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Useth the sparrow, did oppress our nest,"
2700,2701,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.63,EARL OF WORCESTER,Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
2701,2702,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.64,EARL OF WORCESTER,That even our love durst not come near your sight
2702,2703,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.65,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For fear of swallowing, but with nimble wing"
2703,2704,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.66,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly"
2704,2705,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.67,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Out of sight and raise this present head,"

2706,2707,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.69,EARL OF WORCESTER,As you yourself have forged against yourself
2707,2708,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.70,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,"
2708,2709,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.71,EARL OF WORCESTER,And violation of all faith and troth
2709,2710,Henry IV,8.0,5.1.72,EARL OF WORCESTER,Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
2710,2711,Henry IV,9.0,5.1.73,KING HENRY IV,"These things indeed you have articulate,"
2711,2712,Henry IV,9.0,5.1.74,KING HENRY IV,"Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,"

2716,2717,Henry IV,9.0,5.1.79,KING HENRY IV,Of hurlyburly innovation:
2717,2718,Henry IV,9.0,5.1.80,KING HENRY IV,And never yet did insurrection want
2718,2719,Henry IV,9.0,5.1.81,KING HENRY IV,"Such water-colours to impaint his cause,"

2722,2723,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.85,PRINCE HENRY,"Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,"

2728,2729,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.91,PRINCE HENRY,"More active-valiant or more valiant-young,"
2729,2730,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.92,PRINCE HENRY,"More daring or more bold, is now alive"
2730,2731,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.93,PRINCE HENRY,To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
2731,2732,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.94,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, I may speak it to my shame,"
2732,2733,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.95,PRINCE HENRY,"I have a truant been to chivalry,"
2733,2734,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.96,PRINCE HENRY,"And so I hear he doth account me too,"
2734,2735,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.97,PRINCE HENRY,Yet this before my father's majesty--
2735,2736,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.98,PRINCE HENRY,I am content that he shall take the odds
2736,2737,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.99,PRINCE HENRY,"Of his great name and estimation,"
2737,2738,Henry IV,10.0,5.1.100,PRINCE HENRY,"And will, to save the blood on either side,"

2741,2742,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.104,KING HENRY IV,"Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,"
2742,2743,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.105,KING HENRY IV,"We love our people well, even those we love"
2743,2744,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.106,KING HENRY IV,"That are misled upon your cousin's part,"

2745,2746,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.108,KING HENRY IV,"Both he and they and you, every man"
2746,2747,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.109,KING HENRY IV,Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
2747,2748,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.110,KING HENRY IV,"So tell your cousin, and bring me word"
2748,2749,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.111,KING HENRY IV,"What he will do: but if he will not yield,"
2749,2750,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.112,KING HENRY IV,Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
2750,2751,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.113,KING HENRY IV,"And they shall do their office. So, be gone,"
2751,2752,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.114,KING HENRY IV,We will not now be troubled with reply:
2752,2753,Henry IV,11.0,5.1.115,KING HENRY IV,"We offer fair, take it advisedly."

2756,2757,Henry IV,12.0,5.1.118,PRINCE HENRY,Are confident against the world in arms.

2758,2759,Henry IV,13.0,5.1.120,KING HENRY IV,"For, on their answer, will we set on them:"
2759,2760,Henry IV,13.0,5.1.121,KING HENRY IV,"And God befriend us, as our cause is just!"

2769,2770,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.129,FALSTAFF,his day. What need I be so forward with him that
2770,2771,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.130,FALSTAFF,"calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter, honour pricks"
2771,2772,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.131,FALSTAFF,"me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I"
2772,2773,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.132,FALSTAFF,come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
2773,2774,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.133,FALSTAFF,an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
2774,2775,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.134,FALSTAFF,"Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is"
2775,2776,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.135,FALSTAFF,honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
2776,2777,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.136,FALSTAFF,is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
2777,2778,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.137,FALSTAFF,he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
2778,2779,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.138,FALSTAFF,"Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,"
2779,2780,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.139,FALSTAFF,to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
2780,2781,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.140,FALSTAFF,no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
2781,2782,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.141,FALSTAFF,I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
2782,2783,Henry IV,18.0,5.1.142,FALSTAFF,ends my catechism.

2853,2854,Henry IV,16.0,5.2.65,VERNON,As if he master'd there a double spirit.
2854,2855,Henry IV,16.0,5.2.66,VERNON,Of teaching and of learning instantly.

2873,2874,Henry IV,19.0,5.2.84,HOTSPUR,"To spend that shortness basely were too long,"
2874,2875,Henry IV,19.0,5.2.85,HOTSPUR,"If life did ride upon a dial's point,"
2875,2876,Henry IV,19.0,5.2.86,HOTSPUR,Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
2876,2877,Henry IV,19.0,5.2.87,HOTSPUR,"An if we live, we live to tread on kings,"

2884,2885,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.94,HOTSPUR,Let each man do his best: and here draw I
2885,2886,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.95,HOTSPUR,"A sword, whose temper I intend to stain"
2886,2887,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.96,HOTSPUR,With the best blood that I can meet withal
2887,2888,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.97,HOTSPUR,In the adventure of this perilous day.
2888,2889,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.98,HOTSPUR,"Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on."
2889,2890,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.99,HOTSPUR,"Sound all the lofty instruments of war,"
2890,2891,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.100,HOTSPUR,"And by that music let us all embrace,"
2891,2892,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.101,HOTSPUR,"For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall"
2892,2893,Henry IV,21.0,5.2.102,HOTSPUR,A second time do such a courtesy.
2893,2894,Henry IV,21.0,,HOTSPUR,"The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt"

2897,2898,Henry IV,1.0,5.3.2,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
2898,2899,Henry IV,1.0,5.3.3,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Upon my head?
2899,2900,Henry IV,2.0,5.3.4,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Know then, my name is Douglas,"
2900,2901,Henry IV,2.0,5.3.5,EARL OF DOUGLAS,And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
2901,2902,Henry IV,2.0,5.3.6,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Because some tell me that thou art a king.
2902,2903,Henry IV,3.0,5.3.7,SIR WALTER BLUNT,They tell thee true.
2903,2904,Henry IV,4.0,5.3.8,EARL OF DOUGLAS,The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
2904,2905,Henry IV,4.0,5.3.9,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,"
2905,2906,Henry IV,4.0,5.3.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,"
2906,2907,Henry IV,4.0,5.3.11,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
2907,2908,Henry IV,5.0,5.3.12,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,"
2908,2909,Henry IV,5.0,5.3.13,SIR WALTER BLUNT,And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
2909,2910,Henry IV,5.0,5.3.14,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Lord Stafford's death.
2910,2911,Henry IV,5.0,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR
2911,2912,Henry IV,6.0,5.3.15,HOTSPUR,"O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,"
2912,2913,Henry IV,6.0,5.3.16,HOTSPUR,never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
2913,2914,Henry IV,7.0,5.3.17,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"All's done, all's won, here breathless lies the king."
2914,2915,Henry IV,8.0,5.3.18,HOTSPUR,Where?
2915,2916,Henry IV,9.0,5.3.19,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Here.
2916,2917,Henry IV,10.0,5.3.20,HOTSPUR,"This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:"
2917,2918,Henry IV,10.0,5.3.21,HOTSPUR,"A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt,"
2918,2919,Henry IV,10.0,5.3.22,HOTSPUR,Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
2919,2920,Henry IV,11.0,5.3.23,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!"
2920,2921,Henry IV,11.0,5.3.24,EARL OF DOUGLAS,A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
2921,2922,Henry IV,11.0,5.3.25,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
2922,2923,Henry IV,12.0,5.3.26,HOTSPUR,The king hath many marching in his coats.
2923,2924,Henry IV,13.0,5.3.27,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats,"
2924,2925,Henry IV,13.0,5.3.28,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,"
2925,2926,Henry IV,13.0,5.3.29,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Until I meet the king.
2926,2927,Henry IV,14.0,5.3.30,HOTSPUR,"Up, and away!"
2927,2928,Henry IV,14.0,5.3.31,HOTSPUR,Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.

2932,2933,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.34,FALSTAFF,Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
2933,2934,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.35,FALSTAFF,for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
2934,2935,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.36,FALSTAFF,"lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I"
2935,2936,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.37,FALSTAFF,need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
2936,2937,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.38,FALSTAFF,led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
2937,2938,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.39,FALSTAFF,"not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and"
2938,2939,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.40,FALSTAFF,"they are for the town's end, to beg during life."
2939,2940,Henry IV,15.0,5.3.41,FALSTAFF,But who comes here?
2940,2941,Henry IV,15.0,,FALSTAFF,Enter PRINCE HENRY
2941,2942,Henry IV,16.0,5.3.42,PRINCE HENRY,"What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:"
2942,2943,Henry IV,16.0,5.3.43,PRINCE HENRY,Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff

2945,2946,Henry IV,16.0,5.3.46,PRINCE HENRY,lend me thy sword.
2946,2947,Henry IV,17.0,5.3.47,FALSTAFF,"O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile."
2947,2948,Henry IV,17.0,5.3.48,FALSTAFF,Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
2948,2949,Henry IV,17.0,5.3.49,FALSTAFF,"done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure."
2949,2950,Henry IV,18.0,5.3.50,PRINCE HENRY,"He is, indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee,"
2950,2951,Henry IV,18.0,5.3.51,PRINCE HENRY,lend me thy sword.
2951,2952,Henry IV,19.0,5.3.52,FALSTAFF,"Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st"
2952,2953,Henry IV,19.0,5.3.53,FALSTAFF,"not my sword, but take my pistol, if thou wilt."
2953,2954,Henry IV,20.0,5.3.54,PRINCE HENRY,"Give it to me: what, is it in the case?"
2954,2955,Henry IV,21.0,5.3.55,FALSTAFF,"Ay, Hal, 'tis hot, 'tis hot, there's that will sack a city."
2955,2956,Henry IV,21.0,,FALSTAFF,"PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack"
2956,2957,Henry IV,22.0,5.3.56,PRINCE HENRY,"What, is it a time to jest and dally now?"
2957,2958,Henry IV,22.0,,PRINCE HENRY,He throws the bottle at him. Exit
2958,2959,Henry IV,23.0,5.3.57,FALSTAFF,"Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do"
2959,2960,Henry IV,23.0,5.3.58,FALSTAFF,"come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his"
2960,2961,Henry IV,23.0,5.3.59,FALSTAFF,"willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like"
2961,2962,Henry IV,23.0,5.3.60,FALSTAFF,not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
2962,2963,Henry IV,23.0,5.3.61,FALSTAFF,"life: which if I can save, so, if not, honour comes"
2963,2964,Henry IV,23.0,5.3.62,FALSTAFF,"unlooked for, and there's an end."

2970,2971,Henry IV,2.0,5.4.4,LANCASTER,"Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too."
2971,2972,Henry IV,3.0,5.4.5,PRINCE HENRY,"I beseech your majesty, make up,"
2972,2973,Henry IV,3.0,5.4.6,PRINCE HENRY,Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
2973,2974,Henry IV,4.0,5.4.7,KING HENRY IV,I will do so.

2975,2976,Henry IV,5.0,5.4.9,WESTMORELAND,"Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent."
2976,2977,Henry IV,6.0,5.4.10,PRINCE HENRY,"Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:"
2977,2978,Henry IV,6.0,5.4.11,PRINCE HENRY,And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
2978,2979,Henry IV,6.0,5.4.12,PRINCE HENRY,"The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,"
2979,2980,Henry IV,6.0,5.4.13,PRINCE HENRY,"Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,"
2980,2981,Henry IV,6.0,5.4.14,PRINCE HENRY,and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
2981,2982,Henry IV,7.0,5.4.15,LANCASTER,"We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,"
2982,2983,Henry IV,7.0,5.4.16,LANCASTER,"Our duty this way lies, for God's sake come."
2983,2984,Henry IV,7.0,,LANCASTER,Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
2984,2985,Henry IV,8.0,5.4.17,PRINCE HENRY,"By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster,"
2985,2986,Henry IV,8.0,5.4.18,PRINCE HENRY,I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
2986,2987,Henry IV,8.0,5.4.19,PRINCE HENRY,"Before, I loved thee as a brother, John,"
2987,2988,Henry IV,8.0,5.4.20,PRINCE HENRY,"But now, I do respect thee as my soul."
2988,2989,Henry IV,9.0,5.4.21,KING HENRY IV,I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
2989,2990,Henry IV,9.0,5.4.22,KING HENRY IV,With lustier maintenance than I did look for
2990,2991,Henry IV,9.0,5.4.23,KING HENRY IV,Of such an ungrown warrior.
2991,2992,Henry IV,10.0,5.4.24,PRINCE HENRY,"O, this boy"
2992,2993,Henry IV,10.0,5.4.25,PRINCE HENRY,Lends mettle to us all!

2995,2996,Henry IV,11.0,5.4.26,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
2996,2997,Henry IV,11.0,5.4.27,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I am the Douglas, fatal to all those"
2997,2998,Henry IV,11.0,5.4.28,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"That wear those colours on them: what art thou,"
2998,2999,Henry IV,11.0,5.4.29,EARL OF DOUGLAS,That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
2999,3000,Henry IV,12.0,5.4.30,KING HENRY IV,"The king himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart"
3000,3001,Henry IV,12.0,5.4.31,KING HENRY IV,So many of his shadows thou hast met
3001,3002,Henry IV,12.0,5.4.32,KING HENRY IV,And not the very king. I have two boys
3002,3003,Henry IV,12.0,5.4.33,KING HENRY IV,Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
3003,3004,Henry IV,12.0,5.4.34,KING HENRY IV,"But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,"
3004,3005,Henry IV,12.0,5.4.35,KING HENRY IV,"I will assay thee: so, defend thyself."
3005,3006,Henry IV,13.0,5.4.36,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I fear thou art another counterfeit,"
3006,3007,Henry IV,13.0,5.4.37,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:"
3007,3008,Henry IV,13.0,5.4.38,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,"
3008,3009,Henry IV,13.0,5.4.39,EARL OF DOUGLAS,And thus I win thee.

3010,3011,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.40,PRINCE HENRY,"Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like"
3011,3012,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.41,PRINCE HENRY,Never to hold it up again! the spirits
3012,3013,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.42,PRINCE HENRY,"Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:"
3013,3014,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.43,PRINCE HENRY,"It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,"
3014,3015,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.44,PRINCE HENRY,Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
3015,3016,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.44,PRINCE HENRY,They fight: DOUGLAS flies
3016,3017,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.45,PRINCE HENRY,"Cheerly, my lord	how fares your grace?"
3017,3018,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.46,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,"
3018,3019,Henry IV,14.0,5.4.47,PRINCE HENRY,And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.

3020,3021,Henry IV,15.0,5.4.49,KING HENRY IV,"Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,"
3021,3022,Henry IV,15.0,5.4.50,KING HENRY IV,"And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,"
3022,3023,Henry IV,15.0,5.4.51,KING HENRY IV,In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
3023,3024,Henry IV,16.0,5.4.52,PRINCE HENRY,O God! they did me too much injury
3024,3025,Henry IV,16.0,5.4.53,PRINCE HENRY,That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
3025,3026,Henry IV,16.0,5.4.54,PRINCE HENRY,"If it were so, I might have let alone"
3026,3027,Henry IV,16.0,5.4.55,PRINCE HENRY,"The insulting hand of Douglas over you,"
3027,3028,Henry IV,16.0,5.4.56,PRINCE HENRY,Which would have been as speedy in your end
3028,3029,Henry IV,16.0,5.4.57,PRINCE HENRY,As all the poisonous potions in the world
3029,3030,Henry IV,16.0,5.4.58,PRINCE HENRY,And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
3030,3031,Henry IV,17.0,5.4.59,KING HENRY IV,Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
3031,3032,Henry IV,17.0,,KING HENRY IV,Exit

3034,3035,Henry IV,19.0,5.4.61,PRINCE HENRY,Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
3035,3036,Henry IV,20.0,5.4.62,HOTSPUR,My name is Harry Percy.
3036,3037,Henry IV,21.0,5.4.63,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then I see"
3037,3038,Henry IV,21.0,5.4.64,PRINCE HENRY,A very valiant rebel of the name.
3038,3039,Henry IV,21.0,5.4.65,PRINCE HENRY,"I am the Prince of Wales, and think not, Percy,"
3039,3040,Henry IV,21.0,5.4.66,PRINCE HENRY,To share with me in glory any more:
3040,3041,Henry IV,21.0,5.4.67,PRINCE HENRY,"Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,"
3041,3042,Henry IV,21.0,5.4.68,PRINCE HENRY,"Nor can one England brook a double reign,"
3042,3043,Henry IV,21.0,5.4.69,PRINCE HENRY,Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
3043,3044,Henry IV,22.0,5.4.70,HOTSPUR,"Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come"
3044,3045,Henry IV,22.0,5.4.71,HOTSPUR,"To end the one of us, and would to God"
3045,3046,Henry IV,22.0,5.4.72,HOTSPUR,Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
3046,3047,Henry IV,23.0,5.4.73,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,"
3047,3048,Henry IV,23.0,5.4.74,PRINCE HENRY,And all the budding honours on thy crest
3048,3049,Henry IV,23.0,5.4.75,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll crop, to make a garland for my head."
3049,3050,Henry IV,24.0,5.4.76,HOTSPUR,I can no longer brook thy vanities.
3050,3051,Henry IV,24.0,,HOTSPUR,They fight
3051,3052,Henry IV,24.0,,HOTSPUR,Enter FALSTAFF

3053,3054,Henry IV,25.0,5.4.78,FALSTAFF,"boy's play here, I can tell you."

3056,3057,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.80,HOTSPUR,I better brook the loss of brittle life
3057,3058,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.81,HOTSPUR,"Than those proud titles thou hast won of me,"
3058,3059,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.82,HOTSPUR,They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
3059,3060,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.83,HOTSPUR,"But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool,"
3060,3061,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.84,HOTSPUR,"And time, that takes survey of all the world,"
3061,3062,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.85,HOTSPUR,"Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,"
3062,3063,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.86,HOTSPUR,But that the earthy and cold hand of death
3063,3064,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.87,HOTSPUR,"Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust"
3064,3065,Henry IV,26.0,5.4.88,HOTSPUR,And food for--

3068,3069,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.91,PRINCE HENRY,"When that this body did contain a spirit,"
3069,3070,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.92,PRINCE HENRY,"A kingdom for it was too small a bound,"
3070,3071,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.93,PRINCE HENRY,But now two paces of the vilest earth
3071,3072,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.94,PRINCE HENRY,Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
3072,3073,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.95,PRINCE HENRY,Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
3073,3074,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.96,PRINCE HENRY,"If thou wert sensible of courtesy,"
3074,3075,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.97,PRINCE HENRY,I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
3075,3076,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.98,PRINCE HENRY,"But let my favours hide thy mangled face,"

3077,3078,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.100,PRINCE HENRY,For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
3078,3079,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.101,PRINCE HENRY,"Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!"
3079,3080,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.102,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,"
3080,3081,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.103,PRINCE HENRY,But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
3081,3082,Henry IV,27.0,,PRINCE HENRY,He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
3082,3083,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.104,PRINCE HENRY,"What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh"
3083,3084,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.105,PRINCE HENRY,"Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!"
3084,3085,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.106,PRINCE HENRY,I could have better spared a better man:
3085,3086,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.107,PRINCE HENRY,"O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,"
3086,3087,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.108,PRINCE HENRY,If I were much in love with vanity!
3087,3088,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.109,PRINCE HENRY,"Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,"
3088,3089,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.110,PRINCE HENRY,"Though many dearer, in this bloody fray."
3089,3090,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.111,PRINCE HENRY,Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
3090,3091,Henry IV,27.0,5.4.112,PRINCE HENRY,Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
3091,3092,Henry IV,27.0,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit PRINCE HENRY
3092,3093,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.113,FALSTAFF,"[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,"
3093,3094,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.114,FALSTAFF,I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
3094,3095,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.115,FALSTAFF,"to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or"
3095,3096,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.116,FALSTAFF,that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
3096,3097,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.117,FALSTAFF,"Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,"
3097,3098,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.118,FALSTAFF,"is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the"
3098,3099,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.119,FALSTAFF,counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
3099,3100,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.120,FALSTAFF,"but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby"
3100,3101,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.121,FALSTAFF,"liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and"
3101,3102,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.122,FALSTAFF,perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
3102,3103,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.123,FALSTAFF,"valour is discretion, in the which better part I"
3103,3104,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.124,FALSTAFF,"have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this"
3104,3105,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.125,FALSTAFF,"gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he"
3105,3106,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.126,FALSTAFF,"should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am"
3106,3107,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.127,FALSTAFF,afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
3107,3108,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.128,FALSTAFF,"Therefore I'll make him sure, yea, and I'll swear I"
3108,3109,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.129,FALSTAFF,killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
3109,3110,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.130,FALSTAFF,"Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me."
3110,3111,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.131,FALSTAFF,"Therefore, sirrah,"
3111,3112,Henry IV,28.0,,FALSTAFF,Stabbing him
3112,3113,Henry IV,28.0,5.4.132,FALSTAFF,"with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me."
3113,3114,Henry IV,28.0,,FALSTAFF,Takes up HOTSPUR on his back

3117,3118,Henry IV,30.0,5.4.135,LANCASTER,"But, soft! whom have we here?"
3118,3119,Henry IV,30.0,5.4.136,LANCASTER,Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
3119,3120,Henry IV,31.0,5.4.137,PRINCE HENRY,"I did, I saw him dead,"
3120,3121,Henry IV,31.0,5.4.138,PRINCE HENRY,Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
3121,3122,Henry IV,31.0,5.4.139,PRINCE HENRY,thou alive?
3122,3123,Henry IV,31.0,5.4.140,PRINCE HENRY,Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
3123,3124,Henry IV,31.0,5.4.141,PRINCE HENRY,"I prithee, speak, we will not trust our eyes"
3124,3125,Henry IV,31.0,5.4.142,PRINCE HENRY,Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
3125,3126,Henry IV,32.0,5.4.143,FALSTAFF,"No, that's certain, I am not a double man: but if I"
3126,3127,Henry IV,32.0,5.4.144,FALSTAFF,"be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:"
3127,3128,Henry IV,32.0,,FALSTAFF,Throwing the body down
3128,3129,Henry IV,32.0,5.4.145,FALSTAFF,"if your father will do me any honour, so, if not, let"
3129,3130,Henry IV,32.0,5.4.146,FALSTAFF,him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
3130,3131,Henry IV,32.0,5.4.147,FALSTAFF,"earl or duke, I can assure you."
3131,3132,Henry IV,33.0,5.4.148,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead."
3132,3133,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.149,FALSTAFF,"Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to"
3133,3134,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.150,FALSTAFF,"lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath,"
3134,3135,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.151,FALSTAFF,and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
3135,3136,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.152,FALSTAFF,fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
3136,3137,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.153,FALSTAFF,"believed, so, if not, let them that should reward"
3137,3138,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.154,FALSTAFF,valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
3138,3139,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.155,FALSTAFF,"it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the"
3139,3140,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.156,FALSTAFF,"thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,"
3140,3141,Henry IV,34.0,5.4.157,FALSTAFF,"'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword."
3141,3142,Henry IV,35.0,5.4.158,LANCASTER,This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
3142,3143,Henry IV,36.0,5.4.159,PRINCE HENRY,"This is the strangest fellow, brother John."
3143,3144,Henry IV,36.0,5.4.160,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:"
3144,3145,Henry IV,36.0,5.4.161,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,"

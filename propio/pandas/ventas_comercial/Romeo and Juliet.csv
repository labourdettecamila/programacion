85282,85283,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,,RICHMOND,PROLOGUE
85283,85284,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.1,RICHMOND,"Two households, both alike in dignity,"
85284,85285,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.2,RICHMOND,"In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,"
85285,85286,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.3,RICHMOND,"From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,"
85286,85287,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.4,RICHMOND,Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
85287,85288,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.5,RICHMOND,From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
85288,85289,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.6,RICHMOND,"A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life,"
85289,85290,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.7,RICHMOND,Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
85290,85291,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.8,RICHMOND,Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
85291,85292,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.9,RICHMOND,"The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,"
85292,85293,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.10,RICHMOND,"And the continuance of their parents' rage,"
85293,85294,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.11,RICHMOND,"Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,"
85294,85295,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.12,RICHMOND,"Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage,"
85295,85296,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.13,RICHMOND,"The which if you with patient ears attend,"
85296,85297,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.14,RICHMOND,"What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend."
85297,85298,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.0.14,RICHMOND,SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
85298,85299,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,,RICHMOND,"Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers"
85299,85300,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.1.1,SAMPSON,"Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals."
85300,85301,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.1.2,GREGORY,"No, for then we should be colliers."
85301,85302,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.1.3,SAMPSON,"I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw."
85302,85303,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,1.1.4,GREGORY,"Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar."
85303,85304,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.1.5,SAMPSON,"I strike quickly, being moved."
85304,85305,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.1.6,GREGORY,But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
85305,85306,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.1.7,SAMPSON,A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
85306,85307,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,1.1.8,GREGORY,"To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand:"
85307,85308,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,1.1.9,GREGORY,"therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away."
85308,85309,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.1.10,SAMPSON,A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
85309,85310,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.1.11,SAMPSON,take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
85310,85311,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.1.12,GREGORY,"That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes"
85311,85312,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.1.13,GREGORY,to the wall.
85312,85313,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.1.14,SAMPSON,"True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,"
85313,85314,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.1.15,SAMPSON,are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
85314,85315,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.1.16,SAMPSON,"Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids"
85315,85316,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.1.17,SAMPSON,to the wall.
85316,85317,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.1.18,GREGORY,The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
85317,85318,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.1.19,SAMPSON,"'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I"
85318,85319,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.1.20,SAMPSON,"have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the"
85319,85320,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.1.21,SAMPSON,"maids, and cut off their heads."
85320,85321,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.1.22,GREGORY,The heads of the maids?
85321,85322,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.1.23,SAMPSON,"Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads,"
85322,85323,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.1.24,SAMPSON,take it in what sense thou wilt.
85323,85324,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,1.1.25,GREGORY,They must take it in sense that feel it.
85324,85325,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,1.1.26,SAMPSON,Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
85325,85326,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,1.1.27,SAMPSON,'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
85326,85327,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,1.1.28,GREGORY,"'Tis well thou art not fish, if thou hadst, thou"
85327,85328,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,1.1.29,GREGORY,hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
85328,85329,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,1.1.30,GREGORY,two of the house of the Montagues.
85329,85330,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.1.31,SAMPSON,"My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee."
85330,85331,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.1.32,GREGORY,How! turn thy back and run?
85331,85332,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,1.1.33,SAMPSON,Fear me not.
85332,85333,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.1.34,GREGORY,"No, marry, I fear thee!"
85333,85334,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.1.35,SAMPSON,"Let us take the law of our sides, let them begin."
85334,85335,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.1.36,GREGORY,"I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as"
85335,85336,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.1.37,GREGORY,they list.
85336,85337,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.1.38,SAMPSON,"Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them,"
85337,85338,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.1.39,SAMPSON,"which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it."
85338,85339,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,,SAMPSON,Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
85339,85340,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.1.40,ABRAHAM,"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
85340,85341,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.1.41,SAMPSON,"I do bite my thumb, sir."
85341,85342,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.1.42,ABRAHAM,"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
85342,85343,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,1.1.43,SAMPSON,"[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say"
85343,85344,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,1.1.44,SAMPSON,ay?
85344,85345,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,1.1.45,GREGORY,No.
85345,85346,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,1.1.46,SAMPSON,"No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I"
85346,85347,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,1.1.47,SAMPSON,"bite my thumb, sir."
85347,85348,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,1.1.48,GREGORY,"Do you quarrel, sir?"
85348,85349,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,1.1.49,ABRAHAM,"Quarrel sir! no, sir."
85349,85350,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,1.1.50,SAMPSON,"If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you."
85350,85351,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,1.1.51,ABRAHAM,No better.
85351,85352,Romeo and Juliet,36.0,1.1.52,SAMPSON,"Well, sir."
85352,85353,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,1.1.53,GREGORY,Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
85353,85354,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,1.1.54,SAMPSON,"Yes, better, sir."
85354,85355,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,1.1.55,ABRAHAM,You lie.
85355,85356,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,1.1.56,SAMPSON,"Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow."
85356,85357,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,,SAMPSON,They fight
85357,85358,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,,SAMPSON,Enter BENVOLIO
85358,85359,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,1.1.57,BENVOLIO,"Part, fools!"
85359,85360,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,1.1.58,BENVOLIO,"Put up your swords, you know not what you do."
85360,85361,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,,BENVOLIO,Beats down their swords
85361,85362,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,,BENVOLIO,Enter TYBALT
85362,85363,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,1.1.59,TYBALT,"What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?"
85363,85364,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,1.1.60,TYBALT,"Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death."
85364,85365,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,1.1.61,BENVOLIO,"I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,"
85365,85366,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,1.1.62,BENVOLIO,Or manage it to part these men with me.
85366,85367,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,1.1.63,TYBALT,"What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,"
85367,85368,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,1.1.64,TYBALT,"As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:"
85368,85369,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,1.1.65,TYBALT,"Have at thee, coward!"
85369,85370,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,,TYBALT,They fight
85370,85371,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,,TYBALT,"Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray, then enter Citizens, with clubs"
85371,85372,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,1.1.66,First Citizen,"Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!"
85372,85373,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,1.1.67,First Citizen,Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
85373,85374,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,,First Citizen,"Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET"
85374,85375,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,1.1.68,CAPULET,"What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!"
85375,85376,Romeo and Juliet,47.0,1.1.69,LADY CAPULET,"A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?"
85376,85377,Romeo and Juliet,48.0,1.1.70,CAPULET,"My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,"
85377,85378,Romeo and Juliet,48.0,1.1.71,CAPULET,And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
85378,85379,Romeo and Juliet,48.0,,CAPULET,Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
85379,85380,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,1.1.72,MONTAGUE,"Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go."
85380,85381,Romeo and Juliet,50.0,1.1.73,LADY MONTAGUE,Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
85381,85382,Romeo and Juliet,50.0,,LADY MONTAGUE,"Enter PRINCE, with Attendants"
85382,85383,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.74,PRINCE,"Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,"
85383,85384,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.75,PRINCE,"Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--"
85384,85385,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.76,PRINCE,"Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,"
85385,85386,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.77,PRINCE,That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
85386,85387,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.78,PRINCE,"With purple fountains issuing from your veins,"
85387,85388,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.79,PRINCE,"On pain of torture, from those bloody hands"
85388,85389,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.80,PRINCE,"Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,"
85389,85390,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.81,PRINCE,And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
85390,85391,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.82,PRINCE,"Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,"
85391,85392,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.83,PRINCE,"By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,"
85392,85393,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.84,PRINCE,"Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,"
85393,85394,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.85,PRINCE,And made Verona's ancient citizens
85394,85395,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.86,PRINCE,"Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,"
85395,85396,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.87,PRINCE,"To wield old partisans, in hands as old,"
85396,85397,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.88,PRINCE,"Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:"
85397,85398,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.89,PRINCE,"If ever you disturb our streets again,"
85398,85399,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.90,PRINCE,Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
85399,85400,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.91,PRINCE,"For this time, all the rest depart away:"
85400,85401,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.92,PRINCE,"You Capulet, shall go along with me:"
85401,85402,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.93,PRINCE,"And, Montague, come you this afternoon,"
85402,85403,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.94,PRINCE,"To know our further pleasure in this case,"
85403,85404,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.95,PRINCE,"To old Free-town, our common judgment-place."
85404,85405,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,1.1.96,PRINCE,"Once more, on pain of death, all men depart."
85405,85406,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,,PRINCE,"Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO"
85406,85407,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,1.1.97,MONTAGUE,Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
85407,85408,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,1.1.98,MONTAGUE,"Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?"
85408,85409,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.99,BENVOLIO,"Here were the servants of your adversary,"
85409,85410,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.100,BENVOLIO,"And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:"
85410,85411,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.101,BENVOLIO,I drew to part them: in the instant came
85411,85412,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.102,BENVOLIO,"The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,"
85412,85413,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.103,BENVOLIO,"Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,"
85413,85414,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.104,BENVOLIO,"He swung about his head and cut the winds,"
85414,85415,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.105,BENVOLIO,Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
85415,85416,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.106,BENVOLIO,"While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,"
85416,85417,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.107,BENVOLIO,"Came more and more and fought on part and part,"
85417,85418,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,1.1.108,BENVOLIO,"Till the prince came, who parted either part."
85418,85419,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,1.1.109,LADY MONTAGUE,"O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?"
85419,85420,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,1.1.110,LADY MONTAGUE,Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
85420,85421,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.111,BENVOLIO,"Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun"
85421,85422,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.112,BENVOLIO,"Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,"
85422,85423,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.113,BENVOLIO,"A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,"
85423,85424,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.114,BENVOLIO,"Where, underneath the grove of sycamore"
85424,85425,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.115,BENVOLIO,"That westward rooteth from the city's side,"
85425,85426,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.116,BENVOLIO,So early walking did I see your son:
85426,85427,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.117,BENVOLIO,"Towards him I made, but he was ware of me"
85427,85428,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.118,BENVOLIO,And stole into the covert of the wood:
85428,85429,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.119,BENVOLIO,"I, measuring his affections by my own,"
85429,85430,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.120,BENVOLIO,"That most are busied when they're most alone,"
85430,85431,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.121,BENVOLIO,"Pursued my humour not pursuing his,"
85431,85432,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,1.1.122,BENVOLIO,And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
85432,85433,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.123,MONTAGUE,"Many a morning hath he there been seen,"
85433,85434,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.124,MONTAGUE,With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
85434,85435,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.125,MONTAGUE,"Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,"
85435,85436,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.126,MONTAGUE,But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
85436,85437,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.127,MONTAGUE,Should in the furthest east begin to draw
85437,85438,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.128,MONTAGUE,"The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,"
85438,85439,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.129,MONTAGUE,"Away from the light steals home my heavy son,"
85439,85440,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.130,MONTAGUE,"And private in his chamber pens himself,"
85440,85441,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.131,MONTAGUE,"Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out"
85441,85442,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.132,MONTAGUE,And makes himself an artificial night:
85442,85443,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.133,MONTAGUE,"Black and portentous must this humour prove,"
85443,85444,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,1.1.134,MONTAGUE,Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
85444,85445,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,1.1.135,BENVOLIO,"My noble uncle, do you know the cause?"
85445,85446,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,1.1.136,MONTAGUE,I neither know it nor can learn of him.
85446,85447,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,1.1.137,BENVOLIO,Have you importuned him by any means?
85447,85448,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.138,MONTAGUE,Both by myself and many other friends:
85448,85449,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.139,MONTAGUE,"But he, his own affections' counsellor,"
85449,85450,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.140,MONTAGUE,Is to himself--I will not say how true--
85450,85451,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.141,MONTAGUE,"But to himself so secret and so close,"
85451,85452,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.142,MONTAGUE,"So far from sounding and discovery,"
85452,85453,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.143,MONTAGUE,"As is the bud bit with an envious worm,"
85453,85454,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.144,MONTAGUE,"Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,"
85454,85455,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.145,MONTAGUE,Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
85455,85456,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.146,MONTAGUE,Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
85456,85457,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,1.1.147,MONTAGUE,We would as willingly give cure as know.
85457,85458,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,,MONTAGUE,Enter ROMEO
85458,85459,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,1.1.148,BENVOLIO,"See, where he comes: so please you, step aside,"
85459,85460,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,1.1.149,BENVOLIO,"I'll know his grievance, or be much denied."
85460,85461,Romeo and Juliet,62.0,1.1.150,MONTAGUE,"I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,"
85461,85462,Romeo and Juliet,62.0,1.1.151,MONTAGUE,"To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away."

85463,85464,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,1.1.152,BENVOLIO,"Good-morrow, cousin."
85464,85465,Romeo and Juliet,64.0,1.1.153,ROMEO,Is the day so young?
85465,85466,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,1.1.154,BENVOLIO,But new struck nine.
85466,85467,Romeo and Juliet,66.0,1.1.155,ROMEO,Ay me! sad hours seem long.
85467,85468,Romeo and Juliet,66.0,1.1.156,ROMEO,Was that my father that went hence so fast?
85468,85469,Romeo and Juliet,67.0,1.1.157,BENVOLIO,It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
85469,85470,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,1.1.158,ROMEO,"Not having that, which, having, makes them short."
85470,85471,Romeo and Juliet,69.0,1.1.159,BENVOLIO,In love?
85471,85472,Romeo and Juliet,70.0,1.1.160,ROMEO,Out--
85472,85473,Romeo and Juliet,71.0,1.1.161,BENVOLIO,Of love?
85473,85474,Romeo and Juliet,72.0,1.1.162,ROMEO,"Out of her favour, where I am in love."
85474,85475,Romeo and Juliet,73.0,1.1.163,BENVOLIO,"Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,"
85475,85476,Romeo and Juliet,73.0,1.1.164,BENVOLIO,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
85476,85477,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.165,ROMEO,"Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,"
85477,85478,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.166,ROMEO,"Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!"
85478,85479,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.167,ROMEO,Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
85479,85480,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.168,ROMEO,"Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all."
85480,85481,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.169,ROMEO,"Here's much to do with hate, but more with love."
85481,85482,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.170,ROMEO,"Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!"
85482,85483,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.171,ROMEO,"O any thing, of nothing first create!"
85483,85484,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.172,ROMEO,O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
85484,85485,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.173,ROMEO,Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
85485,85486,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.174,ROMEO,"Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,"
85486,85487,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.175,ROMEO,sick health!
85487,85488,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.176,ROMEO,"Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!"
85488,85489,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.177,ROMEO,"This love feel I, that feel no love in this."
85489,85490,Romeo and Juliet,74.0,1.1.178,ROMEO,Dost thou not laugh?
85490,85491,Romeo and Juliet,75.0,1.1.179,BENVOLIO,"No, coz, I rather weep."
85491,85492,Romeo and Juliet,76.0,1.1.180,ROMEO,"Good heart, at what?"
85492,85493,Romeo and Juliet,77.0,1.1.181,BENVOLIO,At thy good heart's oppression.
85493,85494,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.182,ROMEO,"Why, such is love's transgression."
85494,85495,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.183,ROMEO,"Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,"
85495,85496,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.184,ROMEO,"Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest"
85496,85497,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.185,ROMEO,With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
85497,85498,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.186,ROMEO,Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
85498,85499,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.187,ROMEO,"Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs,"
85499,85500,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.188,ROMEO,"Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes,"
85500,85501,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.189,ROMEO,Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
85501,85502,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.190,ROMEO,"What is it else? a madness most discreet,"
85502,85503,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.191,ROMEO,A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
85503,85504,Romeo and Juliet,78.0,1.1.192,ROMEO,"Farewell, my coz."
85504,85505,Romeo and Juliet,79.0,1.1.193,BENVOLIO,"Soft! I will go along,"
85505,85506,Romeo and Juliet,79.0,1.1.194,BENVOLIO,"An if you leave me so, you do me wrong."
85506,85507,Romeo and Juliet,80.0,1.1.195,ROMEO,"Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here,"
85507,85508,Romeo and Juliet,80.0,1.1.196,ROMEO,"This is not Romeo, he's some other where."
85508,85509,Romeo and Juliet,81.0,1.1.197,BENVOLIO,"Tell me in sadness, who is that you love."
85509,85510,Romeo and Juliet,82.0,1.1.198,ROMEO,"What, shall I groan and tell thee?"
85510,85511,Romeo and Juliet,83.0,1.1.199,BENVOLIO,"Groan! why, no."
85511,85512,Romeo and Juliet,83.0,1.1.200,BENVOLIO,But sadly tell me who.
85512,85513,Romeo and Juliet,84.0,1.1.201,ROMEO,Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
85513,85514,Romeo and Juliet,84.0,1.1.202,ROMEO,"Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!"
85514,85515,Romeo and Juliet,84.0,1.1.203,ROMEO,"In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman."
85515,85516,Romeo and Juliet,85.0,1.1.204,BENVOLIO,"I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved."
85516,85517,Romeo and Juliet,86.0,1.1.205,ROMEO,A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
85517,85518,Romeo and Juliet,87.0,1.1.206,BENVOLIO,"A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit."
85518,85519,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.207,ROMEO,"Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit"
85519,85520,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.208,ROMEO,"With Cupid's arrow, she hath Dian's wit,"
85520,85521,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.209,ROMEO,"And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,"
85521,85522,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.210,ROMEO,From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
85522,85523,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.211,ROMEO,"She will not stay the siege of loving terms,"
85523,85524,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.212,ROMEO,"Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,"
85524,85525,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.213,ROMEO,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
85525,85526,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.214,ROMEO,"O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,"
85526,85527,Romeo and Juliet,88.0,1.1.215,ROMEO,That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
85527,85528,Romeo and Juliet,89.0,1.1.216,BENVOLIO,Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
85528,85529,Romeo and Juliet,90.0,1.1.217,ROMEO,"She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,"
85529,85530,Romeo and Juliet,90.0,1.1.218,ROMEO,For beauty starved with her severity
85530,85531,Romeo and Juliet,90.0,1.1.219,ROMEO,Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
85531,85532,Romeo and Juliet,90.0,1.1.220,ROMEO,"She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,"
85532,85533,Romeo and Juliet,90.0,1.1.221,ROMEO,To merit bliss by making me despair:
85533,85534,Romeo and Juliet,90.0,1.1.222,ROMEO,"She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow"
85534,85535,Romeo and Juliet,90.0,1.1.223,ROMEO,Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
85535,85536,Romeo and Juliet,91.0,1.1.224,BENVOLIO,"Be ruled by me, forget to think of her."
85536,85537,Romeo and Juliet,92.0,1.1.225,ROMEO,"O, teach me how I should forget to think."
85537,85538,Romeo and Juliet,93.0,1.1.226,BENVOLIO,"By giving liberty unto thine eyes,"
85538,85539,Romeo and Juliet,93.0,1.1.227,BENVOLIO,Examine other beauties.
85539,85540,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.228,ROMEO,'Tis the way
85540,85541,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.229,ROMEO,"To call hers exquisite, in question more:"
85541,85542,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.230,ROMEO,These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
85542,85543,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.231,ROMEO,"Being black put us in mind they hide the fair,"
85543,85544,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.232,ROMEO,He that is strucken blind cannot forget
85544,85545,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.233,ROMEO,The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
85545,85546,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.234,ROMEO,"Show me a mistress that is passing fair,"
85546,85547,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.235,ROMEO,"What doth her beauty serve, but as a note"
85547,85548,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.236,ROMEO,Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
85548,85549,Romeo and Juliet,94.0,1.1.237,ROMEO,Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
85549,85550,Romeo and Juliet,95.0,1.1.238,BENVOLIO,"I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt."
85550,85551,Romeo and Juliet,95.0,,BENVOLIO,Exeunt
85551,85552,Romeo and Juliet,95.0,,BENVOLIO,SCENE II. A street.
85552,85553,Romeo and Juliet,95.0,,BENVOLIO,"Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant"
85553,85554,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.2.1,CAPULET,"But Montague is bound as well as I,"
85554,85555,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.2.2,CAPULET,"In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard, I think,"
85555,85556,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.2.3,CAPULET,For men so old as we to keep the peace.
85556,85557,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.2.4,PARIS,"Of honourable reckoning are you both,"
85557,85558,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.2.5,PARIS,And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
85558,85559,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.2.6,PARIS,"But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?"
85559,85560,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.2.7,CAPULET,But saying o'er what I have said before:
85560,85561,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.2.8,CAPULET,"My child is yet a stranger in the world,"
85561,85562,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.2.9,CAPULET,"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,"
85562,85563,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.2.10,CAPULET,"Let two more summers wither in their pride,"
85563,85564,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.2.11,CAPULET,Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
85564,85565,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,1.2.12,PARIS,Younger than she are happy mothers made.
85565,85566,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.13,CAPULET,And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
85566,85567,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.14,CAPULET,"The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,"
85567,85568,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.15,CAPULET,She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
85568,85569,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.16,CAPULET,"But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,"
85569,85570,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.17,CAPULET,"My will to her consent is but a part,"
85570,85571,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.18,CAPULET,"An she agree, within her scope of choice"
85571,85572,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.19,CAPULET,Lies my consent and fair according voice.
85572,85573,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.20,CAPULET,"This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,"
85573,85574,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.21,CAPULET,"Whereto I have invited many a guest,"
85574,85575,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.22,CAPULET,"Such as I love, and you, among the store,"
85575,85576,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.23,CAPULET,"One more, most welcome, makes my number more."
85576,85577,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.24,CAPULET,At my poor house look to behold this night
85577,85578,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.25,CAPULET,Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
85578,85579,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.26,CAPULET,Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
85579,85580,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.27,CAPULET,When well-apparell'd April on the heel
85580,85581,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.28,CAPULET,"Of limping winter treads, even such delight"
85581,85582,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.29,CAPULET,Among fresh female buds shall you this night
85582,85583,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.30,CAPULET,"Inherit at my house, hear all, all see,"
85583,85584,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.31,CAPULET,And like her most whose merit most shall be:
85584,85585,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.32,CAPULET,"Which on more view, of many mine being one"
85585,85586,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.33,CAPULET,"May stand in number, though in reckoning none,"
85586,85587,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.34,CAPULET,"Come, go with me."
85587,85588,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,,CAPULET,"To Servant, giving a paper"
85588,85589,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.35,CAPULET,"Go, sirrah, trudge about"
85589,85590,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.36,CAPULET,"Through fair Verona, find those persons out"
85590,85591,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.37,CAPULET,"Whose names are written there, and to them say,"
85591,85592,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.2.38,CAPULET,My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
85592,85593,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,,CAPULET,Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
85593,85594,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.2.39,Servant,Find them out whose names are written here! It is
85594,85595,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.2.40,Servant,"written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his"
85595,85596,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.2.41,Servant,"yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with"
85596,85597,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.2.42,Servant,"his pencil, and the painter with his nets, but I am"
85597,85598,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.2.43,Servant,sent to find those persons whose names are here
85598,85599,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.2.44,Servant,"writ, and can never find what names the writing"
85599,85600,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.2.45,Servant,person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
85600,85601,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,,Servant,Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
85601,85602,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.2.46,BENVOLIO,"Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,"
85602,85603,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.2.47,BENVOLIO,"One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish,"
85603,85604,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.2.48,BENVOLIO,"Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning,"
85604,85605,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.2.49,BENVOLIO,One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
85605,85606,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.2.50,BENVOLIO,"Take thou some new infection to thy eye,"
85606,85607,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.2.51,BENVOLIO,And the rank poison of the old will die.
85607,85608,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,1.2.52,ROMEO,Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
85608,85609,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.2.53,BENVOLIO,"For what, I pray thee?"
85609,85610,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.2.54,ROMEO,For your broken shin.
85610,85611,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.2.55,BENVOLIO,"Why, Romeo, art thou mad?"

85613,85614,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.2.58,ROMEO,"Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow."
85614,85615,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.2.59,Servant,"God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?"
85615,85616,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.2.60,ROMEO,"Ay, mine own fortune in my misery."
85616,85617,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.2.61,Servant,"Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I"

85646,85647,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.2.89,BENVOLIO,And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
85647,85648,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.2.90,ROMEO,When the devout religion of mine eye
85648,85649,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.2.91,ROMEO,"Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires,"
85649,85650,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.2.92,ROMEO,"And these, who often drown'd could never die,"
85650,85651,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.2.93,ROMEO,"Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!"
85651,85652,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.2.94,ROMEO,One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
85652,85653,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.2.95,ROMEO,Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
85653,85654,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.2.96,BENVOLIO,"Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,"
85654,85655,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.2.97,BENVOLIO,Herself poised with herself in either eye:
85655,85656,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.2.98,BENVOLIO,But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
85656,85657,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.2.99,BENVOLIO,Your lady's love against some other maid
85657,85658,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.2.100,BENVOLIO,"That I will show you shining at this feast,"
85658,85659,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.2.101,BENVOLIO,And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
85659,85660,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,1.2.102,ROMEO,"I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,"
85660,85661,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,1.2.103,ROMEO,But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
85661,85662,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,,ROMEO,Exeunt

85665,85666,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.3.2,Nurse,"Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,"
85666,85667,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.3.3,Nurse,"I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!"
85667,85668,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.3.4,Nurse,"God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!"
85668,85669,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,,Nurse,Enter JULIET
85669,85670,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.3.5,JULIET,How now! who calls?
85670,85671,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,1.3.6,Nurse,Your mother.
85671,85672,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.3.7,JULIET,"Madam, I am here."
85672,85673,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.3.8,JULIET,What is your will?
85673,85674,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.3.9,LADY CAPULET,"This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,"
85674,85675,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.3.10,LADY CAPULET,"We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again,"
85675,85676,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.3.11,LADY CAPULET,"I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel."
85676,85677,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.3.12,LADY CAPULET,Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
85677,85678,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.3.13,Nurse,"Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour."
85678,85679,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,1.3.14,LADY CAPULET,She's not fourteen.
85679,85680,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.3.15,Nurse,"I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--"
85680,85681,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.3.16,Nurse,"And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--"
85681,85682,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.3.17,Nurse,She is not fourteen. How long is it now
85682,85683,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.3.18,Nurse,To Lammas-tide?
85683,85684,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.3.19,LADY CAPULET,A fortnight and odd days.
85684,85685,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.20,Nurse,"Even or odd, of all days in the year,"
85685,85686,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.21,Nurse,Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
85686,85687,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.22,Nurse,Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
85687,85688,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.23,Nurse,"Were of an age: well, Susan is with God,"
85688,85689,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.24,Nurse,"She was too good for me: but, as I said,"
85689,85690,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.25,Nurse,"On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen,"
85690,85691,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.26,Nurse,"That shall she, marry, I remember it well."
85691,85692,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.27,Nurse,"'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,"
85692,85693,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.28,Nurse,"And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--"
85693,85694,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.29,Nurse,"Of all the days of the year, upon that day:"
85694,85695,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.30,Nurse,"For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,"
85695,85696,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.31,Nurse,"Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall,"
85696,85697,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.32,Nurse,My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
85697,85698,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.33,Nurse,"Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,"
85698,85699,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.34,Nurse,When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
85699,85700,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.35,Nurse,"Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,"
85700,85701,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.36,Nurse,To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
85701,85702,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.37,Nurse,"Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,"
85702,85703,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.38,Nurse,To bid me trudge:
85703,85704,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.39,Nurse,"And since that time it is eleven years,"
85704,85705,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.40,Nurse,"For then she could stand alone, nay, by the rood,"
85705,85706,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.41,Nurse,"She could have run and waddled all about,"
85706,85707,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.42,Nurse,"For even the day before, she broke her brow:"
85707,85708,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.43,Nurse,And then my husband--God be with his soul!
85708,85709,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.44,Nurse,A' was a merry man--took up the child:
85709,85710,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.45,Nurse,"'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?"
85710,85711,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.46,Nurse,"Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,"
85711,85712,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.47,Nurse,"Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,"
85712,85713,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.48,Nurse,The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
85713,85714,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.49,Nurse,"To see, now, how a jest shall come about!"
85714,85715,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.50,Nurse,"I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,"
85715,85716,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.51,Nurse,"I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,"
85716,85717,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.3.52,Nurse,"And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'"
85717,85718,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.3.53,LADY CAPULET,"Enough of this, I pray thee, hold thy peace."
85718,85719,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.54,Nurse,"Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,"
85719,85720,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.55,Nurse,To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
85720,85721,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.56,Nurse,"And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow"
85721,85722,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.57,Nurse,"A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone,"
85722,85723,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.58,Nurse,"A parlous knock, and it cried bitterly:"
85723,85724,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.59,Nurse,"'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?"
85724,85725,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.60,Nurse,"Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,"
85725,85726,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.3.61,Nurse,"Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'"
85726,85727,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.3.62,JULIET,"And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I."
85727,85728,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.3.63,Nurse,"Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!"
85728,85729,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.3.64,Nurse,Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
85729,85730,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.3.65,Nurse,"An I might live to see thee married once,"
85730,85731,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.3.66,Nurse,I have my wish.
85731,85732,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,1.3.67,LADY CAPULET,"Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme"
85732,85733,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,1.3.68,LADY CAPULET,"I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,"
85733,85734,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,1.3.69,LADY CAPULET,How stands your disposition to be married?
85734,85735,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,1.3.70,JULIET,It is an honour that I dream not of.
85735,85736,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,1.3.71,Nurse,"An honour! were not I thine only nurse,"
85736,85737,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,1.3.72,Nurse,I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
85737,85738,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.3.73,LADY CAPULET,"Well, think of marriage now, younger than you,"
85738,85739,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.3.74,LADY CAPULET,"Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,"
85739,85740,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.3.75,LADY CAPULET,"Are made already mothers: by my count,"
85740,85741,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.3.76,LADY CAPULET,I was your mother much upon these years
85741,85742,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.3.77,LADY CAPULET,That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
85742,85743,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.3.78,LADY CAPULET,The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
85743,85744,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.3.79,Nurse,"A man, young lady! lady, such a man"
85744,85745,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.3.80,Nurse,"As all the world--why, he's a man of wax."
85745,85746,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,1.3.81,LADY CAPULET,Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
85746,85747,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.3.82,Nurse,"Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower."
85747,85748,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.83,LADY CAPULET,What say you? can you love the gentleman?
85748,85749,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.84,LADY CAPULET,"This night you shall behold him at our feast,"
85749,85750,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.85,LADY CAPULET,"Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,"

85752,85753,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.88,LADY CAPULET,And see how one another lends content
85753,85754,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.89,LADY CAPULET,And what obscured in this fair volume lies
85754,85755,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.90,LADY CAPULET,Find written in the margent of his eyes.
85755,85756,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.91,LADY CAPULET,"This precious book of love, this unbound lover,"
85756,85757,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.92,LADY CAPULET,"To beautify him, only lacks a cover:"
85757,85758,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.93,LADY CAPULET,"The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride"
85758,85759,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.94,LADY CAPULET,For fair without the fair within to hide:
85759,85760,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.95,LADY CAPULET,"That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,"
85760,85761,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.96,LADY CAPULET,"That in gold clasps locks in the golden story,"
85761,85762,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.97,LADY CAPULET,"So shall you share all that he doth possess,"
85762,85763,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.3.98,LADY CAPULET,"By having him, making yourself no less."
85763,85764,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.3.99,Nurse,"No less! nay, bigger, women grow by men."
85764,85765,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.3.100,LADY CAPULET,"Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?"
85765,85766,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.3.101,JULIET,"I'll look to like, if looking liking move:"
85766,85767,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.3.102,JULIET,But no more deep will I endart mine eye
85767,85768,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.3.103,JULIET,Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
85768,85769,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,,JULIET,Enter a Servant
85769,85770,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.3.104,Servant,"Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you"

85771,85772,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.3.106,Servant,"the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must"
85772,85773,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.3.107,Servant,"hence to wait, I beseech you, follow straight."
85773,85774,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.3.108,LADY CAPULET,We follow thee.
85774,85775,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,,LADY CAPULET,Exit Servant

85779,85780,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,,Nurse,"Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others"
85780,85781,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.4.1,ROMEO,"What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?"
85781,85782,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.4.2,ROMEO,Or shall we on without a apology?
85782,85783,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.3,BENVOLIO,The date is out of such prolixity:
85783,85784,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.4,BENVOLIO,"We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,"
85784,85785,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.5,BENVOLIO,"Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,"
85785,85786,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.6,BENVOLIO,"Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper,"
85786,85787,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.7,BENVOLIO,"Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke"
85787,85788,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.8,BENVOLIO,"After the prompter, for our entrance:"
85788,85789,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.9,BENVOLIO,"But let them measure us by what they will,"
85789,85790,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.4.10,BENVOLIO,"We'll measure them a measure, and be gone."
85790,85791,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.4.11,ROMEO,"Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling,"
85791,85792,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.4.12,ROMEO,"Being but heavy, I will bear the light."
85792,85793,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,1.4.13,MERCUTIO,"Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance."
85793,85794,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.4.14,ROMEO,"Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes"
85794,85795,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.4.15,ROMEO,With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
85795,85796,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.4.16,ROMEO,So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
85796,85797,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.4.17,MERCUTIO,"You are a lover, borrow Cupid's wings,"
85797,85798,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.4.18,MERCUTIO,And soar with them above a common bound.
85798,85799,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.4.19,ROMEO,I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
85799,85800,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.4.20,ROMEO,"To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,"
85800,85801,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.4.21,ROMEO,I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
85801,85802,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.4.22,ROMEO,Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
85802,85803,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,1.4.23,MERCUTIO,"And, to sink in it, should you burden love,"
85803,85804,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,1.4.24,MERCUTIO,Too great oppression for a tender thing.
85804,85805,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.4.25,ROMEO,"Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,"
85805,85806,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.4.26,ROMEO,"Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn."
85806,85807,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.4.27,MERCUTIO,"If love be rough with you, be rough with love,"
85807,85808,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.4.28,MERCUTIO,"Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down."
85808,85809,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.4.29,MERCUTIO,Give me a case to put my visage in:
85809,85810,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.4.30,MERCUTIO,A visor for a visor! what care I
85810,85811,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.4.31,MERCUTIO,What curious eye doth quote deformities?
85811,85812,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.4.32,MERCUTIO,Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
85812,85813,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.4.33,BENVOLIO,"Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in,"
85813,85814,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.4.34,BENVOLIO,But every man betake him to his legs.
85814,85815,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.4.35,ROMEO,A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
85815,85816,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.4.36,ROMEO,"Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,"
85816,85817,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.4.37,ROMEO,"For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,"
85817,85818,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.4.38,ROMEO,"I'll be a candle-holder, and look on."
85818,85819,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.4.39,ROMEO,"The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done."
85819,85820,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.4.40,MERCUTIO,"Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:"
85820,85821,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.4.41,MERCUTIO,"If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire"
85821,85822,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.4.42,MERCUTIO,"Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st"
85822,85823,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.4.43,MERCUTIO,"Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!"
85823,85824,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.4.44,ROMEO,"Nay, that's not so."
85824,85825,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.4.45,MERCUTIO,"I mean, sir, in delay"
85825,85826,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.4.46,MERCUTIO,"We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day."
85826,85827,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.4.47,MERCUTIO,"Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits"
85827,85828,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.4.48,MERCUTIO,Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
85828,85829,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,1.4.49,ROMEO,"And we mean well in going to this mask,"
85829,85830,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,1.4.50,ROMEO,But 'tis no wit to go.
85830,85831,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,1.4.51,MERCUTIO,"Why, may one ask?"
85831,85832,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,1.4.52,ROMEO,I dream'd a dream to-night.
85832,85833,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.4.53,MERCUTIO,And so did I.
85833,85834,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.4.54,ROMEO,"Well, what was yours?"
85834,85835,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,1.4.55,MERCUTIO,That dreamers often lie.
85835,85836,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.4.56,ROMEO,"In bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
85836,85837,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.57,MERCUTIO,"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you."
85837,85838,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.58,MERCUTIO,"She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes"
85838,85839,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.59,MERCUTIO,In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
85839,85840,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.60,MERCUTIO,"On the fore-finger of an alderman,"
85840,85841,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.61,MERCUTIO,Drawn with a team of little atomies
85841,85842,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.62,MERCUTIO,"Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep,"
85842,85843,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.63,MERCUTIO,"Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,"
85843,85844,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.64,MERCUTIO,"The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,"
85844,85845,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.65,MERCUTIO,"The traces of the smallest spider's web,"
85845,85846,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.66,MERCUTIO,"The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,"
85846,85847,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.67,MERCUTIO,"Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,"
85847,85848,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.68,MERCUTIO,"Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,"
85848,85849,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.69,MERCUTIO,Not so big as a round little worm
85849,85850,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.70,MERCUTIO,"Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid,"
85850,85851,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.71,MERCUTIO,Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
85851,85852,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.72,MERCUTIO,"Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,"
85852,85853,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.73,MERCUTIO,Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
85853,85854,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.74,MERCUTIO,And in this state she gallops night by night
85854,85855,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.75,MERCUTIO,"Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love,"
85855,85856,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.76,MERCUTIO,"O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,"
85856,85857,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.77,MERCUTIO,"O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,"
85857,85858,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.78,MERCUTIO,"O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,"
85858,85859,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.79,MERCUTIO,"Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,"
85859,85860,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.80,MERCUTIO,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
85860,85861,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.81,MERCUTIO,"Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,"
85861,85862,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.82,MERCUTIO,"And then dreams he of smelling out a suit,"
85862,85863,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.83,MERCUTIO,And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
85863,85864,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.84,MERCUTIO,"Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,"
85864,85865,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.85,MERCUTIO,"Then dreams, he of another benefice:"
85865,85866,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.86,MERCUTIO,"Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,"
85866,85867,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.87,MERCUTIO,"And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,"
85867,85868,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.88,MERCUTIO,"Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,"
85868,85869,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.89,MERCUTIO,"Of healths five-fathom deep, and then anon"
85869,85870,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.90,MERCUTIO,"Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,"
85870,85871,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.91,MERCUTIO,And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
85871,85872,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.92,MERCUTIO,And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
85872,85873,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.93,MERCUTIO,"That plats the manes of horses in the night,"
85873,85874,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.94,MERCUTIO,"And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,"
85874,85875,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.95,MERCUTIO,"Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:"
85875,85876,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.96,MERCUTIO,"This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,"
85876,85877,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.97,MERCUTIO,"That presses them and learns them first to bear,"
85877,85878,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.98,MERCUTIO,Making them women of good carriage:
85878,85879,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.4.99,MERCUTIO,This is she--
85879,85880,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.4.100,ROMEO,"Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!"
85880,85881,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.4.101,ROMEO,Thou talk'st of nothing.
85881,85882,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.102,MERCUTIO,"True, I talk of dreams,"
85882,85883,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.103,MERCUTIO,"Which are the children of an idle brain,"
85883,85884,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.104,MERCUTIO,"Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,"
85884,85885,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.105,MERCUTIO,Which is as thin of substance as the air
85885,85886,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.106,MERCUTIO,"And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes"
85886,85887,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.107,MERCUTIO,"Even now the frozen bosom of the north,"
85887,85888,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.108,MERCUTIO,"And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,"
85888,85889,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.4.109,MERCUTIO,Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
85889,85890,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.4.110,BENVOLIO,"This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves,"
85890,85891,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.4.111,BENVOLIO,"Supper is done, and we shall come too late."
85891,85892,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.112,ROMEO,"I fear, too early: for my mind misgives"
85892,85893,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.113,ROMEO,Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
85893,85894,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.114,ROMEO,Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
85894,85895,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.115,ROMEO,With this night's revels and expire the term
85895,85896,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.116,ROMEO,Of a despised life closed in my breast
85896,85897,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.117,ROMEO,By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
85897,85898,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.118,ROMEO,"But He, that hath the steerage of my course,"
85898,85899,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.4.119,ROMEO,"Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen."
85899,85900,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.4.120,BENVOLIO,"Strike, drum."
85900,85901,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,,BENVOLIO,Exeunt
85901,85902,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,,BENVOLIO,SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
85902,85903,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,,BENVOLIO,Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
85903,85904,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.5.1,First Servant,"Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He"
85904,85905,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,1.5.2,First Servant,shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
85905,85906,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.5.3,Second Servant,When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
85906,85907,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,1.5.4,Second Servant,"hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing."
85907,85908,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.5.5,First Servant,"Away with the joint-stools, remove the"
85908,85909,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.5.6,First Servant,"court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save"
85909,85910,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.5.7,First Servant,"me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou lovest me, let"
85910,85911,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.5.8,First Servant,the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
85911,85912,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,1.5.9,First Servant,"Antony, and Potpan!"
85912,85913,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,1.5.10,Second Servant,"Ay, boy, ready."
85913,85914,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.5.11,First Servant,"You are looked for and called for, asked for and"
85914,85915,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,1.5.12,First Servant,"sought for, in the great chamber."
85915,85916,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.5.13,Second Servant,"We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys, be"
85916,85917,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,1.5.14,Second Servant,"brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all."
85917,85918,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,,Second Servant,"Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers"
85918,85919,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.15,CAPULET,"Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes"
85919,85920,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.16,CAPULET,Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
85920,85921,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.17,CAPULET,"Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all"
85921,85922,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.18,CAPULET,"Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,"
85922,85923,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.19,CAPULET,"She, I'll swear, hath corns, am I come near ye now?"
85923,85924,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.20,CAPULET,"Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day"
85924,85925,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.21,CAPULET,That I have worn a visor and could tell
85925,85926,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.22,CAPULET,"A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,"
85926,85927,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.23,CAPULET,"Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:"
85927,85928,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.24,CAPULET,"You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play."
85928,85929,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.25,CAPULET,"A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls."
85929,85930,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,,CAPULET,"Music plays, and they dance"
85930,85931,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.26,CAPULET,"More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,"
85931,85932,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.27,CAPULET,"And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot."
85932,85933,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.28,CAPULET,"Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well."
85933,85934,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.29,CAPULET,"Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,"
85934,85935,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.30,CAPULET,For you and I are past our dancing days:
85935,85936,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.31,CAPULET,How long is't now since last yourself and I
85936,85937,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,1.5.32,CAPULET,Were in a mask?
85937,85938,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,1.5.33,Second Capulet,"By'r lady, thirty years."
85938,85939,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.5.34,CAPULET,"What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:"
85939,85940,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.5.35,CAPULET,"'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,"
85940,85941,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.5.36,CAPULET,"Come pentecost as quickly as it will,"
85941,85942,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,1.5.37,CAPULET,"Some five and twenty years, and then we mask'd."
85942,85943,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.5.38,Second Capulet,"'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir,"
85943,85944,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,1.5.39,Second Capulet,His son is thirty.
85944,85945,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.5.40,CAPULET,Will you tell me that?
85945,85946,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,1.5.41,CAPULET,His son was but a ward two years ago.
85946,85947,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.5.42,ROMEO,"[To a Servingman]  What lady is that, which doth"
85947,85948,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.5.43,ROMEO,enrich the hand
85948,85949,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,1.5.44,ROMEO,Of yonder knight?
85949,85950,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,1.5.45,Servant,"I know not, sir."
85950,85951,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.46,ROMEO,"O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!"
85951,85952,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.47,ROMEO,It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
85952,85953,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.48,ROMEO,"Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear,"
85953,85954,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.49,ROMEO,"Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!"
85954,85955,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.50,ROMEO,"So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,"
85955,85956,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.51,ROMEO,As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
85956,85957,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.52,ROMEO,"The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,"
85957,85958,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.53,ROMEO,"And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand."
85958,85959,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.54,ROMEO,"Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!"
85959,85960,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,1.5.55,ROMEO,For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
85960,85961,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.5.56,TYBALT,"This, by his voice, should be a Montague."
85961,85962,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.5.57,TYBALT,"Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave"
85962,85963,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.5.58,TYBALT,"Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,"
85963,85964,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.5.59,TYBALT,To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
85964,85965,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.5.60,TYBALT,"Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,"
85965,85966,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,1.5.61,TYBALT,"To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin."
85966,85967,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,1.5.62,CAPULET,"Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?"
85967,85968,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,1.5.63,TYBALT,"Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,"
85968,85969,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,1.5.64,TYBALT,"A villain that is hither come in spite,"
85969,85970,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,1.5.65,TYBALT,To scorn at our solemnity this night.
85970,85971,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,1.5.66,CAPULET,Young Romeo is it?
85971,85972,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,1.5.67,TYBALT,"'Tis he, that villain Romeo."
85972,85973,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.68,CAPULET,"Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,"
85973,85974,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.69,CAPULET,"He bears him like a portly gentleman,"
85974,85975,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.70,CAPULET,"And, to say truth, Verona brags of him"
85975,85976,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.71,CAPULET,To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
85976,85977,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.72,CAPULET,I would not for the wealth of all the town
85977,85978,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.73,CAPULET,Here in my house do him disparagement:
85978,85979,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.74,CAPULET,"Therefore be patient, take no note of him:"
85979,85980,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.75,CAPULET,"It is my will, the which if thou respect,"
85980,85981,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.76,CAPULET,"Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,"
85981,85982,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,1.5.77,CAPULET,And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
85982,85983,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,1.5.78,TYBALT,"It fits, when such a villain is a guest:"
85983,85984,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,1.5.79,TYBALT,I'll not endure him.
85984,85985,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.5.80,CAPULET,He shall be endured:
85985,85986,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.5.81,CAPULET,"What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to,"
85986,85987,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.5.82,CAPULET,"Am I the master here, or you? go to."
85987,85988,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.5.83,CAPULET,You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
85988,85989,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.5.84,CAPULET,You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
85989,85990,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,1.5.85,CAPULET,You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
85990,85991,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,1.5.86,TYBALT,"Why, uncle, 'tis a shame."
85991,85992,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.5.87,CAPULET,"Go to, go to,"
85992,85993,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.5.88,CAPULET,"You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?"
85993,85994,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.5.89,CAPULET,"This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:"
85994,85995,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.5.90,CAPULET,"You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time."
85995,85996,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.5.91,CAPULET,"Well said, my hearts! You are a princox, go:"
85996,85997,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.5.92,CAPULET,"Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!"
85997,85998,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,1.5.93,CAPULET,"I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!"
85998,85999,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.5.94,TYBALT,Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
85999,86000,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.5.95,TYBALT,Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
86000,86001,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,1.5.96,TYBALT,I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall

86004,86005,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.5.99,ROMEO,"This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:"
86005,86006,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.5.100,ROMEO,"My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand"
86006,86007,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,1.5.101,ROMEO,To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
86007,86008,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.5.102,JULIET,"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,"
86008,86009,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.5.103,JULIET,"Which mannerly devotion shows in this,"
86009,86010,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.5.104,JULIET,"For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,"
86010,86011,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,1.5.105,JULIET,And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
86011,86012,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,1.5.106,ROMEO,"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
86012,86013,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,1.5.107,JULIET,"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
86013,86014,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,1.5.108,ROMEO,"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do,"
86014,86015,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,1.5.109,ROMEO,"They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
86015,86016,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,1.5.110,JULIET,"Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake."
86016,86017,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,1.5.111,ROMEO,"Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take."
86017,86018,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,1.5.112,ROMEO,"Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged."
86018,86019,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,1.5.113,JULIET,Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
86019,86020,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,1.5.114,ROMEO,Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!

86117,86118,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.1.33,BENVOLIO,To be consorted with the humorous night:
86118,86119,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.1.34,BENVOLIO,Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
86119,86120,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.1.35,MERCUTIO,"If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark."

86137,86138,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.4,ROMEO,"Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,"
86138,86139,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.5,ROMEO,"Who is already sick and pale with grief,"
86139,86140,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.6,ROMEO,That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
86140,86141,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.7,ROMEO,"Be not her maid, since she is envious,"
86141,86142,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.8,ROMEO,Her vestal livery is but sick and green
86142,86143,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.9,ROMEO,"And none but fools do wear it, cast it off."

86150,86151,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.17,ROMEO,To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
86151,86152,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.18,ROMEO,"What if her eyes were there, they in her head?"
86152,86153,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.19,ROMEO,"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,"
86153,86154,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.20,ROMEO,"As daylight doth a lamp, her eyes in heaven"
86154,86155,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.21,ROMEO,Would through the airy region stream so bright
86155,86156,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.22,ROMEO,That birds would sing and think it were not night.
86156,86157,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.23,ROMEO,"See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!"
86157,86158,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.2.24,ROMEO,"O, that I were a glove upon that hand,"

86163,86164,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.2.30,ROMEO,As is a winged messenger of heaven
86164,86165,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.2.31,ROMEO,Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
86165,86166,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.2.32,ROMEO,Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
86166,86167,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.2.33,ROMEO,When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
86167,86168,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.2.34,ROMEO,And sails upon the bosom of the air.
86168,86169,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,2.2.35,JULIET,"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?"

86171,86172,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,2.2.38,JULIET,And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
86172,86173,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,2.2.39,ROMEO,"[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"
86173,86174,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.40,JULIET,"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy,"
86174,86175,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.41,JULIET,"Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."
86175,86176,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.42,JULIET,"What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,"
86176,86177,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.43,JULIET,"Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part"
86177,86178,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.44,JULIET,"Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!"
86178,86179,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.45,JULIET,What's in a name? that which we call a rose

86182,86183,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.49,JULIET,"Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,"
86183,86184,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.50,JULIET,And for that name which is no part of thee
86184,86185,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.2.51,JULIET,Take all myself.
86185,86186,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.2.52,ROMEO,I take thee at thy word:

86187,86188,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.2.54,ROMEO,Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
86188,86189,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.2.55,JULIET,What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
86189,86190,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.2.56,JULIET,So stumblest on my counsel?
86190,86191,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.2.57,ROMEO,By a name
86191,86192,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.2.58,ROMEO,I know not how to tell thee who I am:
86192,86193,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.2.59,ROMEO,"My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,"
86193,86194,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.2.60,ROMEO,"Because it is an enemy to thee,"
86194,86195,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.2.61,ROMEO,"Had I it written, I would tear the word."
86195,86196,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.2.62,JULIET,My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
86196,86197,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.2.63,JULIET,"Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:"
86197,86198,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.2.64,JULIET,Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
86198,86199,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.2.65,ROMEO,"Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike."
86199,86200,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,2.2.66,JULIET,"How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?"
86200,86201,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,2.2.67,JULIET,"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,"
86201,86202,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,2.2.68,JULIET,"And the place death, considering who thou art,"
86202,86203,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,2.2.69,JULIET,If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
86203,86204,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.2.70,ROMEO,"With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls,"
86204,86205,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.2.71,ROMEO,"For stony limits cannot hold love out,"
86205,86206,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.2.72,ROMEO,"And what love can do that dares love attempt,"
86206,86207,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.2.73,ROMEO,Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
86207,86208,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,2.2.74,JULIET,"If they do see thee, they will murder thee."
86208,86209,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.2.75,ROMEO,"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye"
86209,86210,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.2.76,ROMEO,"Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,"
86210,86211,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.2.77,ROMEO,And I am proof against their enmity.
86211,86212,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,2.2.78,JULIET,I would not for the world they saw thee here.
86212,86213,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.2.79,ROMEO,"I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight,"
86213,86214,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.2.80,ROMEO,"And but thou love me, let them find me here:"
86214,86215,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.2.81,ROMEO,"My life were better ended by their hate,"
86215,86216,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.2.82,ROMEO,"Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love."
86216,86217,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.2.83,JULIET,By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
86217,86218,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.2.84,ROMEO,"By love, who first did prompt me to inquire,"
86218,86219,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.2.85,ROMEO,He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
86219,86220,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.2.86,ROMEO,"I am no pilot, yet, wert thou as far"
86220,86221,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.2.87,ROMEO,"As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,"
86221,86222,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.2.88,ROMEO,I would adventure for such merchandise.
86222,86223,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.89,JULIET,"Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,"
86223,86224,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.90,JULIET,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
86224,86225,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.91,JULIET,For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
86225,86226,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.92,JULIET,"Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny"
86226,86227,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.93,JULIET,What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
86227,86228,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.94,JULIET,"Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'"
86228,86229,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.95,JULIET,"And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,"
86229,86230,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.96,JULIET,"Thou mayst prove false, at lovers' perjuries"
86230,86231,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.97,JULIET,"Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,"
86231,86232,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.98,JULIET,"If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:"
86232,86233,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.99,JULIET,"Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,"
86233,86234,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.100,JULIET,"I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,"
86234,86235,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.101,JULIET,"So thou wilt woo, but else, not for the world."
86235,86236,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.102,JULIET,"In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,"
86236,86237,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.103,JULIET,And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
86237,86238,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.104,JULIET,"But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true"
86238,86239,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.105,JULIET,Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
86239,86240,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.106,JULIET,"I should have been more strange, I must confess,"
86240,86241,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.107,JULIET,"But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,"
86241,86242,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.108,JULIET,"My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,"
86242,86243,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.109,JULIET,"And not impute this yielding to light love,"
86243,86244,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.2.110,JULIET,Which the dark night hath so discovered.
86244,86245,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,2.2.111,ROMEO,"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear"
86245,86246,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,2.2.112,ROMEO,That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
86246,86247,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,2.2.113,JULIET,"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,"
86247,86248,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,2.2.114,JULIET,"That monthly changes in her circled orb,"
86248,86249,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,2.2.115,JULIET,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
86249,86250,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,2.2.116,ROMEO,What shall I swear by?
86250,86251,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,2.2.117,JULIET,"Do not swear at all,"
86251,86252,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,2.2.118,JULIET,"Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,"
86252,86253,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,2.2.119,JULIET,"Which is the god of my idolatry,"
86253,86254,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,2.2.120,JULIET,And I'll believe thee.
86254,86255,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,2.2.121,ROMEO,If my heart's dear love--
86255,86256,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.122,JULIET,"Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,"
86256,86257,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.123,JULIET,I have no joy of this contract to-night:
86257,86258,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.124,JULIET,"It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,"
86258,86259,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.125,JULIET,"Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be"
86259,86260,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.126,JULIET,"Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!"
86260,86261,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.127,JULIET,"This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,"
86261,86262,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.128,JULIET,May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
86262,86263,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.129,JULIET,"Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest"
86263,86264,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.2.130,JULIET,Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
86264,86265,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,2.2.131,ROMEO,"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
86265,86266,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,2.2.132,JULIET,What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
86266,86267,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,2.2.133,ROMEO,The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
86267,86268,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,2.2.134,JULIET,I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
86268,86269,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,2.2.135,JULIET,And yet I would it were to give again.
86269,86270,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,2.2.136,ROMEO,"Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?"
86270,86271,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.137,JULIET,"But to be frank, and give it thee again."
86271,86272,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.138,JULIET,And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
86272,86273,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.139,JULIET,"My bounty is as boundless as the sea,"
86273,86274,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.140,JULIET,"My love as deep, the more I give to thee,"
86274,86275,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.141,JULIET,"The more I have, for both are infinite."
86275,86276,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,,JULIET,Nurse calls within
86276,86277,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.142,JULIET,"I hear some noise within, dear love, adieu!"
86277,86278,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.143,JULIET,"Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true."
86278,86279,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.2.144,JULIET,"Stay but a little, I will come again."
86279,86280,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,,JULIET,"Exit, above"
86280,86281,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,2.2.145,ROMEO,"O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard."
86281,86282,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,2.2.146,ROMEO,"Being in night, all this is but a dream,"
86282,86283,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,2.2.147,ROMEO,Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
86283,86284,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,,ROMEO,"Re-enter JULIET, above"
86284,86285,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.2.148,JULIET,"Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed."
86285,86286,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.2.149,JULIET,"If that thy bent of love be honourable,"
86286,86287,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.2.150,JULIET,"Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,"
86287,86288,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.2.151,JULIET,"By one that I'll procure to come to thee,"
86288,86289,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.2.152,JULIET,"Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,"
86289,86290,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.2.153,JULIET,And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
86290,86291,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.2.154,JULIET,And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
86291,86292,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,2.2.155,Nurse,[Within]  Madam!
86292,86293,Romeo and Juliet,36.0,2.2.156,JULIET,"I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,"
86293,86294,Romeo and Juliet,36.0,2.2.157,JULIET,I do beseech thee--
86294,86295,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,2.2.158,Nurse,[Within]  Madam!
86295,86296,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,2.2.159,JULIET,"By and by, I come:--"
86296,86297,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,2.2.160,JULIET,"To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:"
86297,86298,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,2.2.161,JULIET,To-morrow will I send.
86298,86299,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,2.2.162,ROMEO,So thrive my soul--
86299,86300,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,2.2.163,JULIET,A thousand times good night!
86300,86301,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,,JULIET,"Exit, above"
86301,86302,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,2.2.164,ROMEO,"A thousand times the worse, to want thy light."
86302,86303,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,2.2.165,ROMEO,"Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from"

86304,86305,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,2.2.167,ROMEO,"But love from love, toward school with heavy looks."
86305,86306,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,,ROMEO,Retiring
86306,86307,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,,ROMEO,"Re-enter JULIET, above"
86307,86308,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,2.2.168,JULIET,"Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,"
86308,86309,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,2.2.169,JULIET,To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
86309,86310,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,2.2.170,JULIET,"Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud,"
86310,86311,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,2.2.171,JULIET,"Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,"
86311,86312,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,2.2.172,JULIET,"And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,"
86312,86313,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,2.2.173,JULIET,With repetition of my Romeo's name.
86313,86314,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,2.2.174,ROMEO,It is my soul that calls upon my name:
86314,86315,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,2.2.175,ROMEO,"How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,"
86315,86316,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,2.2.176,ROMEO,Like softest music to attending ears!
86316,86317,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,2.2.177,JULIET,Romeo!
86317,86318,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,2.2.178,ROMEO,My dear?
86318,86319,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,2.2.179,JULIET,At what o'clock to-morrow
86319,86320,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,2.2.180,JULIET,Shall I send to thee?
86320,86321,Romeo and Juliet,47.0,2.2.181,ROMEO,At the hour of nine.
86321,86322,Romeo and Juliet,48.0,2.2.182,JULIET,I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
86322,86323,Romeo and Juliet,48.0,2.2.183,JULIET,I have forgot why I did call thee back.
86323,86324,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,2.2.184,ROMEO,Let me stand here till thou remember it.
86324,86325,Romeo and Juliet,50.0,2.2.185,JULIET,"I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,"
86325,86326,Romeo and Juliet,50.0,2.2.186,JULIET,Remembering how I love thy company.
86326,86327,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,2.2.187,ROMEO,"And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,"
86327,86328,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,2.2.188,ROMEO,Forgetting any other home but this.
86328,86329,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,2.2.189,JULIET,"'Tis almost morning, I would have thee gone:"
86329,86330,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,2.2.190,JULIET,"And yet no further than a wanton's bird,"
86330,86331,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,2.2.191,JULIET,"Who lets it hop a little from her hand,"
86331,86332,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,2.2.192,JULIET,"Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,"
86332,86333,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,2.2.193,JULIET,"And with a silk thread plucks it back again,"
86333,86334,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,2.2.194,JULIET,So loving-jealous of his liberty.
86334,86335,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,2.2.195,ROMEO,I would I were thy bird.
86335,86336,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,2.2.196,JULIET,"Sweet, so would I:"
86336,86337,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,2.2.197,JULIET,Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
86337,86338,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,2.2.198,JULIET,"Good night, good night! parting is such"
86338,86339,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,2.2.199,JULIET,"sweet sorrow,"
86339,86340,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,2.2.200,JULIET,That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
86340,86341,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,,JULIET,Exit above

86342,86343,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,2.2.202,ROMEO,"Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!"
86343,86344,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,2.2.203,ROMEO,"Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,"
86344,86345,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,2.2.204,ROMEO,"His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell."

86370,86371,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.23,FRIAR LAURENCE,Within the infant rind of this small flower
86371,86372,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.24,FRIAR LAURENCE,Poison hath residence and medicine power:
86372,86373,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.25,FRIAR LAURENCE,"For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part,"
86373,86374,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.26,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart."
86374,86375,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.27,FRIAR LAURENCE,Two such opposed kings encamp them still
86375,86376,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.28,FRIAR LAURENCE,"In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will,"
86376,86377,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.29,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And where the worser is predominant,"
86377,86378,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.3.30,FRIAR LAURENCE,Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
86378,86379,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Enter ROMEO
86379,86380,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.3.31,ROMEO,"Good morrow, father."
86380,86381,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.32,FRIAR LAURENCE,Benedicite!
86381,86382,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.33,FRIAR LAURENCE,What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
86382,86383,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.34,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Young son, it argues a distemper'd head"
86383,86384,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.35,FRIAR LAURENCE,So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
86384,86385,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.36,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,"
86385,86386,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.37,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And where care lodges, sleep will never lie,"
86386,86387,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.38,FRIAR LAURENCE,But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
86387,86388,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.39,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:"
86388,86389,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.40,FRIAR LAURENCE,Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
86389,86390,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.41,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thou art up-roused by some distemperature,"
86390,86391,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.42,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Or if not so, then here I hit it right,"
86391,86392,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.3.43,FRIAR LAURENCE,Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
86392,86393,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,2.3.44,ROMEO,"That last is true, the sweeter rest was mine."
86393,86394,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,2.3.45,FRIAR LAURENCE,God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
86394,86395,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.3.46,ROMEO,"With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no,"
86395,86396,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.3.47,ROMEO,"I have forgot that name, and that name's woe."
86396,86397,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.3.48,FRIAR LAURENCE,"That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?"
86397,86398,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.3.49,ROMEO,"I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again."
86398,86399,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.3.50,ROMEO,"I have been feasting with mine enemy,"
86399,86400,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.3.51,ROMEO,"Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,"
86400,86401,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.3.52,ROMEO,That's by me wounded: both our remedies
86401,86402,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.3.53,ROMEO,Within thy help and holy physic lies:
86402,86403,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.3.54,ROMEO,"I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,"
86403,86404,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.3.55,ROMEO,My intercession likewise steads my foe.
86404,86405,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.3.56,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift,"
86405,86406,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.3.57,FRIAR LAURENCE,Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
86406,86407,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.58,ROMEO,Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
86407,86408,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.59,ROMEO,On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
86408,86409,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.60,ROMEO,"As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,"
86409,86410,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.61,ROMEO,"And all combined, save what thou must combine"
86410,86411,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.62,ROMEO,By holy marriage: when and where and how
86411,86412,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.63,ROMEO,"We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,"
86412,86413,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.64,ROMEO,"I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,"
86413,86414,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.3.65,ROMEO,That thou consent to marry us to-day.
86414,86415,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.66,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!"
86415,86416,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.67,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,"
86416,86417,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.68,FRIAR LAURENCE,So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
86417,86418,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.69,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes."
86418,86419,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.70,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine"
86419,86420,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.71,FRIAR LAURENCE,Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
86420,86421,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.72,FRIAR LAURENCE,"How much salt water thrown away in waste,"
86421,86422,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.73,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To season love, that of it doth not taste!"
86422,86423,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.74,FRIAR LAURENCE,"The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,"
86423,86424,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.75,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears,"
86424,86425,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.76,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit"
86425,86426,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.77,FRIAR LAURENCE,Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
86426,86427,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.78,FRIAR LAURENCE,"If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,"
86427,86428,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.79,FRIAR LAURENCE,Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
86428,86429,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.80,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,"
86429,86430,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.3.81,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Women may fall, when there's no strength in men."
86430,86431,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,2.3.82,ROMEO,Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
86431,86432,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.3.83,FRIAR LAURENCE,"For doting, not for loving, pupil mine."
86432,86433,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,2.3.84,ROMEO,And bad'st me bury love.
86433,86434,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.3.85,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Not in a grave,"
86434,86435,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.3.86,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To lay one in, another out to have."
86435,86436,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,2.3.87,ROMEO,"I pray thee, chide not, she whom I love now"
86436,86437,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,2.3.88,ROMEO,"Doth grace for grace and love for love allow,"
86437,86438,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,2.3.89,ROMEO,The other did not so.
86438,86439,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.3.90,FRIAR LAURENCE,"O, she knew well"
86439,86440,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.3.91,FRIAR LAURENCE,Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
86440,86441,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.3.92,FRIAR LAURENCE,"But come, young waverer, come, go with me,"
86441,86442,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.3.93,FRIAR LAURENCE,"In one respect I'll thy assistant be,"
86442,86443,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.3.94,FRIAR LAURENCE,"For this alliance may so happy prove,"
86443,86444,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.3.95,FRIAR LAURENCE,To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
86444,86445,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.3.96,ROMEO,"O, let us hence, I stand on sudden haste."
86445,86446,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.3.97,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Wisely and slow, they stumble that run fast."
86446,86447,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Exeunt
86447,86448,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,SCENE IV. A street.
86448,86449,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
86449,86450,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.4.1,MERCUTIO,Where the devil should this Romeo be?
86450,86451,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.4.2,MERCUTIO,Came he not home to-night?
86451,86452,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.4.3,BENVOLIO,"Not to his father's, I spoke with his man."
86452,86453,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.4.4,MERCUTIO,"Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline."
86453,86454,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.4.5,MERCUTIO,"Torments him so, that he will sure run mad."
86454,86455,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,2.4.6,BENVOLIO,"Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,"
86455,86456,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,2.4.7,BENVOLIO,Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
86456,86457,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,2.4.8,MERCUTIO,"A challenge, on my life."
86457,86458,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.4.9,BENVOLIO,Romeo will answer it.
86458,86459,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.4.10,MERCUTIO,Any man that can write may answer a letter.
86459,86460,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.4.11,BENVOLIO,"Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he"
86460,86461,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.4.12,BENVOLIO,"dares, being dared."
86461,86462,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.4.13,MERCUTIO,"Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead, stabbed with a"
86462,86463,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.4.14,MERCUTIO,"white wench's black eye, shot through the ear with a"
86463,86464,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.4.15,MERCUTIO,"love-song, the very pin of his heart cleft with the"
86464,86465,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.4.16,MERCUTIO,blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
86465,86466,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.4.17,MERCUTIO,encounter Tybalt?
86466,86467,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,2.4.18,BENVOLIO,"Why, what is Tybalt?"
86467,86468,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.19,MERCUTIO,"More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is"
86468,86469,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.20,MERCUTIO,the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
86469,86470,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.21,MERCUTIO,"you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and"
86470,86471,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.22,MERCUTIO,"proportion, rests me his minim rest, one, two, and"
86471,86472,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.23,MERCUTIO,the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
86472,86473,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.24,MERCUTIO,"button, a duellist, a duellist, a gentleman of the"
86473,86474,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.25,MERCUTIO,"very first house, of the first and second cause:"
86474,86475,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.26,MERCUTIO,"ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the"
86475,86476,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,2.4.27,MERCUTIO,hai!
86476,86477,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,2.4.28,BENVOLIO,The what?
86477,86478,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.29,MERCUTIO,"The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting"
86478,86479,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.30,MERCUTIO,"fantasticoes, these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,"
86479,86480,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.31,MERCUTIO,a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
86480,86481,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.32,MERCUTIO,"whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,"
86481,86482,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.33,MERCUTIO,"grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with"
86482,86483,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.34,MERCUTIO,"these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these"
86483,86484,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.35,MERCUTIO,"perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,"
86484,86485,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.36,MERCUTIO,"that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their"
86485,86486,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.4.37,MERCUTIO,"bones, their bones!"
86486,86487,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,,MERCUTIO,Enter ROMEO
86487,86488,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,2.4.38,BENVOLIO,"Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo."
86488,86489,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.39,MERCUTIO,"Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,"
86489,86490,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.40,MERCUTIO,how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
86490,86491,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.41,MERCUTIO,that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
86491,86492,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.42,MERCUTIO,"kitchen-wench, marry, she had a better love to"
86492,86493,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.43,MERCUTIO,"be-rhyme her, Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gipsy,"
86493,86494,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.44,MERCUTIO,"Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a grey"
86494,86495,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.45,MERCUTIO,"eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior"
86495,86496,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.46,MERCUTIO,"Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation"
86496,86497,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.47,MERCUTIO,to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
86497,86498,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.4.48,MERCUTIO,fairly last night.
86498,86499,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,2.4.49,ROMEO,Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
86499,86500,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.4.50,MERCUTIO,"The ship, sir, the slip, can you not conceive?"
86500,86501,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.4.51,ROMEO,"Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in"
86501,86502,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.4.52,ROMEO,such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
86502,86503,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.4.53,MERCUTIO,"That's as much as to say, such a case as yours"
86503,86504,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.4.54,MERCUTIO,constrains a man to bow in the hams.
86504,86505,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,2.4.55,ROMEO,"Meaning, to court'sy."
86505,86506,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,2.4.56,MERCUTIO,Thou hast most kindly hit it.
86506,86507,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,2.4.57,ROMEO,A most courteous exposition.
86507,86508,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,2.4.58,MERCUTIO,"Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy."
86508,86509,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,2.4.59,ROMEO,Pink for flower.
86509,86510,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,2.4.60,MERCUTIO,Right.
86510,86511,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,2.4.61,ROMEO,"Why, then is my pump well flowered."
86511,86512,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,2.4.62,MERCUTIO,Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
86512,86513,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,2.4.63,MERCUTIO,"worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it"
86513,86514,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,2.4.64,MERCUTIO,"is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular."
86514,86515,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,2.4.65,ROMEO,"O single-soled jest, solely singular for the"
86515,86516,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,2.4.66,ROMEO,singleness.
86516,86517,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,2.4.67,MERCUTIO,"Come between us, good Benvolio, my wits faint."
86517,86518,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,2.4.68,ROMEO,"Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry a match."
86518,86519,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,2.4.69,MERCUTIO,"Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have"
86519,86520,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,2.4.70,MERCUTIO,"done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of"
86520,86521,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,2.4.71,MERCUTIO,"thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:"
86521,86522,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,2.4.72,MERCUTIO,was I with you there for the goose?
86522,86523,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.4.73,ROMEO,Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
86523,86524,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,2.4.74,ROMEO,not there for the goose.
86524,86525,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,2.4.75,MERCUTIO,I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
86525,86526,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,2.4.76,ROMEO,"Nay, good goose, bite not."
86526,86527,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,2.4.77,MERCUTIO,"Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most"
86527,86528,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,2.4.78,MERCUTIO,sharp sauce.
86528,86529,Romeo and Juliet,36.0,2.4.79,ROMEO,And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
86529,86530,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,2.4.80,MERCUTIO,"O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an"
86530,86531,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,2.4.81,MERCUTIO,inch narrow to an ell broad!
86531,86532,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,2.4.82,ROMEO,"I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which added"
86532,86533,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,2.4.83,ROMEO,"to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose."
86533,86534,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,2.4.84,MERCUTIO,"Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?"
86534,86535,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,2.4.85,MERCUTIO,"now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo, now art"
86535,86536,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,2.4.86,MERCUTIO,"thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:"
86536,86537,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,2.4.87,MERCUTIO,"for this drivelling love is like a great natural,"
86537,86538,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,2.4.88,MERCUTIO,that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
86538,86539,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,2.4.89,BENVOLIO,"Stop there, stop there."
86539,86540,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,2.4.90,MERCUTIO,Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
86540,86541,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,2.4.91,BENVOLIO,Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
86541,86542,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,2.4.92,MERCUTIO,"O, thou art deceived, I would have made it short:"
86542,86543,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,2.4.93,MERCUTIO,"for I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and"
86543,86544,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,2.4.94,MERCUTIO,"meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer."
86544,86545,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,2.4.95,ROMEO,Here's goodly gear!
86545,86546,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,,ROMEO,Enter Nurse and PETER

86728,86729,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.5.61,JULIET,"'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,"
86729,86730,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,2.5.62,JULIET,Where is your mother?'
86730,86731,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,2.5.63,Nurse,O God's lady dear!
86731,86732,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,2.5.64,Nurse,"Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow,"
86732,86733,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,2.5.65,Nurse,Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
86733,86734,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,2.5.66,Nurse,Henceforward do your messages yourself.
86734,86735,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,2.5.67,JULIET,"Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?"
86735,86736,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,2.5.68,Nurse,Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
86736,86737,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,2.5.69,JULIET,I have.
86737,86738,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.70,Nurse,"Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell,"
86738,86739,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.71,Nurse,There stays a husband to make you a wife:
86739,86740,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.72,Nurse,"Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,"
86740,86741,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.73,Nurse,They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
86741,86742,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.74,Nurse,"Hie you to church, I must another way,"
86742,86743,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.75,Nurse,"To fetch a ladder, by the which your love"
86743,86744,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.76,Nurse,Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
86744,86745,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.77,Nurse,"I am the drudge and toil in your delight,"
86745,86746,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.78,Nurse,But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
86746,86747,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,2.5.79,Nurse,"Go, I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell."
86747,86748,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,2.5.80,JULIET,"Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell."
86748,86749,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,,JULIET,Exeunt
86749,86750,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,,JULIET,SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
86750,86751,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,,JULIET,Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
86751,86752,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.6.1,FRIAR LAURENCE,"So smile the heavens upon this holy act,"
86752,86753,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,2.6.2,FRIAR LAURENCE,That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
86753,86754,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.6.3,ROMEO,"Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,"
86754,86755,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.6.4,ROMEO,It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
86755,86756,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.6.5,ROMEO,That one short minute gives me in her sight:
86756,86757,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.6.6,ROMEO,"Do thou but close our hands with holy words,"
86757,86758,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.6.7,ROMEO,"Then love-devouring death do what he dare,"
86758,86759,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,2.6.8,ROMEO,It is enough I may but call her mine.
86759,86760,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.9,FRIAR LAURENCE,These violent delights have violent ends
86760,86761,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.10,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,"
86761,86762,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.11,FRIAR LAURENCE,Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
86762,86763,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.12,FRIAR LAURENCE,Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
86763,86764,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.13,FRIAR LAURENCE,And in the taste confounds the appetite:
86764,86765,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.14,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Therefore love moderately, long love doth so,"
86765,86766,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.15,FRIAR LAURENCE,Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
86766,86767,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Enter JULIET
86767,86768,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.16,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot"
86768,86769,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.17,FRIAR LAURENCE,Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
86769,86770,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.18,FRIAR LAURENCE,A lover may bestride the gossamer
86770,86771,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.19,FRIAR LAURENCE,"That idles in the wanton summer air,"
86771,86772,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,2.6.20,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And yet not fall, so light is vanity."
86772,86773,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,2.6.21,JULIET,Good even to my ghostly confessor.
86773,86774,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,2.6.22,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both."
86774,86775,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,2.6.23,JULIET,"As much to him, else is his thanks too much."
86775,86776,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.6.24,ROMEO,"Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy"
86776,86777,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.6.25,ROMEO,Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
86777,86778,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.6.26,ROMEO,"To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath"
86778,86779,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.6.27,ROMEO,"This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue"
86779,86780,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.6.28,ROMEO,Unfold the imagined happiness that both
86780,86781,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,2.6.29,ROMEO,Receive in either by this dear encounter.
86781,86782,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.6.30,JULIET,"Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,"
86782,86783,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.6.31,JULIET,"Brags of his substance, not of ornament:"
86783,86784,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.6.32,JULIET,"They are but beggars that can count their worth,"
86784,86785,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.6.33,JULIET,But my true love is grown to such excess
86785,86786,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,2.6.34,JULIET,I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
86786,86787,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.6.35,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Come, come with me, and we will make short work,"
86787,86788,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.6.36,FRIAR LAURENCE,"For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone"
86788,86789,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,2.6.37,FRIAR LAURENCE,Till holy church incorporate two in one.
86789,86790,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Exeunt
86790,86791,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,ACT III
86791,86792,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,SCENE I. A public place.
86792,86793,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants"
86793,86794,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.1.1,BENVOLIO,"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:"
86794,86795,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.1.2,BENVOLIO,"The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,"
86795,86796,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.1.3,BENVOLIO,"And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,"
86796,86797,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.1.4,BENVOLIO,"For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."
86797,86798,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.1.5,MERCUTIO,Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
86798,86799,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.1.6,MERCUTIO,enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
86799,86800,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.1.7,MERCUTIO,upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
86800,86801,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.1.8,MERCUTIO,thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
86801,86802,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.1.9,MERCUTIO,"it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need."
86802,86803,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.1.10,BENVOLIO,Am I like such a fellow?
86803,86804,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.1.11,MERCUTIO,"Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as"
86804,86805,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.1.12,MERCUTIO,"any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as"
86805,86806,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.1.13,MERCUTIO,soon moody to be moved.
86806,86807,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.1.14,BENVOLIO,And what to?
86807,86808,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.15,MERCUTIO,"Nay, an there were two such, we should have none"
86808,86809,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.16,MERCUTIO,"shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,"
86809,86810,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.17,MERCUTIO,"thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,"
86810,86811,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.18,MERCUTIO,"or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou"
86811,86812,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.19,MERCUTIO,"wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no"
86812,86813,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.20,MERCUTIO,other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
86813,86814,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.21,MERCUTIO,eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
86814,86815,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.22,MERCUTIO,Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
86815,86816,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.23,MERCUTIO,"meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as"
86816,86817,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.24,MERCUTIO,an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
86817,86818,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.25,MERCUTIO,"man for coughing in the street, because he hath"
86818,86819,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.26,MERCUTIO,wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
86819,86820,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.27,MERCUTIO,didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
86820,86821,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.28,MERCUTIO,"his new doublet before Easter? with another, for"
86821,86822,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.29,MERCUTIO,tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
86822,86823,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.1.30,MERCUTIO,wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
86823,86824,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.1.31,BENVOLIO,"An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man"
86824,86825,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.1.32,BENVOLIO,should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
86825,86826,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.1.33,MERCUTIO,The fee-simple! O simple!
86826,86827,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.1.34,BENVOLIO,"By my head, here come the Capulets."
86827,86828,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.1.35,MERCUTIO,"By my heel, I care not."
86828,86829,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,,MERCUTIO,Enter TYBALT and others
86829,86830,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.1.36,TYBALT,"Follow me close, for I will speak to them."
86830,86831,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.1.37,TYBALT,"Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you."
86831,86832,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.1.38,MERCUTIO,And but one word with one of us? couple it with
86832,86833,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.1.39,MERCUTIO,"something, make it a word and a blow."
86833,86834,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.1.40,TYBALT,"You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you"
86834,86835,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.1.41,TYBALT,will give me occasion.
86835,86836,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,3.1.42,MERCUTIO,Could you not take some occasion without giving?
86836,86837,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.1.43,TYBALT,"Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--"
86837,86838,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.1.44,MERCUTIO,"Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an"
86838,86839,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.1.45,MERCUTIO,"thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but"
86839,86840,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.1.46,MERCUTIO,"discords: here's my fiddlestick, here's that shall"
86840,86841,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.1.47,MERCUTIO,"make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!"
86841,86842,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.1.48,BENVOLIO,We talk here in the public haunt of men:
86842,86843,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.1.49,BENVOLIO,"Either withdraw unto some private place,"
86843,86844,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.1.50,BENVOLIO,"And reason coldly of your grievances,"
86844,86845,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.1.51,BENVOLIO,"Or else depart, here all eyes gaze on us."
86845,86846,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.1.52,MERCUTIO,"Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze,"
86846,86847,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.1.53,MERCUTIO,"I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I."
86847,86848,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,,MERCUTIO,Enter ROMEO
86848,86849,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.1.54,TYBALT,"Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man."
86849,86850,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.1.55,MERCUTIO,"But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:"
86850,86851,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.1.56,MERCUTIO,"Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower,"
86851,86852,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.1.57,MERCUTIO,Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
86852,86853,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.1.58,TYBALT,"Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford"
86853,86854,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.1.59,TYBALT,"No better term than this,--thou art a villain."
86854,86855,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.1.60,ROMEO,"Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee"
86855,86856,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.1.61,ROMEO,Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
86856,86857,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.1.62,ROMEO,"To such a greeting: villain am I none,"
86857,86858,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.1.63,ROMEO,"Therefore farewell, I see thou know'st me not."
86858,86859,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.1.64,TYBALT,"Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries"
86859,86860,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.1.65,TYBALT,"That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw."
86860,86861,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,3.1.66,ROMEO,"I do protest, I never injured thee,"
86861,86862,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,3.1.67,ROMEO,"But love thee better than thou canst devise,"
86862,86863,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,3.1.68,ROMEO,Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
86863,86864,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,3.1.69,ROMEO,"And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender"
86864,86865,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,3.1.70,ROMEO,"As dearly as my own,--be satisfied."
86865,86866,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,3.1.71,MERCUTIO,"O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!"
86866,86867,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,3.1.72,MERCUTIO,Alla stoccata carries it away.

86869,86870,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,3.1.74,TYBALT,What wouldst thou have with me?
86870,86871,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,3.1.75,MERCUTIO,"Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine"
86871,86872,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,3.1.76,MERCUTIO,"lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and as you"

86875,86876,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,3.1.80,MERCUTIO,ears ere it be out.
86876,86877,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,3.1.81,TYBALT,I am for you.

86889,86890,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.1.91,MERCUTIO,"Is he gone, and hath nothing?"
86890,86891,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.1.92,BENVOLIO,"What, art thou hurt?"
86891,86892,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.1.93,MERCUTIO,"Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch, marry, 'tis enough."
86892,86893,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.1.94,MERCUTIO,"Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon."

86920,86921,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.1.119,BENVOLIO,Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
86921,86922,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,3.1.120,ROMEO,"This day's black fate on more days doth depend,"
86922,86923,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,3.1.121,ROMEO,"This but begins the woe, others must end."
86923,86924,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.1.122,BENVOLIO,Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

86926,86927,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,3.1.125,ROMEO,And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

86931,86932,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,3.1.129,ROMEO,Staying for thine to keep him company:
86932,86933,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,3.1.130,ROMEO,"Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him."
86933,86934,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,3.1.131,TYBALT,"Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,"
86934,86935,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,3.1.132,TYBALT,Shalt with him hence.
86935,86936,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,3.1.133,ROMEO,This shall determine that.

86947,86948,Romeo and Juliet,50.0,3.1.142,BENVOLIO,There lies that Tybalt.
86948,86949,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,3.1.143,First Citizen,"Up, sir, go with me,"
86949,86950,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,3.1.144,First Citizen,"I charge thee in the princes name, obey."

86953,86954,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,3.1.147,BENVOLIO,The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:

86955,86956,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,3.1.149,BENVOLIO,"That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio."

86961,86962,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,3.1.155,PRINCE,"Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?"
86962,86963,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.156,BENVOLIO,"Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay,"

86964,86965,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.158,BENVOLIO,"How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal"
86965,86966,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.159,BENVOLIO,Your high displeasure: all this uttered
86966,86967,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.160,BENVOLIO,"With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,"
86967,86968,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.161,BENVOLIO,Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
86968,86969,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.162,BENVOLIO,"Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts"
86969,86970,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.163,BENVOLIO,"With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,"
86970,86971,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.164,BENVOLIO,"Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,"
86971,86972,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.165,BENVOLIO,"And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats"
86972,86973,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.166,BENVOLIO,"Cold death aside, and with the other sends"
86973,86974,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.167,BENVOLIO,"It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,"
86974,86975,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.168,BENVOLIO,"Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,"

86978,86979,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.172,BENVOLIO,"And 'twixt them rushes, underneath whose arm"
86979,86980,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.173,BENVOLIO,An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
86980,86981,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.174,BENVOLIO,"Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled,"
86981,86982,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.175,BENVOLIO,"But by and by comes back to Romeo,"
86982,86983,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.176,BENVOLIO,"Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,"
86983,86984,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.177,BENVOLIO,"And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I"
86984,86985,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.178,BENVOLIO,"Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain."
86985,86986,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.179,BENVOLIO,"And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly."
86986,86987,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.1.180,BENVOLIO,"This is the truth, or let Benvolio die."
86987,86988,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.1.181,LADY CAPULET,"He is a kinsman to the Montague,"
86988,86989,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.1.182,LADY CAPULET,"Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:"
86989,86990,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.1.183,LADY CAPULET,"Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,"
86990,86991,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.1.184,LADY CAPULET,And all those twenty could but kill one life.

86992,86993,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.1.186,LADY CAPULET,"Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live."
86993,86994,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.1.187,PRINCE,"Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio,"
86994,86995,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.1.188,PRINCE,Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
86995,86996,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,3.1.189,MONTAGUE,"Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend,"
86996,86997,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,3.1.190,MONTAGUE,"His fault concludes but what the law should end,"
86997,86998,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,3.1.191,MONTAGUE,The life of Tybalt.
86998,86999,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.192,PRINCE,And for that offence
86999,87000,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.193,PRINCE,Immediately we do exile him hence:
87000,87001,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.194,PRINCE,"I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,"
87001,87002,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.195,PRINCE,"My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding,"
87002,87003,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.196,PRINCE,But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
87003,87004,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.197,PRINCE,That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
87004,87005,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.198,PRINCE,"I will be deaf to pleading and excuses,"
87005,87006,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.199,PRINCE,Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
87006,87007,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.200,PRINCE,"Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,"
87007,87008,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.201,PRINCE,"Else, when he's found, that hour is his last."
87008,87009,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.202,PRINCE,Bear hence this body and attend our will:
87009,87010,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.1.203,PRINCE,"Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill."
87010,87011,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,,PRINCE,Exeunt

87012,87013,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,,PRINCE,Enter JULIET
87013,87014,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.1,JULIET,"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,"
87014,87015,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.2,JULIET,Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
87015,87016,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.3,JULIET,"As Phaethon would whip you to the west,"
87016,87017,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.4,JULIET,And bring in cloudy night immediately.
87017,87018,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.5,JULIET,"Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,"
87018,87019,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.6,JULIET,That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
87019,87020,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.7,JULIET,"Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."
87020,87021,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.8,JULIET,Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
87021,87022,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.9,JULIET,"By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,"
87022,87023,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.10,JULIET,"It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,"
87023,87024,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.11,JULIET,"Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,"
87024,87025,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.12,JULIET,"And learn me how to lose a winning match,"
87025,87026,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.13,JULIET,Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
87026,87027,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.14,JULIET,"Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,"
87027,87028,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.15,JULIET,"With thy black mantle, till strange love, grown bold,"
87028,87029,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.16,JULIET,Think true love acted simple modesty.
87029,87030,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.17,JULIET,"Come, night, come, Romeo, come, thou day in night,"
87030,87031,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.18,JULIET,For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
87031,87032,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.19,JULIET,Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
87032,87033,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.20,JULIET,"Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,"
87033,87034,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.21,JULIET,"Give me my Romeo, and, when he shall die,"
87034,87035,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.22,JULIET,"Take him and cut him out in little stars,"
87035,87036,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.23,JULIET,And he will make the face of heaven so fine
87036,87037,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.24,JULIET,That all the world will be in love with night
87037,87038,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.25,JULIET,And pay no worship to the garish sun.
87038,87039,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.26,JULIET,"O, I have bought the mansion of a love,"
87039,87040,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.27,JULIET,"But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,"
87040,87041,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.28,JULIET,Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
87041,87042,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.29,JULIET,As is the night before some festival
87042,87043,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.30,JULIET,To an impatient child that hath new robes
87043,87044,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.31,JULIET,"And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,"
87044,87045,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.32,JULIET,"And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks"
87045,87046,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.33,JULIET,But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
87046,87047,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,,JULIET,"Enter Nurse, with cords"
87047,87048,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.34,JULIET,"Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords"
87048,87049,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.2.35,JULIET,That Romeo bid thee fetch?
87049,87050,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.2.36,Nurse,"Ay, ay, the cords."
87050,87051,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,,Nurse,Throws them down
87051,87052,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.2.37,JULIET,Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
87052,87053,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.2.38,Nurse,"Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!"
87053,87054,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.2.39,Nurse,"We are undone, lady, we are undone!"
87054,87055,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.2.40,Nurse,"Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!"
87055,87056,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.2.41,JULIET,Can heaven be so envious?
87056,87057,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.2.42,Nurse,"Romeo can,"
87057,87058,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.2.43,Nurse,"Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!"
87058,87059,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.2.44,Nurse,Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
87059,87060,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.45,JULIET,"What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?"
87060,87061,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.46,JULIET,This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
87061,87062,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.47,JULIET,"Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'"
87062,87063,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.48,JULIET,And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
87063,87064,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.49,JULIET,Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
87064,87065,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.50,JULIET,"I am not I, if there be such an I,"
87065,87066,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.51,JULIET,"Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'"
87066,87067,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.52,JULIET,"If he be slain, say 'I', or if not, no:"
87067,87068,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.2.53,JULIET,Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
87068,87069,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.2.54,Nurse,"I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--"
87069,87070,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.2.55,Nurse,God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
87070,87071,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.2.56,Nurse,"A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,"
87071,87072,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.2.57,Nurse,"Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,"
87072,87073,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.2.58,Nurse,"All in gore-blood, I swounded at the sight."
87073,87074,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.2.59,JULIET,"O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!"
87074,87075,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.2.60,JULIET,"To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!"
87075,87076,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.2.61,JULIET,"Vile earth, to earth resign, end motion here,"
87076,87077,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.2.62,JULIET,And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
87077,87078,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.2.63,Nurse,"O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!"
87078,87079,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.2.64,Nurse,O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
87079,87080,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.2.65,Nurse,That ever I should live to see thee dead!
87080,87081,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.2.66,JULIET,What storm is this that blows so contrary?
87081,87082,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.2.67,JULIET,"Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?"
87082,87083,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.2.68,JULIET,"My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?"
87083,87084,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.2.69,JULIET,"Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!"
87084,87085,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.2.70,JULIET,"For who is living, if those two are gone?"
87085,87086,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.2.71,Nurse,"Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,"
87086,87087,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.2.72,Nurse,"Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished."
87087,87088,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.2.73,JULIET,O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

87089,87090,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.75,JULIET,"O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!"
87090,87091,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.76,JULIET,Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
87091,87092,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.77,JULIET,Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
87092,87093,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.78,JULIET,Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
87093,87094,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.79,JULIET,Despised substance of divinest show!
87094,87095,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.80,JULIET,"Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,"
87095,87096,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.81,JULIET,"A damned saint, an honourable villain!"
87096,87097,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.82,JULIET,"O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,"
87097,87098,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.83,JULIET,When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
87098,87099,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.84,JULIET,In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
87099,87100,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.85,JULIET,Was ever book containing such vile matter
87100,87101,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.86,JULIET,So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
87101,87102,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.2.87,JULIET,In such a gorgeous palace!
87102,87103,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.2.88,Nurse,"There's no trust,"
87103,87104,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.2.89,Nurse,"No faith, no honesty in men, all perjured,"

87105,87106,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.2.91,Nurse,"Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:"
87106,87107,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.2.92,Nurse,"These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old."
87107,87108,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.2.93,Nurse,Shame come to Romeo!
87108,87109,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.2.94,JULIET,Blister'd be thy tongue
87109,87110,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.2.95,JULIET,For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
87110,87111,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.2.96,JULIET,"Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,"
87111,87112,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.2.97,JULIET,For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
87112,87113,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.2.98,JULIET,Sole monarch of the universal earth.
87113,87114,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.2.99,JULIET,"O, what a beast was I to chide at him!"
87114,87115,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.2.100,Nurse,Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
87115,87116,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.101,JULIET,Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
87116,87117,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.102,JULIET,"Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,"
87117,87118,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.103,JULIET,"When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?"
87118,87119,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.104,JULIET,"But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?"
87119,87120,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.105,JULIET,That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
87120,87121,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.106,JULIET,"Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,"
87121,87122,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.107,JULIET,"Your tributary drops belong to woe,"
87122,87123,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.108,JULIET,"Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy."
87123,87124,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.109,JULIET,"My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,"
87124,87125,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.110,JULIET,"And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:"
87125,87126,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.111,JULIET,"All this is comfort, wherefore weep I then?"
87126,87127,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.112,JULIET,"Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,"
87127,87128,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.113,JULIET,"That murder'd me: I would forget it fain,"
87128,87129,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.114,JULIET,"But, O, it presses to my memory,"
87129,87130,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.115,JULIET,Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
87130,87131,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.116,JULIET,"'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished,'"
87131,87132,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.117,JULIET,"That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'"
87132,87133,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.118,JULIET,Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
87133,87134,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.119,JULIET,"Was woe enough, if it had ended there:"
87134,87135,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.120,JULIET,"Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship"
87135,87136,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.121,JULIET,"And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,"
87136,87137,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.122,JULIET,"Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'"
87137,87138,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.123,JULIET,"Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,"
87138,87139,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.124,JULIET,Which modern lamentations might have moved?
87139,87140,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.125,JULIET,"But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,"
87140,87141,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.126,JULIET,"'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,"
87141,87142,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.127,JULIET,"Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,"
87142,87143,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.128,JULIET,"All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'"
87143,87144,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.129,JULIET,"There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,"
87144,87145,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.130,JULIET,"In that word's death, no words can that woe sound."
87145,87146,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.2.131,JULIET,"Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?"
87146,87147,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.2.132,Nurse,Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
87147,87148,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.2.133,Nurse,Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
87148,87149,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.134,JULIET,"Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,"
87149,87150,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.135,JULIET,"When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment."
87150,87151,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.136,JULIET,"Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,"
87151,87152,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.137,JULIET,"Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled:"
87152,87153,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.138,JULIET,"He made you for a highway to my bed,"
87153,87154,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.139,JULIET,"But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed."
87154,87155,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.140,JULIET,"Come, cords, come, nurse, I'll to my wedding-bed,"
87155,87156,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.2.141,JULIET,"And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!"
87156,87157,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.2.142,Nurse,Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
87157,87158,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.2.143,Nurse,To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
87158,87159,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.2.144,Nurse,"Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:"
87159,87160,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.2.145,Nurse,"I'll to him, he is hid at Laurence' cell."
87160,87161,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.2.146,JULIET,"O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,"
87161,87162,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.2.147,JULIET,And bid him come to take his last farewell.
87162,87163,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,,JULIET,Exeunt
87163,87164,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,,JULIET,SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
87164,87165,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,,JULIET,Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
87165,87166,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.3.1,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Romeo, come forth, come forth, thou fearful man:"
87166,87167,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.3.2,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,"
87167,87168,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.3.3,FRIAR LAURENCE,And thou art wedded to calamity.
87168,87169,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Enter ROMEO
87169,87170,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.3.4,ROMEO,"Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?"
87170,87171,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.3.5,ROMEO,"What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,"
87171,87172,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.3.6,ROMEO,That I yet know not?
87172,87173,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.3.7,FRIAR LAURENCE,Too familiar
87173,87174,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.3.8,FRIAR LAURENCE,Is my dear son with such sour company:
87174,87175,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.3.9,FRIAR LAURENCE,I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
87175,87176,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.3.10,ROMEO,What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
87176,87177,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.3.11,FRIAR LAURENCE,"A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,"
87177,87178,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.3.12,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Not body's death, but body's banishment."
87178,87179,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.3.13,ROMEO,"Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death,'"
87179,87180,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.3.14,ROMEO,"For exile hath more terror in his look,"
87180,87181,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.3.15,ROMEO,Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
87181,87182,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.3.16,FRIAR LAURENCE,Hence from Verona art thou banished:
87182,87183,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.3.17,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Be patient, for the world is broad and wide."
87183,87184,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.3.18,ROMEO,"There is no world without Verona walls,"
87184,87185,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.3.19,ROMEO,"But purgatory, torture, hell itself."
87185,87186,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.3.20,ROMEO,"Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,"
87186,87187,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.3.21,ROMEO,"And world's exile is death: then banished,"
87187,87188,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.3.22,ROMEO,"Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,"
87188,87189,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.3.23,ROMEO,"Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,"
87189,87190,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.3.24,ROMEO,And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
87190,87191,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.3.25,FRIAR LAURENCE,O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
87191,87192,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.3.26,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,"
87192,87193,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.3.27,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,"
87193,87194,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.3.28,FRIAR LAURENCE,And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
87194,87195,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,3.3.29,FRIAR LAURENCE,"This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not."
87195,87196,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.30,ROMEO,"'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,"
87196,87197,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.31,ROMEO,"Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog"
87197,87198,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.32,ROMEO,"And little mouse, every unworthy thing,"
87198,87199,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.33,ROMEO,"Live here in heaven and may look on her,"
87199,87200,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.34,ROMEO,"But Romeo may not: more validity,"
87200,87201,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.35,ROMEO,"More honourable state, more courtship lives"
87201,87202,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.36,ROMEO,In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
87202,87203,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.37,ROMEO,On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
87203,87204,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.38,ROMEO,"And steal immortal blessing from her lips,"
87204,87205,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.39,ROMEO,"Who even in pure and vestal modesty,"
87205,87206,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.40,ROMEO,"Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin,"
87206,87207,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.41,ROMEO,"But Romeo may not, he is banished:"
87207,87208,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.42,ROMEO,"Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:"
87208,87209,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.43,ROMEO,"They are free men, but I am banished."
87209,87210,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.44,ROMEO,And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
87210,87211,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.45,ROMEO,"Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,"
87211,87212,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.46,ROMEO,"No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,"
87212,87213,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.47,ROMEO,But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
87213,87214,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.48,ROMEO,"O friar, the damned use that word in hell,"
87214,87215,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.49,ROMEO,"Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,"
87215,87216,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.50,ROMEO,"Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,"
87216,87217,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.51,ROMEO,"A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,"
87217,87218,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,3.3.52,ROMEO,To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
87218,87219,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,3.3.53,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word."
87219,87220,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.3.54,ROMEO,"O, thou wilt speak again of banishment."
87220,87221,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.3.55,FRIAR LAURENCE,I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
87221,87222,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.3.56,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,"
87222,87223,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.3.57,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To comfort thee, though thou art banished."
87223,87224,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,3.3.58,ROMEO,Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
87224,87225,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,3.3.59,ROMEO,"Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,"
87225,87226,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,3.3.60,ROMEO,"Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,"
87226,87227,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,3.3.61,ROMEO,"It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more."
87227,87228,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.3.62,FRIAR LAURENCE,"O, then I see that madmen have no ears."
87228,87229,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.3.63,ROMEO,"How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"
87229,87230,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.3.64,FRIAR LAURENCE,Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
87230,87231,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.3.65,ROMEO,Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
87231,87232,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.3.66,ROMEO,"Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,"
87232,87233,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.3.67,ROMEO,"An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,"
87233,87234,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.3.68,ROMEO,"Doting like me and like me banished,"
87234,87235,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.3.69,ROMEO,"Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,"
87235,87236,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.3.70,ROMEO,"And fall upon the ground, as I do now,"
87236,87237,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.3.71,ROMEO,Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
87237,87238,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,,ROMEO,Knocking within
87238,87239,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.3.72,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Arise, one knocks, good Romeo, hide thyself."
87239,87240,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.3.73,ROMEO,"Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,"
87240,87241,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.3.74,ROMEO,"Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes."
87241,87242,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,,ROMEO,Knocking

87268,87269,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,3.3.98,ROMEO,Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
87269,87270,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,3.3.99,ROMEO,With blood removed but little from her own?
87270,87271,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,3.3.100,ROMEO,Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
87271,87272,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,3.3.101,ROMEO,My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
87272,87273,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,3.3.102,Nurse,"O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,"
87273,87274,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,3.3.103,Nurse,"And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,"
87274,87275,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,3.3.104,Nurse,"And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,"
87275,87276,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,3.3.105,Nurse,And then down falls again.
87276,87277,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.3.106,ROMEO,"As if that name,"
87277,87278,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.3.107,ROMEO,"Shot from the deadly level of a gun,"
87278,87279,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.3.108,ROMEO,"Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand"
87279,87280,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.3.109,ROMEO,"Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,"
87280,87281,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.3.110,ROMEO,In what vile part of this anatomy
87281,87282,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.3.111,ROMEO,"Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack"
87282,87283,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.3.112,ROMEO,The hateful mansion.
87283,87284,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,,ROMEO,Drawing his sword
87284,87285,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.113,FRIAR LAURENCE,Hold thy desperate hand:
87285,87286,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.114,FRIAR LAURENCE,Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
87286,87287,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.115,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote"
87287,87288,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.116,FRIAR LAURENCE,The unreasonable fury of a beast:
87288,87289,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.117,FRIAR LAURENCE,Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
87289,87290,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.118,FRIAR LAURENCE,Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
87290,87291,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.119,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,"
87291,87292,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.120,FRIAR LAURENCE,I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
87292,87293,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.121,FRIAR LAURENCE,Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
87293,87294,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.122,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,"
87294,87295,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.123,FRIAR LAURENCE,By doing damned hate upon thyself?
87295,87296,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.124,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?"
87296,87297,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.125,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet"
87297,87298,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.126,FRIAR LAURENCE,"In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose."
87298,87299,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.127,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,"
87299,87300,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.128,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,"
87300,87301,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.129,FRIAR LAURENCE,And usest none in that true use indeed
87301,87302,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.130,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:"
87302,87303,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.131,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,"
87303,87304,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.132,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Digressing from the valour of a man,"
87304,87305,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.133,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,"
87305,87306,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.134,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish,"
87306,87307,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.135,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,"
87307,87308,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.136,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Misshapen in the conduct of them both,"
87308,87309,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.137,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,"
87309,87310,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.138,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Is set afire by thine own ignorance,"
87310,87311,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.139,FRIAR LAURENCE,And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
87311,87312,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.140,FRIAR LAURENCE,"What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,"
87312,87313,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.141,FRIAR LAURENCE,"For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead,"
87313,87314,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.142,FRIAR LAURENCE,"There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,"
87314,87315,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.143,FRIAR LAURENCE,"But thou slew'st Tybalt, there are thou happy too:"
87315,87316,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.144,FRIAR LAURENCE,The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
87316,87317,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.145,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And turns it to exile, there art thou happy:"
87317,87318,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.146,FRIAR LAURENCE,"A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back,"
87318,87319,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.147,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Happiness courts thee in her best array,"
87319,87320,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.148,FRIAR LAURENCE,"But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,"
87320,87321,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.149,FRIAR LAURENCE,Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
87321,87322,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.150,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable."
87322,87323,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.151,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,"
87323,87324,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.152,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:"
87324,87325,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.153,FRIAR LAURENCE,"But look thou stay not till the watch be set,"
87325,87326,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.154,FRIAR LAURENCE,"For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,"
87326,87327,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.155,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time"
87327,87328,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.156,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,"
87328,87329,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.157,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back"
87329,87330,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.158,FRIAR LAURENCE,With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
87330,87331,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.159,FRIAR LAURENCE,Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
87331,87332,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.160,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady,"
87332,87333,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.161,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And bid her hasten all the house to bed,"
87333,87334,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.162,FRIAR LAURENCE,Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
87334,87335,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.3.163,FRIAR LAURENCE,Romeo is coming.
87335,87336,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.3.164,Nurse,"O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night"
87336,87337,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.3.165,Nurse,"To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!"
87337,87338,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.3.166,Nurse,"My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come."
87338,87339,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.3.167,ROMEO,"Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide."
87339,87340,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,3.3.168,Nurse,"Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:"
87340,87341,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,3.3.169,Nurse,"Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late."
87341,87342,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,,Nurse,Exit
87342,87343,Romeo and Juliet,36.0,3.3.170,ROMEO,How well my comfort is revived by this!
87343,87344,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.3.171,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:"
87344,87345,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.3.172,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Either be gone before the watch be set,"
87345,87346,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.3.173,FRIAR LAURENCE,Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
87346,87347,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.3.174,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Sojourn in Mantua, I'll find out your man,"
87347,87348,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.3.175,FRIAR LAURENCE,And he shall signify from time to time
87348,87349,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.3.176,FRIAR LAURENCE,Every good hap to you that chances here:
87349,87350,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.3.177,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Give me thy hand, 'tis late: farewell, good night."
87350,87351,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,3.3.178,ROMEO,"But that a joy past joy calls out on me,"
87351,87352,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,3.3.179,ROMEO,"It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell."

87356,87357,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.4.2,CAPULET,That we have had no time to move our daughter:
87357,87358,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.4.3,CAPULET,"Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,"
87358,87359,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.4.4,CAPULET,"And so did I:--Well, we were born to die."
87359,87360,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.4.5,CAPULET,"'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:"
87360,87361,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.4.6,CAPULET,"I promise you, but for your company,"
87361,87362,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.4.7,CAPULET,I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
87362,87363,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.4.8,PARIS,These times of woe afford no time to woo.
87363,87364,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.4.9,PARIS,"Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter."
87364,87365,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.4.10,LADY CAPULET,"I will, and know her mind early to-morrow,"
87365,87366,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.4.11,LADY CAPULET,To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
87366,87367,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.4.12,CAPULET,"Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender"
87367,87368,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.4.13,CAPULET,Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
87368,87369,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.4.14,CAPULET,"In all respects by me, nay, more, I doubt it not."
87369,87370,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.4.15,CAPULET,"Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,"

87373,87374,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.4.19,PARIS,"Monday, my lord,"

87376,87377,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.22,CAPULET,She shall be married to this noble earl.
87377,87378,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.23,CAPULET,Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
87378,87379,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.24,CAPULET,"We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two,"
87379,87380,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.25,CAPULET,"For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,"
87380,87381,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.26,CAPULET,"It may be thought we held him carelessly,"
87381,87382,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.27,CAPULET,"Being our kinsman, if we revel much:"
87382,87383,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.28,CAPULET,"Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,"
87383,87384,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.4.29,CAPULET,And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
87384,87385,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.4.30,PARIS,"My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow."
87385,87386,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.4.31,CAPULET,"Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then."
87386,87387,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.4.32,CAPULET,"Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,"
87387,87388,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.4.33,CAPULET,"Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day."
87388,87389,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.4.34,CAPULET,"Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!"
87389,87390,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.4.35,CAPULET,"Afore me! it is so very very late,"
87390,87391,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,3.4.36,CAPULET,That we may call it early by and by.

87395,87396,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.5.1,JULIET,Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
87396,87397,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.5.2,JULIET,"It was the nightingale, and not the lark,"
87397,87398,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.5.3,JULIET,"That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear,"
87398,87399,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.5.4,JULIET,Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
87399,87400,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,3.5.5,JULIET,"Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
87400,87401,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.5.6,ROMEO,"It was the lark, the herald of the morn,"
87401,87402,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.5.7,ROMEO,"No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks"
87402,87403,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.5.8,ROMEO,Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
87403,87404,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.5.9,ROMEO,"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day"
87404,87405,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.5.10,ROMEO,Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
87405,87406,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,3.5.11,ROMEO,"I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
87406,87407,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.5.12,JULIET,"Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:"
87407,87408,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.5.13,JULIET,"It is some meteor that the sun exhales,"
87408,87409,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.5.14,JULIET,"To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,"
87409,87410,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.5.15,JULIET,And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
87410,87411,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,3.5.16,JULIET,"Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone."
87411,87412,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.17,ROMEO,"Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death,"
87412,87413,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.18,ROMEO,"I am content, so thou wilt have it so."
87413,87414,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.19,ROMEO,"I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,"
87414,87415,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.20,ROMEO,"'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow,"
87415,87416,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.21,ROMEO,"Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat"
87416,87417,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.22,ROMEO,The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
87417,87418,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.23,ROMEO,I have more care to stay than will to go:
87418,87419,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.24,ROMEO,"Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so."
87419,87420,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,3.5.25,ROMEO,"How is't, my soul? let's talk, it is not day."
87420,87421,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.26,JULIET,"It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!"
87421,87422,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.27,JULIET,"It is the lark that sings so out of tune,"
87422,87423,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.28,JULIET,Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
87423,87424,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.29,JULIET,"Some say the lark makes sweet division,"
87424,87425,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.30,JULIET,"This doth not so, for she divideth us:"
87425,87426,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.31,JULIET,"Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,"
87426,87427,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.32,JULIET,"O, now I would they had changed voices too!"
87427,87428,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.33,JULIET,"Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,"
87428,87429,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.34,JULIET,"Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,"
87429,87430,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,3.5.35,JULIET,"O, now be gone, more light and light it grows."
87430,87431,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,3.5.36,ROMEO,"More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!"
87431,87432,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,,ROMEO,"Enter Nurse, to the chamber"
87432,87433,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,3.5.37,Nurse,Madam!

87439,87440,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,,ROMEO,He goeth down
87440,87441,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.5.43,JULIET,"Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!"
87441,87442,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.5.44,JULIET,"I must hear from thee every day in the hour,"
87442,87443,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.5.45,JULIET,For in a minute there are many days:
87443,87444,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.5.46,JULIET,"O, by this count I shall be much in years"
87444,87445,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,3.5.47,JULIET,Ere I again behold my Romeo!
87445,87446,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.5.48,ROMEO,Farewell!
87446,87447,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.5.49,ROMEO,I will omit no opportunity
87447,87448,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,3.5.50,ROMEO,"That may convey my greetings, love, to thee."
87448,87449,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,3.5.51,JULIET,O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
87449,87450,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.5.52,ROMEO,"I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve"
87450,87451,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,3.5.53,ROMEO,For sweet discourses in our time to come.
87451,87452,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.5.54,JULIET,"O God, I have an ill-divining soul!"
87452,87453,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.5.55,JULIET,"Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,"
87453,87454,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.5.56,JULIET,As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
87454,87455,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,3.5.57,JULIET,"Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale."
87455,87456,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.5.58,ROMEO,"And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:"
87456,87457,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,3.5.59,ROMEO,"Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!"
87457,87458,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,,ROMEO,Exit
87458,87459,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.5.60,JULIET,"O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:"
87459,87460,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.5.61,JULIET,"If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him."
87460,87461,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.5.62,JULIET,"That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune,"
87461,87462,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.5.63,JULIET,"For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,"
87462,87463,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,3.5.64,JULIET,But send him back.
87463,87464,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,3.5.65,LADY CAPULET,"[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?"
87464,87465,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.5.66,JULIET,Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
87465,87466,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.5.67,JULIET,"Is she not down so late, or up so early?"
87466,87467,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,3.5.68,JULIET,What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
87467,87468,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,,JULIET,Enter LADY CAPULET
87468,87469,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,3.5.69,LADY CAPULET,"Why, how now, Juliet!"
87469,87470,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,3.5.70,JULIET,"Madam, I am not well."
87470,87471,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.5.71,LADY CAPULET,Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
87471,87472,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.5.72,LADY CAPULET,"What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?"
87472,87473,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.5.73,LADY CAPULET,"An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live,"
87473,87474,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.5.74,LADY CAPULET,"Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love,"
87474,87475,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,3.5.75,LADY CAPULET,But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
87475,87476,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,3.5.76,JULIET,Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
87476,87477,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,3.5.77,LADY CAPULET,"So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend"
87477,87478,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,3.5.78,LADY CAPULET,Which you weep for.
87478,87479,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,3.5.79,JULIET,"Feeling so the loss,"
87479,87480,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,3.5.80,JULIET,Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
87480,87481,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,3.5.81,LADY CAPULET,"Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,"
87481,87482,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,3.5.82,LADY CAPULET,As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
87482,87483,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,3.5.83,JULIET,What villain madam?
87483,87484,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,3.5.84,LADY CAPULET,"That same villain, Romeo."
87484,87485,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,3.5.85,JULIET,[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
87485,87486,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,3.5.86,JULIET,"God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart,"
87486,87487,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,3.5.87,JULIET,And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
87487,87488,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,3.5.88,LADY CAPULET,"That is, because the traitor murderer lives."
87488,87489,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.5.89,JULIET,"Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:"
87489,87490,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,3.5.90,JULIET,Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
87490,87491,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.5.91,LADY CAPULET,"We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:"
87491,87492,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.5.92,LADY CAPULET,"Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,"
87492,87493,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.5.93,LADY CAPULET,"Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,"
87493,87494,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.5.94,LADY CAPULET,"Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,"
87494,87495,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.5.95,LADY CAPULET,That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
87495,87496,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,3.5.96,LADY CAPULET,"And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied."
87496,87497,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.97,JULIET,"Indeed, I never shall be satisfied"
87497,87498,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.98,JULIET,"With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--"
87498,87499,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.99,JULIET,Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
87499,87500,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.100,JULIET,"Madam, if you could find out but a man"
87500,87501,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.101,JULIET,"To bear a poison, I would temper it,"
87501,87502,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.102,JULIET,"That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,"
87502,87503,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.103,JULIET,"Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors"
87503,87504,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.104,JULIET,"To hear him named, and cannot come to him."
87504,87505,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.105,JULIET,To wreak the love I bore my cousin
87505,87506,Romeo and Juliet,34.0,3.5.106,JULIET,Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
87506,87507,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,3.5.107,LADY CAPULET,"Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man."
87507,87508,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,3.5.108,LADY CAPULET,"But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl."
87508,87509,Romeo and Juliet,36.0,3.5.109,JULIET,And joy comes well in such a needy time:
87509,87510,Romeo and Juliet,36.0,3.5.110,JULIET,"What are they, I beseech your ladyship?"
87510,87511,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.5.111,LADY CAPULET,"Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,"
87511,87512,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.5.112,LADY CAPULET,"One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,"
87512,87513,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.5.113,LADY CAPULET,"Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,"
87513,87514,Romeo and Juliet,37.0,3.5.114,LADY CAPULET,That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
87514,87515,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,3.5.115,JULIET,"Madam, in happy time, what day is that?"
87515,87516,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,3.5.116,LADY CAPULET,"Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,"
87516,87517,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,3.5.117,LADY CAPULET,"The gallant, young and noble gentleman,"
87517,87518,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,3.5.118,LADY CAPULET,"The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,"
87518,87519,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,3.5.119,LADY CAPULET,Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
87519,87520,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.120,JULIET,"Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,"
87520,87521,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.121,JULIET,He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
87521,87522,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.122,JULIET,"I wonder at this haste, that I must wed"
87522,87523,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.123,JULIET,"Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo."
87523,87524,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.124,JULIET,"I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,"
87524,87525,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.125,JULIET,"I will not marry yet, and, when I do, I swear,"
87525,87526,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.126,JULIET,"It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,"
87526,87527,Romeo and Juliet,40.0,3.5.127,JULIET,Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
87527,87528,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,3.5.128,LADY CAPULET,"Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,"
87528,87529,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,3.5.129,LADY CAPULET,And see how he will take it at your hands.
87529,87530,Romeo and Juliet,41.0,,LADY CAPULET,Enter CAPULET and Nurse
87530,87531,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.130,CAPULET,"When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew,"
87531,87532,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.131,CAPULET,But for the sunset of my brother's son
87532,87533,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.132,CAPULET,It rains downright.
87533,87534,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.133,CAPULET,"How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?"
87534,87535,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.134,CAPULET,Evermore showering? In one little body
87535,87536,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.135,CAPULET,"Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind,"
87536,87537,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.136,CAPULET,"For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,"
87537,87538,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.137,CAPULET,"Do ebb and flow with tears, the bark thy body is,"
87538,87539,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.138,CAPULET,"Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,"
87539,87540,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.139,CAPULET,"Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,"
87540,87541,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.140,CAPULET,"Without a sudden calm, will overset"
87541,87542,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.141,CAPULET,"Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!"
87542,87543,Romeo and Juliet,42.0,3.5.142,CAPULET,Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
87543,87544,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,3.5.143,LADY CAPULET,"Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks."
87544,87545,Romeo and Juliet,43.0,3.5.144,LADY CAPULET,I would the fool were married to her grave!
87545,87546,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,3.5.145,CAPULET,"Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife."
87546,87547,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,3.5.146,CAPULET,How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
87547,87548,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,3.5.147,CAPULET,"Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,"
87548,87549,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,3.5.148,CAPULET,"Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought"
87549,87550,Romeo and Juliet,44.0,3.5.149,CAPULET,So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
87550,87551,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,3.5.150,JULIET,"Not proud, you have, but thankful, that you have:"
87551,87552,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,3.5.151,JULIET,"Proud can I never be of what I hate,"
87552,87553,Romeo and Juliet,45.0,3.5.152,JULIET,"But thankful even for hate, that is meant love."
87553,87554,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.153,CAPULET,"How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?"
87554,87555,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.154,CAPULET,"'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not,'"
87555,87556,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.155,CAPULET,"And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,"
87556,87557,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.156,CAPULET,"Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,"
87557,87558,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.157,CAPULET,"But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,"
87558,87559,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.158,CAPULET,"To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,"
87559,87560,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.159,CAPULET,Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
87560,87561,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.160,CAPULET,"Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!"
87561,87562,Romeo and Juliet,46.0,3.5.161,CAPULET,You tallow-face!
87562,87563,Romeo and Juliet,47.0,3.5.162,LADY CAPULET,"Fie, fie! what, are you mad?"
87563,87564,Romeo and Juliet,48.0,3.5.163,JULIET,"Good father, I beseech you on my knees,"
87564,87565,Romeo and Juliet,48.0,3.5.164,JULIET,Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
87565,87566,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.165,CAPULET,"Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!"
87566,87567,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.166,CAPULET,"I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,"
87567,87568,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.167,CAPULET,Or never after look me in the face:
87568,87569,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.168,CAPULET,"Speak not, reply not, do not answer me,"
87569,87570,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.169,CAPULET,"My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest"
87570,87571,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.170,CAPULET,"That God had lent us but this only child,"
87571,87572,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.171,CAPULET,"But now I see this one is one too much,"
87572,87573,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.172,CAPULET,And that we have a curse in having her:
87573,87574,Romeo and Juliet,49.0,3.5.173,CAPULET,"Out on her, hilding!"
87574,87575,Romeo and Juliet,50.0,3.5.174,Nurse,God in heaven bless her!
87575,87576,Romeo and Juliet,50.0,3.5.175,Nurse,"You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so."
87576,87577,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,3.5.176,CAPULET,"And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,"
87577,87578,Romeo and Juliet,51.0,3.5.177,CAPULET,"Good prudence, smatter with your gossips, go."
87578,87579,Romeo and Juliet,52.0,3.5.178,Nurse,I speak no treason.
87579,87580,Romeo and Juliet,53.0,3.5.179,CAPULET,"O, God ye god-den."
87580,87581,Romeo and Juliet,54.0,3.5.180,Nurse,May not one speak?
87581,87582,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,3.5.181,CAPULET,"Peace, you mumbling fool!"
87582,87583,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,3.5.182,CAPULET,"Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,"
87583,87584,Romeo and Juliet,55.0,3.5.183,CAPULET,For here we need it not.
87584,87585,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,3.5.184,LADY CAPULET,You are too hot.
87585,87586,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.185,CAPULET,God's bread! it makes me mad:
87586,87587,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.186,CAPULET,"Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,"
87587,87588,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.187,CAPULET,"Alone, in company, still my care hath been"
87588,87589,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.188,CAPULET,To have her match'd: and having now provided
87589,87590,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.189,CAPULET,"A gentleman of noble parentage,"
87590,87591,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.190,CAPULET,"Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,"
87591,87592,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.191,CAPULET,"Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,"
87592,87593,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.192,CAPULET,"Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man,"
87593,87594,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.193,CAPULET,"And then to have a wretched puling fool,"
87594,87595,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.194,CAPULET,"A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,"
87595,87596,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.195,CAPULET,"To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love,"
87596,87597,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.196,CAPULET,"I am too young, I pray you, pardon me.'"
87597,87598,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.197,CAPULET,"But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:"
87598,87599,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.198,CAPULET,Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
87599,87600,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.199,CAPULET,"Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest."
87600,87601,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.200,CAPULET,"Thursday is near, lay hand on heart, advise:"
87601,87602,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.201,CAPULET,"An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend,"
87602,87603,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.202,CAPULET,"And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in"
87603,87604,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.203,CAPULET,"the streets,"
87604,87605,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.204,CAPULET,"For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,"
87605,87606,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.205,CAPULET,Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
87606,87607,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,3.5.206,CAPULET,"Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn."
87607,87608,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,,CAPULET,Exit
87608,87609,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.5.207,JULIET,"Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,"
87609,87610,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.5.208,JULIET,That sees into the bottom of my grief?
87610,87611,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.5.209,JULIET,"O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!"
87611,87612,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.5.210,JULIET,"Delay this marriage for a month, a week,"
87612,87613,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.5.211,JULIET,"Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed"
87613,87614,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,3.5.212,JULIET,In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
87614,87615,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,3.5.213,LADY CAPULET,"Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:"
87615,87616,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,3.5.214,LADY CAPULET,"Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee."
87616,87617,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,,LADY CAPULET,Exit
87617,87618,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.215,JULIET,"O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?"
87618,87619,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.216,JULIET,"My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven,"
87619,87620,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.217,JULIET,"How shall that faith return again to earth,"
87620,87621,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.218,JULIET,Unless that husband send it me from heaven
87621,87622,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.219,JULIET,"By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me."
87622,87623,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.220,JULIET,"Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems"
87623,87624,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.221,JULIET,Upon so soft a subject as myself!
87624,87625,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.222,JULIET,What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
87625,87626,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,3.5.223,JULIET,"Some comfort, nurse."
87626,87627,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.224,Nurse,"Faith, here it is."
87627,87628,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.225,Nurse,"Romeo is banish'd, and all the world to nothing,"
87628,87629,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.226,Nurse,"That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you,"
87629,87630,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.227,Nurse,"Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth."
87630,87631,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.228,Nurse,"Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,"
87631,87632,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.229,Nurse,I think it best you married with the county.
87632,87633,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.230,Nurse,"O, he's a lovely gentleman!"
87633,87634,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.231,Nurse,"Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,"
87634,87635,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.232,Nurse,"Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye"
87635,87636,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.233,Nurse,"As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,"
87636,87637,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.234,Nurse,"I think you are happy in this second match,"
87637,87638,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.235,Nurse,"For it excels your first: or if it did not,"
87638,87639,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.236,Nurse,"Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were,"
87639,87640,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,3.5.237,Nurse,As living here and you no use of him.
87640,87641,Romeo and Juliet,62.0,3.5.238,JULIET,Speakest thou from thy heart?
87641,87642,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,3.5.239,Nurse,"And from my soul too,"
87642,87643,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,3.5.240,Nurse,Or else beshrew them both.
87643,87644,Romeo and Juliet,64.0,3.5.241,JULIET,Amen!
87644,87645,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,3.5.242,Nurse,What?
87645,87646,Romeo and Juliet,66.0,3.5.243,JULIET,"Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much."
87646,87647,Romeo and Juliet,66.0,3.5.244,JULIET,"Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,"
87647,87648,Romeo and Juliet,66.0,3.5.245,JULIET,"Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,"
87648,87649,Romeo and Juliet,66.0,3.5.246,JULIET,To make confession and to be absolved.
87649,87650,Romeo and Juliet,67.0,3.5.247,Nurse,"Marry, I will, and this is wisely done."
87650,87651,Romeo and Juliet,67.0,,Nurse,Exit
87651,87652,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.248,JULIET,Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
87652,87653,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.249,JULIET,"Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,"
87653,87654,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.250,JULIET,Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
87654,87655,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.251,JULIET,Which she hath praised him with above compare
87655,87656,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.252,JULIET,"So many thousand times? Go, counsellor,"
87656,87657,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.253,JULIET,Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
87657,87658,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.254,JULIET,"I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:"
87658,87659,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,3.5.255,JULIET,"If all else fail, myself have power to die."

87661,87662,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,,JULIET,SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
87662,87663,Romeo and Juliet,68.0,,JULIET,Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
87663,87664,Romeo and Juliet,1.0,4.1.1,FRIAR LAURENCE,"On Thursday, sir? the time is very short."
87664,87665,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,4.1.2,PARIS,"My father Capulet will have it so,"
87665,87666,Romeo and Juliet,2.0,4.1.3,PARIS,And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
87666,87667,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,4.1.4,FRIAR LAURENCE,You say you do not know the lady's mind:
87667,87668,Romeo and Juliet,3.0,4.1.5,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Uneven is the course, I like it not."
87668,87669,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.6,PARIS,"Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,"
87669,87670,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.7,PARIS,"And therefore have I little talk'd of love,"
87670,87671,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.8,PARIS,For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
87671,87672,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.9,PARIS,"Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous"
87672,87673,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.10,PARIS,"That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,"
87673,87674,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.11,PARIS,"And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,"
87674,87675,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.12,PARIS,"To stop the inundation of her tears,"
87675,87676,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.13,PARIS,"Which, too much minded by herself alone,"
87676,87677,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.14,PARIS,May be put from her by society:
87677,87678,Romeo and Juliet,4.0,4.1.15,PARIS,Now do you know the reason of this haste.
87678,87679,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,4.1.16,FRIAR LAURENCE,[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
87679,87680,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,4.1.17,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell."
87680,87681,Romeo and Juliet,5.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Enter JULIET
87681,87682,Romeo and Juliet,6.0,4.1.18,PARIS,"Happily met, my lady and my wife!"
87682,87683,Romeo and Juliet,7.0,4.1.19,JULIET,"That may be, sir, when I may be a wife."
87683,87684,Romeo and Juliet,8.0,4.1.20,PARIS,"That may be must be, love, on Thursday next."
87684,87685,Romeo and Juliet,9.0,4.1.21,JULIET,What must be shall be.
87685,87686,Romeo and Juliet,10.0,4.1.22,FRIAR LAURENCE,That's a certain text.
87686,87687,Romeo and Juliet,11.0,4.1.23,PARIS,Come you to make confession to this father?
87687,87688,Romeo and Juliet,12.0,4.1.24,JULIET,"To answer that, I should confess to you."
87688,87689,Romeo and Juliet,13.0,4.1.25,PARIS,Do not deny to him that you love me.
87689,87690,Romeo and Juliet,14.0,4.1.26,JULIET,I will confess to you that I love him.
87690,87691,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,4.1.27,PARIS,"So will ye, I am sure, that you love me."
87691,87692,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,4.1.28,JULIET,"If I do so, it will be of more price,"
87692,87693,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,4.1.29,JULIET,"Being spoke behind your back, than to your face."
87693,87694,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,4.1.30,PARIS,"Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears."
87694,87695,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,4.1.31,JULIET,"The tears have got small victory by that,"
87695,87696,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,4.1.32,JULIET,For it was bad enough before their spite.
87696,87697,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,4.1.33,PARIS,"Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report."
87697,87698,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,4.1.34,JULIET,"That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,"
87698,87699,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,4.1.35,JULIET,"And what I spake, I spake it to my face."
87699,87700,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,4.1.36,PARIS,"Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it."
87700,87701,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,4.1.37,JULIET,"It may be so, for it is not mine own."
87701,87702,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,4.1.38,JULIET,"Are you at leisure, holy father, now,"
87702,87703,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,4.1.39,JULIET,Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
87703,87704,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,4.1.40,FRIAR LAURENCE,"My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now."
87704,87705,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,4.1.41,FRIAR LAURENCE,"My lord, we must entreat the time alone."
87705,87706,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,4.1.42,PARIS,God shield I should disturb devotion!
87706,87707,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,4.1.43,PARIS,"Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:"
87707,87708,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,4.1.44,PARIS,"Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss."
87708,87709,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,,PARIS,Exit
87709,87710,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,4.1.45,JULIET,"O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,"
87710,87711,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,4.1.46,JULIET,"Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!"
87711,87712,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,4.1.47,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief,"
87712,87713,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,4.1.48,FRIAR LAURENCE,It strains me past the compass of my wits:
87713,87714,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,4.1.49,FRIAR LAURENCE,"I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,"
87714,87715,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,4.1.50,FRIAR LAURENCE,On Thursday next be married to this county.
87715,87716,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.51,JULIET,"Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,"
87716,87717,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.52,JULIET,Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
87717,87718,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.53,JULIET,"If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,"
87718,87719,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.54,JULIET,"Do thou but call my resolution wise,"
87719,87720,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.55,JULIET,And with this knife I'll help it presently.
87720,87721,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.56,JULIET,"God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands,"
87721,87722,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.57,JULIET,"And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,"
87722,87723,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.58,JULIET,"Shall be the label to another deed,"
87723,87724,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.59,JULIET,Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
87724,87725,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.60,JULIET,"Turn to another, this shall slay them both:"
87725,87726,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.61,JULIET,"Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,"
87726,87727,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.62,JULIET,"Give me some present counsel, or, behold,"
87727,87728,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.63,JULIET,'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
87728,87729,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.64,JULIET,"Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that"
87729,87730,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.65,JULIET,Which the commission of thy years and art
87730,87731,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.66,JULIET,Could to no issue of true honour bring.
87731,87732,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.67,JULIET,"Be not so long to speak, I long to die,"
87732,87733,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,4.1.68,JULIET,If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
87733,87734,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.69,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,"
87734,87735,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.70,FRIAR LAURENCE,Which craves as desperate an execution.
87735,87736,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.71,FRIAR LAURENCE,As that is desperate which we would prevent.
87736,87737,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.72,FRIAR LAURENCE,"If, rather than to marry County Paris,"
87737,87738,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.73,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,"
87738,87739,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.74,FRIAR LAURENCE,Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
87739,87740,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.75,FRIAR LAURENCE,"A thing like death to chide away this shame,"
87740,87741,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.76,FRIAR LAURENCE,That copest with death himself to scape from it:
87741,87742,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,4.1.77,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy."
87742,87743,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.78,JULIET,"O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,"
87743,87744,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.79,JULIET,"From off the battlements of yonder tower,"
87744,87745,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.80,JULIET,"Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk"
87745,87746,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.81,JULIET,"Where serpents are, chain me with roaring bears,"
87746,87747,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.82,JULIET,"Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,"
87747,87748,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.83,JULIET,"O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,"
87748,87749,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.84,JULIET,"With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls,"
87749,87750,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.85,JULIET,Or bid me go into a new-made grave
87750,87751,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.86,JULIET,"And hide me with a dead man in his shroud,"
87751,87752,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.87,JULIET,"Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,"
87752,87753,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.88,JULIET,"And I will do it without fear or doubt,"
87753,87754,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,4.1.89,JULIET,To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
87754,87755,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.90,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Hold, then, go home, be merry, give consent"
87755,87756,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.91,FRIAR LAURENCE,To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
87756,87757,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.92,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,"
87757,87758,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.93,FRIAR LAURENCE,Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
87758,87759,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.94,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Take thou this vial, being then in bed,"
87759,87760,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.95,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And this distilled liquor drink thou off,"
87760,87761,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.96,FRIAR LAURENCE,When presently through all thy veins shall run
87761,87762,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.97,FRIAR LAURENCE,"A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse"
87762,87763,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.98,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:"
87763,87764,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.99,FRIAR LAURENCE,"No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest,"
87764,87765,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.100,FRIAR LAURENCE,The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
87765,87766,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.101,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,"
87766,87767,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.102,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Like death, when he shuts up the day of life,"
87767,87768,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.103,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Each part, deprived of supple government,"
87768,87769,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.104,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:"
87769,87770,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.105,FRIAR LAURENCE,And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
87770,87771,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.106,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,"
87771,87772,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.107,FRIAR LAURENCE,And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
87772,87773,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.108,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes"
87773,87774,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.109,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:"
87774,87775,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.110,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Then, as the manner of our country is,"
87775,87776,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.111,FRIAR LAURENCE,In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
87776,87777,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.112,FRIAR LAURENCE,Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
87777,87778,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.113,FRIAR LAURENCE,Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
87778,87779,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.114,FRIAR LAURENCE,"In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,"

87780,87781,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.116,FRIAR LAURENCE,And hither shall he come: and he and I
87781,87782,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.117,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Will watch thy waking, and that very night"
87782,87783,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.118,FRIAR LAURENCE,Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
87783,87784,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.119,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And this shall free thee from this present shame,"
87784,87785,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.120,FRIAR LAURENCE,"If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,"
87785,87786,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,4.1.121,FRIAR LAURENCE,Abate thy valour in the acting it.
87786,87787,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,4.1.122,JULIET,"Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!"
87787,87788,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,4.1.123,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Hold, get you gone, be strong and prosperous"
87788,87789,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,4.1.124,FRIAR LAURENCE,In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
87789,87790,Romeo and Juliet,32.0,4.1.125,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord."
87790,87791,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,4.1.126,JULIET,Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
87791,87792,Romeo and Juliet,33.0,4.1.127,JULIET,"Farewell, dear father!"

88032,88033,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,4.5.73,FRIAR LAURENCE,But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.

88355,88356,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.103,ROMEO,Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
88356,88357,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.104,ROMEO,"That unsubstantial death is amorous,"
88357,88358,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.105,ROMEO,And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
88358,88359,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.106,ROMEO,Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
88359,88360,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.107,ROMEO,"For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,"
88360,88361,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.108,ROMEO,And never from this palace of dim night
88361,88362,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.109,ROMEO,"Depart again: here, here will I remain"
88362,88363,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.110,ROMEO,"With worms that are thy chamber-maids, O, here"
88363,88364,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.111,ROMEO,"Will I set up my everlasting rest,"
88364,88365,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.112,ROMEO,And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
88365,88366,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.113,ROMEO,"From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!"
88366,88367,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.114,ROMEO,"Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you"
88367,88368,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.115,ROMEO,"The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss"
88368,88369,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.116,ROMEO,A dateless bargain to engrossing death!

88370,88371,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.118,ROMEO,"Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on"
88371,88372,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.119,ROMEO,The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!

88375,88376,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,5.3.122,ROMEO,Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
88376,88377,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,,ROMEO,Dies
88377,88378,Romeo and Juliet,15.0,,ROMEO,"Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade"

88379,88380,Romeo and Juliet,16.0,5.3.124,FRIAR LAURENCE,Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
88380,88381,Romeo and Juliet,17.0,5.3.125,BALTHASAR,"Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well."
88381,88382,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,5.3.126,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,"
88382,88383,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,5.3.127,FRIAR LAURENCE,"What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light"
88383,88384,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,5.3.128,FRIAR LAURENCE,"To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,"
88384,88385,Romeo and Juliet,18.0,5.3.129,FRIAR LAURENCE,It burneth in the Capel's monument.
88385,88386,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,5.3.130,BALTHASAR,"It doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,"
88386,88387,Romeo and Juliet,19.0,5.3.131,BALTHASAR,One that you love.
88387,88388,Romeo and Juliet,20.0,5.3.132,FRIAR LAURENCE,Who is it?
88388,88389,Romeo and Juliet,21.0,5.3.133,BALTHASAR,Romeo.
88389,88390,Romeo and Juliet,22.0,5.3.134,FRIAR LAURENCE,How long hath he been there?
88390,88391,Romeo and Juliet,23.0,5.3.135,BALTHASAR,Full half an hour.
88391,88392,Romeo and Juliet,24.0,5.3.136,FRIAR LAURENCE,Go with me to the vault.
88392,88393,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,5.3.137,BALTHASAR,"I dare not, sir"
88393,88394,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,5.3.138,BALTHASAR,"My master knows not but I am gone hence,"
88394,88395,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,5.3.139,BALTHASAR,"And fearfully did menace me with death,"
88395,88396,Romeo and Juliet,25.0,5.3.140,BALTHASAR,If I did stay to look on his intents.
88396,88397,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,5.3.141,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Stay, then, I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:"
88397,88398,Romeo and Juliet,26.0,5.3.142,FRIAR LAURENCE,"O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing."
88398,88399,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,5.3.143,BALTHASAR,"As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,"
88399,88400,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,5.3.144,BALTHASAR,"I dreamt my master and another fought,"
88400,88401,Romeo and Juliet,27.0,5.3.145,BALTHASAR,And that my master slew him.
88401,88402,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.146,FRIAR LAURENCE,Romeo!

88404,88405,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.148,FRIAR LAURENCE,The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
88405,88406,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.149,FRIAR LAURENCE,What mean these masterless and gory swords
88406,88407,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.150,FRIAR LAURENCE,To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
88407,88408,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,Enters the tomb
88408,88409,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.151,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?"
88409,88410,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.152,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour"
88410,88411,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.153,FRIAR LAURENCE,Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
88411,88412,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,5.3.154,FRIAR LAURENCE,The lady stirs.
88412,88413,Romeo and Juliet,28.0,,FRIAR LAURENCE,JULIET wakes
88413,88414,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,5.3.155,JULIET,O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
88414,88415,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,5.3.156,JULIET,"I do remember well where I should be,"
88415,88416,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,5.3.157,JULIET,And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
88416,88417,Romeo and Juliet,29.0,,JULIET,Noise within

88418,88419,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.159,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:"
88419,88420,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.160,FRIAR LAURENCE,A greater power than we can contradict
88420,88421,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.161,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away."
88421,88422,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.162,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,"
88422,88423,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.163,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee"
88423,88424,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.164,FRIAR LAURENCE,Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
88424,88425,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.165,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Stay not to question, for the watch is coming,"
88425,88426,Romeo and Juliet,30.0,5.3.166,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Come, go, good Juliet,"

88429,88430,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,,JULIET,Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
88430,88431,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,5.3.169,JULIET,"What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?"
88431,88432,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,5.3.170,JULIET,"Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:"
88432,88433,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,5.3.171,JULIET,"O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop"

88434,88435,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,5.3.173,JULIET,"Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,"
88435,88436,Romeo and Juliet,31.0,5.3.174,JULIET,To make die with a restorative.

88451,88452,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,5.3.185,First Watchman,Who here hath lain these two days buried.
88452,88453,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,5.3.186,First Watchman,"Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:"

88455,88456,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,5.3.189,First Watchman,But the true ground of all these piteous woes
88456,88457,Romeo and Juliet,35.0,5.3.190,First Watchman,We cannot without circumstance descry.

88463,88464,Romeo and Juliet,38.0,5.3.195,Third Watchman,As he was coming from this churchyard side.
88464,88465,Romeo and Juliet,39.0,5.3.196,First Watchman,A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

88532,88533,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.261,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight"
88533,88534,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.262,FRIAR LAURENCE,Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
88534,88535,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.263,FRIAR LAURENCE,"At the prefixed hour of her waking,"
88535,88536,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.264,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,"
88536,88537,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.265,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,"
88537,88538,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.266,FRIAR LAURENCE,Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
88538,88539,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.267,FRIAR LAURENCE,"But when I came, some minute ere the time"
88539,88540,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.268,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Of her awaking, here untimely lay"
88540,88541,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.269,FRIAR LAURENCE,The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
88541,88542,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.270,FRIAR LAURENCE,"She wakes, and I entreated her come forth,"
88542,88543,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.271,FRIAR LAURENCE,And bear this work of heaven with patience:
88543,88544,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.272,FRIAR LAURENCE,"But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,"
88544,88545,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.273,FRIAR LAURENCE,"And she, too desperate, would not go with me,"
88545,88546,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.274,FRIAR LAURENCE,"But, as it seems, did violence on herself."
88546,88547,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.275,FRIAR LAURENCE,"All this I know, and to the marriage"
88547,88548,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.276,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this"
88548,88549,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.277,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Miscarried by my fault, let my old life"
88549,88550,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.278,FRIAR LAURENCE,"Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,"
88550,88551,Romeo and Juliet,56.0,5.3.279,FRIAR LAURENCE,Unto the rigour of severest law.
88551,88552,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,5.3.280,PRINCE,We still have known thee for a holy man.
88552,88553,Romeo and Juliet,57.0,5.3.281,PRINCE,Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
88553,88554,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,5.3.282,BALTHASAR,"I brought my master news of Juliet's death,"
88554,88555,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,5.3.283,BALTHASAR,And then in post he came from Mantua
88555,88556,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,5.3.284,BALTHASAR,"To this same place, to this same monument."
88556,88557,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,5.3.285,BALTHASAR,"This letter he early bid me give his father,"
88557,88558,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,5.3.286,BALTHASAR,"And threatened me with death, going in the vault,"
88558,88559,Romeo and Juliet,58.0,5.3.287,BALTHASAR,I departed not and left him there.
88559,88560,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,5.3.288,PRINCE,"Give me the letter, I will look on it."
88560,88561,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,5.3.289,PRINCE,"Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?"
88561,88562,Romeo and Juliet,59.0,5.3.290,PRINCE,"Sirrah, what made your master in this place?"
88562,88563,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,5.3.291,PAGE,"He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave,"
88563,88564,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,5.3.292,PAGE,"And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:"
88564,88565,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,5.3.293,PAGE,"Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,"
88565,88566,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,5.3.294,PAGE,"And by and by my master drew on him,"
88566,88567,Romeo and Juliet,60.0,5.3.295,PAGE,And then I ran away to call the watch.
88567,88568,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.296,PRINCE,"This letter doth make good the friar's words,"
88568,88569,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.297,PRINCE,"Their course of love, the tidings of her death:"
88569,88570,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.298,PRINCE,And here he writes that he did buy a poison
88570,88571,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.299,PRINCE,"Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal"
88571,88572,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.300,PRINCE,"Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet."
88572,88573,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.301,PRINCE,Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
88573,88574,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.302,PRINCE,"See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,"
88574,88575,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.303,PRINCE,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
88575,88576,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.304,PRINCE,And I for winking at your discords too
88576,88577,Romeo and Juliet,61.0,5.3.305,PRINCE,Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
88577,88578,Romeo and Juliet,62.0,5.3.306,CAPULET,"O brother Montague, give me thy hand:"
88578,88579,Romeo and Juliet,62.0,5.3.307,CAPULET,"This is my daughter's jointure, for no more"
88579,88580,Romeo and Juliet,62.0,5.3.308,CAPULET,Can I demand.
88580,88581,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,5.3.309,MONTAGUE,But I can give thee more:
88581,88582,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,5.3.310,MONTAGUE,"For I will raise her statue in pure gold,"
88582,88583,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,5.3.311,MONTAGUE,"That while Verona by that name is known,"
88583,88584,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,5.3.312,MONTAGUE,There shall no figure at such rate be set
88584,88585,Romeo and Juliet,63.0,5.3.313,MONTAGUE,As that of true and faithful Juliet.
88585,88586,Romeo and Juliet,64.0,5.3.314,CAPULET,"As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,"
88586,88587,Romeo and Juliet,64.0,5.3.315,CAPULET,Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
88587,88588,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,5.3.316,PRINCE,"A glooming peace this morning with it brings,"
88588,88589,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,5.3.317,PRINCE,"The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:"
88589,88590,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,5.3.318,PRINCE,"Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things,"
88590,88591,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,5.3.319,PRINCE,"Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:"
88591,88592,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,5.3.320,PRINCE,For never was a story of more woe
88592,88593,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,5.3.321,PRINCE,Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
88593,88594,Romeo and Juliet,65.0,,PRINCE,Exeunt

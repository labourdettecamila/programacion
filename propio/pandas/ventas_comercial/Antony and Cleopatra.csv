18571,18572,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.1.4,PHILO,"Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,"
18572,18573,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.1.5,PHILO,The office and devotion of their view
18573,18574,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.1.6,PHILO,"Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,"
18574,18575,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.1.7,PHILO,Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst

18584,18585,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.1.16,MARK ANTONY,There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
18585,18586,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,1.1.17,CLEOPATRA,I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
18586,18587,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,1.1.18,MARK ANTONY,"Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth."

18591,18592,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.1.22,CLEOPATRA,"Fulvia perchance is angry, or, who knows"
18592,18593,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.1.23,CLEOPATRA,If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
18593,18594,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.1.24,CLEOPATRA,"His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this,"
18594,18595,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.1.25,CLEOPATRA,"Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that,"

18600,18601,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.1.31,CLEOPATRA,Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
18601,18602,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.1.32,CLEOPATRA,"Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,"
18602,18603,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.1.33,CLEOPATRA,"Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine"
18603,18604,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.1.34,CLEOPATRA,Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
18604,18605,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.1.35,CLEOPATRA,When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
18605,18606,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.1.36,MARK ANTONY,"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch"
18606,18607,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.1.37,MARK ANTONY,Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
18607,18608,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.1.38,MARK ANTONY,Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
18608,18609,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.1.39,MARK ANTONY,Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
18609,18610,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.1.40,MARK ANTONY,"Is to do thus, when such a mutual pair"

18613,18614,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.1.43,MARK ANTONY,We stand up peerless.
18614,18615,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,1.1.44,CLEOPATRA,Excellent falsehood!
18615,18616,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,1.1.45,CLEOPATRA,"Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?"
18616,18617,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,1.1.46,CLEOPATRA,"I'll seem the fool I am not, Antony"
18617,18618,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,1.1.47,CLEOPATRA,Will be himself.

18620,18621,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,1.1.50,MARK ANTONY,Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
18621,18622,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,1.1.51,MARK ANTONY,There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
18622,18623,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,1.1.52,MARK ANTONY,Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
18623,18624,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,1.1.53,CLEOPATRA,Hear the ambassadors.
18624,18625,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.54,MARK ANTONY,"Fie, wrangling queen!"
18625,18626,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.55,MARK ANTONY,"Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,"
18626,18627,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.56,MARK ANTONY,"To weep, whose every passion fully strives"
18627,18628,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.57,MARK ANTONY,"To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!"
18628,18629,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.58,MARK ANTONY,"No messenger, but thine, and all alone"
18629,18630,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.59,MARK ANTONY,To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
18630,18631,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.60,MARK ANTONY,"The qualities of people. Come, my queen,"
18631,18632,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.1.61,MARK ANTONY,Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.

18633,18634,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,1.1.62,DEMETRIUS,Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
18634,18635,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,1.1.63,PHILO,"Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,"
18635,18636,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,1.1.64,PHILO,He comes too short of that great property
18636,18637,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,1.1.65,PHILO,Which still should go with Antony.
18637,18638,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,1.1.66,DEMETRIUS,I am full sorry
18638,18639,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,1.1.67,DEMETRIUS,"That he approves the common liar, who"
18639,18640,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,1.1.68,DEMETRIUS,Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
18640,18641,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,1.1.69,DEMETRIUS,Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

18780,18781,Antony and Cleopatra,74.0,1.2.129,MARK ANTONY,There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:

18782,18783,Antony and Cleopatra,74.0,1.2.131,MARK ANTONY,"We wish it ours again, the present pleasure,"

18785,18786,Antony and Cleopatra,74.0,1.2.134,MARK ANTONY,The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
18786,18787,Antony and Cleopatra,74.0,1.2.135,MARK ANTONY,I must from this enchanting queen break off:

18788,18789,Antony and Cleopatra,74.0,1.2.137,MARK ANTONY,My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!

18791,18792,Antony and Cleopatra,76.0,1.2.139,MARK ANTONY,I must with haste from hence.
18792,18793,Antony and Cleopatra,77.0,1.2.140,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Why, then, we kill all our women:"
18793,18794,Antony and Cleopatra,77.0,1.2.141,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"we see how mortal an unkindness is to them,"

18795,18796,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,1.2.143,MARK ANTONY,I must be gone.

18799,18800,Antony and Cleopatra,79.0,1.2.147,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of"

18801,18802,Antony and Cleopatra,79.0,1.2.149,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
18802,18803,Antony and Cleopatra,79.0,1.2.150,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon"
18803,18804,Antony and Cleopatra,79.0,1.2.151,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"her, she hath such a celerity in dying."
18804,18805,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,1.2.152,MARK ANTONY,She is cunning past man's thought.

18807,18808,Antony and Cleopatra,81.0,1.2.154,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
18808,18809,Antony and Cleopatra,81.0,1.2.155,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"winds and waters sighs and tears, they are greater"
18809,18810,Antony and Cleopatra,81.0,1.2.156,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
18810,18811,Antony and Cleopatra,81.0,1.2.157,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"cannot be cunning in her, if it be, she makes a"
18811,18812,Antony and Cleopatra,81.0,1.2.158,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,shower of rain as well as Jove.
18812,18813,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,1.2.159,MARK ANTONY,Would I had never seen her.
18813,18814,Antony and Cleopatra,83.0,1.2.160,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece"
18814,18815,Antony and Cleopatra,83.0,1.2.161,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"of work, which not to have been blest withal would"
18815,18816,Antony and Cleopatra,83.0,1.2.162,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,have discredited your travel.
18816,18817,Antony and Cleopatra,84.0,1.2.163,MARK ANTONY,Fulvia is dead.
18817,18818,Antony and Cleopatra,85.0,1.2.164,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Sir?

18821,18822,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.168,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When"
18822,18823,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.169,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
18823,18824,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.170,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth,"
18824,18825,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.171,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"comforting therein, that when old robes are worn"
18825,18826,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.172,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"out, there are members to make new. If there were"
18826,18827,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.173,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,"
18827,18828,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.174,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned

18829,18830,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.176,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
18830,18831,Antony and Cleopatra,89.0,1.2.177,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,that should water this sorrow.
18831,18832,Antony and Cleopatra,90.0,1.2.178,MARK ANTONY,The business she hath broached in the state
18832,18833,Antony and Cleopatra,90.0,1.2.179,MARK ANTONY,Cannot endure my absence.
18833,18834,Antony and Cleopatra,91.0,1.2.180,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And the business you have broached here cannot be

18835,18836,Antony and Cleopatra,91.0,1.2.182,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,wholly depends on your abode.
18836,18837,Antony and Cleopatra,92.0,1.2.183,MARK ANTONY,No more light answers. Let our officers

18908,18909,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,1.3.46,CLEOPATRA,"Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,"
18909,18910,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,1.3.47,CLEOPATRA,Art turn'd the greatest liar.

18927,18928,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,1.3.65,MARK ANTONY,"And that which most with you should safe my going,"
18928,18929,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,1.3.66,MARK ANTONY,Is Fulvia's death.
18929,18930,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,1.3.67,CLEOPATRA,"Though age from folly could not give me freedom,"
18930,18931,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,1.3.68,CLEOPATRA,It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
18931,18932,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,1.3.69,MARK ANTONY,"She's dead, my queen:"
18932,18933,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,1.3.70,MARK ANTONY,"Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read"
18933,18934,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,1.3.71,MARK ANTONY,"The garboils she awaked, at the last, best:"
18934,18935,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,1.3.72,MARK ANTONY,See when and where she died.
18935,18936,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,1.3.73,CLEOPATRA,O most false love!
18936,18937,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,1.3.74,CLEOPATRA,Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
18937,18938,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,1.3.75,CLEOPATRA,"With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,"
18938,18939,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,1.3.76,CLEOPATRA,"In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be."
18939,18940,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,1.3.77,MARK ANTONY,"Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know"
18940,18941,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,1.3.78,MARK ANTONY,"The purposes I bear, which are, or cease,"
18941,18942,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,1.3.79,MARK ANTONY,As you shall give the advice. By the fire
18942,18943,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,1.3.80,MARK ANTONY,"That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence"
18943,18944,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,1.3.81,MARK ANTONY,"Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war"
18944,18945,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,1.3.82,MARK ANTONY,As thou affect'st.
18945,18946,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,1.3.83,CLEOPATRA,"Cut my lace, Charmian, come,"
18946,18947,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,1.3.84,CLEOPATRA,"But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,"
18947,18948,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,1.3.85,CLEOPATRA,So Antony loves.
18948,18949,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,1.3.86,MARK ANTONY,"My precious queen, forbear,"
18949,18950,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,1.3.87,MARK ANTONY,"And give true evidence to his love, which stands"
18950,18951,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,1.3.88,MARK ANTONY,An honourable trial.
18951,18952,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.3.89,CLEOPATRA,So Fulvia told me.
18952,18953,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.3.90,CLEOPATRA,"I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,"
18953,18954,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.3.91,CLEOPATRA,"Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears"
18954,18955,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.3.92,CLEOPATRA,"Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene"
18955,18956,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.3.93,CLEOPATRA,"Of excellent dissembling, and let it look"
18956,18957,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.3.94,CLEOPATRA,Life perfect honour.
18957,18958,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,1.3.95,MARK ANTONY,You'll heat my blood: no more.
18958,18959,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,1.3.96,CLEOPATRA,"You can do better yet, but this is meetly."
18959,18960,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,1.3.97,MARK ANTONY,"Now, by my sword,--"
18960,18961,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,1.3.98,CLEOPATRA,"And target. Still he mends,"
18961,18962,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,1.3.99,CLEOPATRA,"But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,"
18962,18963,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,1.3.100,CLEOPATRA,How this Herculean Roman does become
18963,18964,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,1.3.101,CLEOPATRA,The carriage of his chafe.
18964,18965,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,1.3.102,MARK ANTONY,"I'll leave you, lady."
18965,18966,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,1.3.103,CLEOPATRA,"Courteous lord, one word."
18966,18967,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,1.3.104,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:"
18967,18968,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,1.3.105,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it,"
18968,18969,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,1.3.106,CLEOPATRA,"That you know well: something it is I would,"
18969,18970,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,1.3.107,CLEOPATRA,"O, my oblivion is a very Antony,"
18970,18971,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,1.3.108,CLEOPATRA,And I am all forgotten.
18971,18972,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,1.3.109,MARK ANTONY,But that your royalty
18972,18973,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,1.3.110,MARK ANTONY,"Holds idleness your subject, I should take you"
18973,18974,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,1.3.111,MARK ANTONY,For idleness itself.
18974,18975,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.112,CLEOPATRA,'Tis sweating labour
18975,18976,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.113,CLEOPATRA,To bear such idleness so near the heart
18976,18977,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.114,CLEOPATRA,"As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,"
18977,18978,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.115,CLEOPATRA,"Since my becomings kill me, when they do not"
18978,18979,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.116,CLEOPATRA,"Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence,"
18979,18980,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.117,CLEOPATRA,Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
18980,18981,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.118,CLEOPATRA,And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
18981,18982,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.119,CLEOPATRA,Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
18982,18983,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,1.3.120,CLEOPATRA,Be strew'd before your feet!
18983,18984,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,1.3.121,MARK ANTONY,"Let us go. Come,"
18984,18985,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,1.3.122,MARK ANTONY,"Our separation so abides, and flies,"
18985,18986,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,1.3.123,MARK ANTONY,"That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,"
18986,18987,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,1.3.124,MARK ANTONY,"And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!"

18990,18991,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,"
18991,18992,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
18992,18993,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.3,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Our great competitor: from Alexandria
18993,18994,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes"
18994,18995,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.5,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The lamps of night in revel, is not more man-like"
18995,18996,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.6,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy"
18996,18997,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.7,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"More womanly than he, hardly gave audience, or"
18997,18998,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.8,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
18998,18999,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.9,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,A man who is the abstract of all faults
18999,19000,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,1.4.10,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,That all men follow.
19000,19001,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,1.4.11,LEPIDUS,I must not think there are
19001,19002,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,1.4.12,LEPIDUS,Evils enow to darken all his goodness:

19003,19004,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,1.4.14,LEPIDUS,"More fiery by night's blackness, hereditary,"
19004,19005,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,1.4.15,LEPIDUS,"Rather than purchased, what he cannot change,"
19005,19006,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,1.4.16,LEPIDUS,Than what he chooses.
19006,19007,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.17,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not"
19007,19008,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.18,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,"
19008,19009,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.19,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit"
19009,19010,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.20,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,"
19010,19011,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.21,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet"
19011,19012,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.22,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
19012,19013,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.23,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"becomes him,--"
19013,19014,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.24,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,As his composure must be rare indeed
19014,19015,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.25,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony"
19015,19016,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.26,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"No way excuse his soils, when we do bear"
19016,19017,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.27,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd

19018,19019,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.29,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,"
19019,19020,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.30,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Call on him for't: but to confound such time,"
19020,19021,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.31,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud"
19021,19022,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.32,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid"
19022,19023,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.33,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,"
19023,19024,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.34,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,"
19024,19025,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,1.4.35,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And so rebel to judgment.
19025,19026,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Enter a Messenger

19028,19029,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,1.4.38,Messenger,"Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report"
19029,19030,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,1.4.39,Messenger,"How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,"
19030,19031,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,1.4.40,Messenger,And it appears he is beloved of those
19031,19032,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,1.4.41,Messenger,That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
19032,19033,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,1.4.42,Messenger,"The discontents repair, and men's reports"
19033,19034,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,1.4.43,Messenger,Give him much wrong'd.
19034,19035,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.44,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I should have known no less.
19035,19036,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.45,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It hath been taught us from the primal state,"
19036,19037,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.46,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That he which is was wish'd until he were,"
19037,19038,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.47,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,"
19038,19039,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.48,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,"
19039,19040,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.49,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,"
19040,19041,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.50,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,"
19041,19042,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,1.4.51,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To rot itself with motion.
19042,19043,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.52,Messenger,"Caesar, I bring thee word,"
19043,19044,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.53,Messenger,"Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,"

19045,19046,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.55,Messenger,With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
19046,19047,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.56,Messenger,"They make in Italy, the borders maritime"
19047,19048,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.57,Messenger,"Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:"
19048,19049,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.58,Messenger,"No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon"
19049,19050,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.59,Messenger,"Taken as seen, for Pompey's name strikes more"
19050,19051,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,1.4.60,Messenger,Than could his war resisted.
19051,19052,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.61,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Antony,"
19052,19053,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.62,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
19053,19054,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.63,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st"
19054,19055,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.64,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel"
19055,19056,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.65,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did famine follow, whom thou fought'st against,"
19056,19057,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.66,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Though daintily brought up, with patience more"
19057,19058,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.67,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
19058,19059,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.68,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle"
19059,19060,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.69,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
19060,19061,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.70,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The roughest berry on the rudest hedge,"
19061,19062,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.71,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,"
19062,19063,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.72,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The barks of trees thou browsed'st, on the Alps"
19063,19064,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.73,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,"
19064,19065,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.74,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Which some did die to look on: and all this--
19065,19066,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.75,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
19066,19067,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.76,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek"
19067,19068,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,1.4.77,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,So much as lank'd not.
19068,19069,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,1.4.78,LEPIDUS,'Tis pity of him.
19069,19070,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.4.79,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Let his shames quickly
19070,19071,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.4.80,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
19071,19072,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.4.81,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did show ourselves i' the field, and to that end"
19072,19073,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.4.82,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
19073,19074,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,1.4.83,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Thrives in our idleness.
19074,19075,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.4.84,LEPIDUS,"To-morrow, Caesar,"
19075,19076,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,1.4.85,LEPIDUS,I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly

19083,19084,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,1.4.93,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Doubt not, sir,"
19084,19085,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,1.4.94,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I knew it for my bond.

19105,19106,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,1.5.18,CLEOPATRA,Indeed!
19106,19107,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,1.5.19,MARDIAN,"Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing"
19107,19108,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,1.5.20,MARDIAN,But what indeed is honest to be done:
19108,19109,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,1.5.21,MARDIAN,"Yet have I fierce affections, and think"
19109,19110,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,1.5.22,MARDIAN,What Venus did with Mars.
19110,19111,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.23,CLEOPATRA,"O Charmian,"
19111,19112,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.24,CLEOPATRA,"Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?"
19112,19113,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.25,CLEOPATRA,Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
19113,19114,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.26,CLEOPATRA,"O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!"
19114,19115,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.27,CLEOPATRA,"Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?"
19115,19116,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.28,CLEOPATRA,"The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm"
19116,19117,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.29,CLEOPATRA,"And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,"
19117,19118,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.30,CLEOPATRA,Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
19118,19119,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.31,CLEOPATRA,For so he calls me: now I feed myself
19119,19120,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.32,CLEOPATRA,"With most delicious poison. Think on me,"
19120,19121,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.33,CLEOPATRA,"That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,"
19121,19122,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.34,CLEOPATRA,"And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,"
19122,19123,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.35,CLEOPATRA,"When thou wast here above the ground, I was"
19123,19124,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.36,CLEOPATRA,A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
19124,19125,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.37,CLEOPATRA,"Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow,"
19125,19126,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.38,CLEOPATRA,There would he anchor his aspect and die
19126,19127,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,1.5.39,CLEOPATRA,With looking on his life.
19127,19128,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,,CLEOPATRA,"Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR"
19128,19129,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,1.5.40,ALEXAS,"Sovereign of Egypt, hail!"
19129,19130,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,1.5.41,CLEOPATRA,How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
19130,19131,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,1.5.42,CLEOPATRA,"Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath"
19131,19132,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,1.5.43,CLEOPATRA,With his tinct gilded thee.
19132,19133,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,1.5.44,CLEOPATRA,How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
19133,19134,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,1.5.45,ALEXAS,"Last thing he did, dear queen,"
19134,19135,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,1.5.46,ALEXAS,"He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--"
19135,19136,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,1.5.47,ALEXAS,This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
19136,19137,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,1.5.48,CLEOPATRA,Mine ear must pluck it thence.
19137,19138,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.49,ALEXAS,"'Good friend,' quoth he,"
19138,19139,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.50,ALEXAS,"'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends"
19139,19140,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.51,ALEXAS,"This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot,"
19140,19141,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.52,ALEXAS,"To mend the petty present, I will piece"
19141,19142,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.53,ALEXAS,"Her opulent throne with kingdoms, all the east,"
19142,19143,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.54,ALEXAS,"Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,"
19143,19144,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.55,ALEXAS,"And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,"
19144,19145,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.56,ALEXAS,"Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke"
19145,19146,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,1.5.57,ALEXAS,Was beastly dumb'd by him.
19146,19147,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,1.5.58,CLEOPATRA,"What, was he sad or merry?"
19147,19148,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,1.5.59,ALEXAS,Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
19148,19149,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,1.5.60,ALEXAS,"Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry."
19149,19150,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.61,CLEOPATRA,"O well-divided disposition! Note him,"
19150,19151,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.62,CLEOPATRA,"Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man, but note him:"
19151,19152,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.63,CLEOPATRA,"He was not sad, for he would shine on those"
19152,19153,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.64,CLEOPATRA,"That make their looks by his, he was not merry,"
19153,19154,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.65,CLEOPATRA,Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
19154,19155,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.66,CLEOPATRA,"In Egypt with his joy, but between both:"
19155,19156,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.67,CLEOPATRA,"O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,"
19156,19157,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.68,CLEOPATRA,"The violence of either thee becomes,"
19157,19158,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,1.5.69,CLEOPATRA,So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
19158,19159,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,1.5.70,ALEXAS,"Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:"
19159,19160,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,1.5.71,ALEXAS,Why do you send so thick?
19160,19161,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,1.5.72,CLEOPATRA,Who's born that day
19161,19162,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,1.5.73,CLEOPATRA,"When I forget to send to Antony,"
19162,19163,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,1.5.74,CLEOPATRA,"Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian."
19163,19164,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,1.5.75,CLEOPATRA,"Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,"
19164,19165,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,1.5.76,CLEOPATRA,Ever love Caesar so?
19165,19166,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,1.5.77,CHARMIAN,O that brave Caesar!
19166,19167,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,1.5.78,CLEOPATRA,Be choked with such another emphasis!
19167,19168,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,1.5.79,CLEOPATRA,"Say, the brave Antony."
19168,19169,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,1.5.80,CHARMIAN,The valiant Caesar!
19169,19170,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,1.5.81,CLEOPATRA,"By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,"
19170,19171,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,1.5.82,CLEOPATRA,If thou with Caesar paragon again
19171,19172,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,1.5.83,CLEOPATRA,My man of men.
19172,19173,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,1.5.84,CHARMIAN,"By your most gracious pardon,"
19173,19174,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,1.5.85,CHARMIAN,I sing but after you.
19174,19175,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.5.86,CLEOPATRA,"My salad days,"
19175,19176,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.5.87,CLEOPATRA,"When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,"
19176,19177,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.5.88,CLEOPATRA,"To say as I said then! But, come, away,"
19177,19178,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.5.89,CLEOPATRA,Get me ink and paper:
19178,19179,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.5.90,CLEOPATRA,"He shall have every day a several greeting,"
19179,19180,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,1.5.91,CLEOPATRA,Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
19180,19181,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,,CLEOPATRA,Exeunt

19182,19183,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,,CLEOPATRA,SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.
19183,19184,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,,CLEOPATRA,"Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner"
19184,19185,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.1.1,POMPEY,"If the great gods be just, they shall assist"
19185,19186,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.1.2,POMPEY,The deeds of justest men.
19186,19187,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.1.3,MENECRATES,"Know, worthy Pompey,"
19187,19188,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.1.4,MENECRATES,"That what they do delay, they not deny."
19188,19189,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,2.1.5,POMPEY,"Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays"
19189,19190,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,2.1.6,POMPEY,The thing we sue for.
19190,19191,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.1.7,MENECRATES,"We, ignorant of ourselves,"
19191,19192,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.1.8,MENECRATES,"Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers"
19192,19193,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.1.9,MENECRATES,"Deny us for our good, so find we profit"
19193,19194,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.1.10,MENECRATES,By losing of our prayers.
19194,19195,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.11,POMPEY,I shall do well:
19195,19196,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.12,POMPEY,"The people love me, and the sea is mine,"
19196,19197,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.13,POMPEY,"My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope"
19197,19198,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.14,POMPEY,Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
19198,19199,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.15,POMPEY,"In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make"
19199,19200,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.16,POMPEY,No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
19200,19201,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.17,POMPEY,"He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,"
19201,19202,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.18,POMPEY,"Of both is flatter'd, but he neither loves,"
19202,19203,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.1.19,POMPEY,Nor either cares for him.
19203,19204,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,2.1.20,MENAS,Caesar and Lepidus
19204,19205,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,2.1.21,MENAS,Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
19205,19206,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,2.1.22,POMPEY,Where have you this? 'tis false.
19206,19207,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.1.23,MENAS,"From Silvius, sir."
19207,19208,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.24,POMPEY,"He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,"
19208,19209,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.25,POMPEY,"Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,"
19209,19210,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.26,POMPEY,"Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!"
19210,19211,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.27,POMPEY,"Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!"
19211,19212,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.28,POMPEY,"Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,"
19212,19213,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.29,POMPEY,"Keep his brain fuming, Epicurean cooks"
19213,19214,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.30,POMPEY,"Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,"
19214,19215,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.31,POMPEY,That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
19215,19216,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.32,POMPEY,Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
19216,19217,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,,POMPEY,Enter VARRIUS
19217,19218,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.1.33,POMPEY,"How now, Varrius!"
19218,19219,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,2.1.34,VARRIUS,This is most certain that I shall deliver:
19219,19220,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,2.1.35,VARRIUS,Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
19220,19221,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,2.1.36,VARRIUS,Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
19221,19222,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,2.1.37,VARRIUS,A space for further travel.
19222,19223,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.38,POMPEY,I could have given less matter
19223,19224,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.39,POMPEY,"A better ear. Menas, I did not think"
19224,19225,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.40,POMPEY,This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
19225,19226,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.41,POMPEY,For such a petty war: his soldiership
19226,19227,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.42,POMPEY,Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
19227,19228,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.43,POMPEY,"The higher our opinion, that our stirring"
19228,19229,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.44,POMPEY,Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
19229,19230,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.1.45,POMPEY,The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
19230,19231,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,2.1.46,MENAS,I cannot hope
19231,19232,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,2.1.47,MENAS,Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
19232,19233,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,2.1.48,MENAS,"His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar,"
19233,19234,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,2.1.49,MENAS,"His brother warr'd upon him, although, I think,"
19234,19235,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,2.1.50,MENAS,Not moved by Antony.
19235,19236,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.51,POMPEY,"I know not, Menas,"
19236,19237,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.52,POMPEY,How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
19237,19238,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.53,POMPEY,"Were't not that we stand up against them all,"
19238,19239,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.54,POMPEY,'Twere pregnant they should square between
19239,19240,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.55,POMPEY,"themselves,"
19240,19241,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.56,POMPEY,For they have entertained cause enough
19241,19242,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.57,POMPEY,To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
19242,19243,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.58,POMPEY,May cement their divisions and bind up
19243,19244,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.59,POMPEY,"The petty difference, we yet not know."
19244,19245,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.60,POMPEY,Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
19245,19246,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.61,POMPEY,Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
19246,19247,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.1.62,POMPEY,"Come, Menas."
19247,19248,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,,POMPEY,Exeunt
19248,19249,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,,POMPEY,SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.
19249,19250,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,,POMPEY,Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
19250,19251,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.2.1,LEPIDUS,"Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,"
19251,19252,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.2.2,LEPIDUS,"And shall become you well, to entreat your captain"
19252,19253,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.2.3,LEPIDUS,To soft and gentle speech.
19253,19254,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.2.4,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I shall entreat him
19254,19255,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.2.5,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,"
19255,19256,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.2.6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Let Antony look over Caesar's head
19256,19257,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.2.7,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,"
19257,19258,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.2.8,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,"
19258,19259,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.2.9,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I would not shave't to-day.
19259,19260,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,2.2.10,LEPIDUS,'Tis not a time
19260,19261,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,2.2.11,LEPIDUS,For private stomaching.
19261,19262,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.2.12,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Every time
19262,19263,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.2.13,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
19263,19264,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.2.14,LEPIDUS,But small to greater matters must give way.
19264,19265,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,2.2.15,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Not if the small come first.
19265,19266,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,2.2.16,LEPIDUS,Your speech is passion:
19266,19267,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,2.2.17,LEPIDUS,"But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes"
19267,19268,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,2.2.18,LEPIDUS,The noble Antony.
19268,19269,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,,LEPIDUS,Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
19269,19270,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.2.19,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And yonder, Caesar."
19270,19271,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA"
19271,19272,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.2.20,MARK ANTONY,"If we compose well here, to Parthia:"

19277,19278,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.2.26,LEPIDUS,"A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,"
19278,19279,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.2.27,LEPIDUS,May it be gently heard: when we debate
19279,19280,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.2.28,LEPIDUS,"Our trivial difference loud, we do commit"
19280,19281,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.2.29,LEPIDUS,"Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,"

19286,19287,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,2.2.35,MARK ANTONY,I should do thus.

19289,19290,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,2.2.37,MARK ANTONY,Thank you.
19290,19291,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.2.38,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Sit.
19291,19292,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,2.2.39,MARK ANTONY,"Sit, sir."
19292,19293,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,2.2.40,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nay, then."
19293,19294,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,2.2.41,MARK ANTONY,"I learn, you take things ill which are not so,"
19294,19295,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,2.2.42,MARK ANTONY,"Or being, concern you not."
19295,19296,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.2.43,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I must be laugh'd at,"
19296,19297,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.2.44,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If, or for nothing or a little, I"
19297,19298,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.2.45,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should say myself offended, and with you"
19298,19299,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.2.46,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Chiefly i' the world, more laugh'd at, that I should"
19299,19300,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.2.47,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Once name you derogately, when to sound your name"
19300,19301,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.2.48,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,It not concern'd me.
19301,19302,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.2.49,MARK ANTONY,"My being in Egypt, Caesar,"
19302,19303,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.2.50,MARK ANTONY,What was't to you?
19303,19304,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,2.2.51,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,No more than my residing here at Rome
19304,19305,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,2.2.52,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there"
19305,19306,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,2.2.53,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt"
19306,19307,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,2.2.54,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Might be my question.
19307,19308,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.2.55,MARK ANTONY,"How intend you, practised?"
19308,19309,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,2.2.56,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
19309,19310,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,2.2.57,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
19310,19311,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,2.2.58,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Made wars upon me, and their contestation"
19311,19312,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,2.2.59,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Was theme for you, you were the word of war."
19312,19313,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.60,MARK ANTONY,"You do mistake your business, my brother never"
19313,19314,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.61,MARK ANTONY,"Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it,"
19314,19315,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.62,MARK ANTONY,"And have my learning from some true reports,"
19315,19316,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.63,MARK ANTONY,That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
19316,19317,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.64,MARK ANTONY,"Discredit my authority with yours,"
19317,19318,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.65,MARK ANTONY,"And make the wars alike against my stomach,"
19318,19319,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.66,MARK ANTONY,Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
19319,19320,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.67,MARK ANTONY,"Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,"
19320,19321,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.68,MARK ANTONY,"As matter whole you have not to make it with,"
19321,19322,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.2.69,MARK ANTONY,It must not be with this.
19322,19323,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,2.2.70,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You praise yourself
19323,19324,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,2.2.71,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"By laying defects of judgment to me, but"
19324,19325,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,2.2.72,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You patch'd up your excuses.
19325,19326,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.73,MARK ANTONY,"Not so, not so,"
19326,19327,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.74,MARK ANTONY,"I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,"
19327,19328,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.75,MARK ANTONY,"Very necessity of this thought, that I,"
19328,19329,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.76,MARK ANTONY,"Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,"
19329,19330,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.77,MARK ANTONY,Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
19330,19331,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.78,MARK ANTONY,"Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,"
19331,19332,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.79,MARK ANTONY,I would you had her spirit in such another:
19332,19333,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.80,MARK ANTONY,"The third o' the world is yours, which with a snaffle"
19333,19334,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.2.81,MARK ANTONY,"You may pace easy, but not such a wife."
19334,19335,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,2.2.82,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Would we had all such wives, that the men might go"
19335,19336,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,2.2.83,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,to wars with the women!
19336,19337,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.2.84,MARK ANTONY,"So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar"
19337,19338,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.2.85,MARK ANTONY,"Made out of her impatience, which not wanted"
19338,19339,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.2.86,MARK ANTONY,"Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant"
19339,19340,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.2.87,MARK ANTONY,Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
19340,19341,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.2.88,MARK ANTONY,"But say, I could not help it."
19341,19342,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.2.89,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I wrote to you
19342,19343,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.2.90,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"When rioting in Alexandria, you"
19343,19344,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.2.91,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts"
19344,19345,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.2.92,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Did gibe my missive out of audience.
19345,19346,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.93,MARK ANTONY,"Sir,"
19346,19347,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.94,MARK ANTONY,He fell upon me ere admitted: then
19347,19348,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.95,MARK ANTONY,"Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want"
19348,19349,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.96,MARK ANTONY,Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
19349,19350,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.97,MARK ANTONY,"I told him of myself, which was as much"
19350,19351,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.98,MARK ANTONY,As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
19351,19352,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.99,MARK ANTONY,"Be nothing of our strife, if we contend,"
19352,19353,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.2.100,MARK ANTONY,Out of our question wipe him.
19353,19354,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,2.2.101,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You have broken
19354,19355,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,2.2.102,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The article of your oath, which you shall never"
19355,19356,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,2.2.103,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Have tongue to charge me with.
19356,19357,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,2.2.104,LEPIDUS,"Soft, Caesar!"
19357,19358,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.2.105,MARK ANTONY,"No,"
19358,19359,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.2.106,MARK ANTONY,"Lepidus, let him speak:"
19359,19360,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.2.107,MARK ANTONY,"The honour is sacred which he talks on now,"
19360,19361,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.2.108,MARK ANTONY,"Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar,"
19361,19362,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.2.109,MARK ANTONY,The article of my oath.
19362,19363,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,2.2.110,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To lend me arms and aid when I required them,"
19363,19364,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,2.2.111,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,The which you both denied.
19364,19365,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.112,MARK ANTONY,"Neglected, rather,"
19365,19366,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.113,MARK ANTONY,And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
19366,19367,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.114,MARK ANTONY,"From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,"
19367,19368,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.115,MARK ANTONY,I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
19368,19369,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.116,MARK ANTONY,"Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power"
19369,19370,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.117,MARK ANTONY,"Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,"
19370,19371,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.118,MARK ANTONY,"To have me out of Egypt, made wars here,"
19371,19372,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.119,MARK ANTONY,"For which myself, the ignorant motive, do"
19372,19373,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.120,MARK ANTONY,So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
19373,19374,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.2.121,MARK ANTONY,To stoop in such a case.
19374,19375,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,2.2.122,LEPIDUS,'Tis noble spoken.
19375,19376,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.2.123,MECAENAS,"If it might please you, to enforce no further"
19376,19377,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.2.124,MECAENAS,The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
19377,19378,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.2.125,MECAENAS,Were to remember that the present need
19378,19379,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.2.126,MECAENAS,Speaks to atone you.
19379,19380,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,2.2.127,LEPIDUS,"Worthily spoken, Mecaenas."
19380,19381,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,2.2.128,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Or, if you borrow one another's love for the"
19381,19382,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,2.2.129,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"instant, you may, when you hear no more words of"
19382,19383,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,2.2.130,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to"
19383,19384,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,2.2.131,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
19384,19385,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,2.2.132,MARK ANTONY,Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
19385,19386,Antony and Cleopatra,41.0,2.2.133,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
19386,19387,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,2.2.134,MARK ANTONY,"You wrong this presence, therefore speak no more."
19387,19388,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,2.2.135,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Go to, then, your considerate stone."
19388,19389,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.2.136,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I do not much dislike the matter, but"
19389,19390,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.2.137,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The manner of his speech, for't cannot be"
19390,19391,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.2.138,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"We shall remain in friendship, our conditions"
19391,19392,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.2.139,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
19392,19393,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.2.140,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge"
19393,19394,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.2.141,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,O' the world I would pursue it.
19394,19395,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,2.2.142,AGRIPPA,"Give me leave, Caesar,--"
19395,19396,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,2.2.143,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Speak, Agrippa."
19396,19397,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,2.2.144,AGRIPPA,"Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,"
19397,19398,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,2.2.145,AGRIPPA,Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
19398,19399,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,2.2.146,AGRIPPA,Is now a widower.
19399,19400,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,2.2.147,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Say not so, Agrippa:"
19400,19401,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,2.2.148,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof"
19401,19402,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,2.2.149,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Were well deserved of rashness.
19402,19403,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,2.2.150,MARK ANTONY,"I am not married, Caesar: let me hear"
19403,19404,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,2.2.151,MARK ANTONY,Agrippa further speak.
19404,19405,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.152,AGRIPPA,"To hold you in perpetual amity,"
19405,19406,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.153,AGRIPPA,"To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts"
19406,19407,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.154,AGRIPPA,"With an unslipping  knot, take Antony"
19407,19408,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.155,AGRIPPA,"Octavia to his wife, whose beauty claims"
19408,19409,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.156,AGRIPPA,"No worse a husband than the best of men,"
19409,19410,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.157,AGRIPPA,Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
19410,19411,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.158,AGRIPPA,"That which none else can utter. By this marriage,"
19411,19412,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.159,AGRIPPA,"All little jealousies, which now seem great,"
19412,19413,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.160,AGRIPPA,"And all great fears, which now import their dangers,"
19413,19414,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.161,AGRIPPA,"Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,"
19414,19415,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.162,AGRIPPA,Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
19415,19416,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.163,AGRIPPA,"Would, each to other and all loves to both,"
19416,19417,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.164,AGRIPPA,"Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke,"
19417,19418,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.165,AGRIPPA,"For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,"
19418,19419,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.2.166,AGRIPPA,By duty ruminated.
19419,19420,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,2.2.167,MARK ANTONY,Will Caesar speak?
19420,19421,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,2.2.168,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
19421,19422,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,2.2.169,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,With what is spoke already.
19422,19423,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,2.2.170,MARK ANTONY,"What power is in Agrippa,"
19423,19424,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,2.2.171,MARK ANTONY,"If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'"
19424,19425,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,2.2.172,MARK ANTONY,To make this good?
19425,19426,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,2.2.173,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The power of Caesar, and"
19426,19427,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,2.2.174,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,His power unto Octavia.
19427,19428,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.2.175,MARK ANTONY,May I never
19428,19429,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.2.176,MARK ANTONY,"To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,"
19429,19430,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.2.177,MARK ANTONY,Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
19430,19431,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.2.178,MARK ANTONY,Further this act of grace: and from this hour
19431,19432,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.2.179,MARK ANTONY,The heart of brothers govern in our loves
19432,19433,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.2.180,MARK ANTONY,And sway our great designs!
19433,19434,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,2.2.181,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,There is my hand.
19434,19435,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,2.2.182,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother"
19435,19436,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,2.2.183,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Did ever love so dearly: let her live
19436,19437,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,2.2.184,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never"
19437,19438,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,2.2.185,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Fly off our loves again!
19438,19439,Antony and Cleopatra,57.0,2.2.186,LEPIDUS,"Happily, amen!"
19439,19440,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.2.187,MARK ANTONY,"I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey,"
19440,19441,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.2.188,MARK ANTONY,For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
19441,19442,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.2.189,MARK ANTONY,"Of late upon me: I must thank him only,"
19442,19443,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.2.190,MARK ANTONY,"Lest my remembrance suffer ill report,"
19443,19444,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.2.191,MARK ANTONY,"At heel of that, defy him."
19444,19445,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.2.192,LEPIDUS,Time calls upon's:
19445,19446,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.2.193,LEPIDUS,"Of us must Pompey presently be sought,"
19446,19447,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.2.194,LEPIDUS,Or else he seeks out us.
19447,19448,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,2.2.195,MARK ANTONY,Where lies he?
19448,19449,Antony and Cleopatra,61.0,2.2.196,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,About the mount Misenum.
19449,19450,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,2.2.197,MARK ANTONY,What is his strength by land?
19450,19451,Antony and Cleopatra,63.0,2.2.198,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Great and increasing: but by sea
19451,19452,Antony and Cleopatra,63.0,2.2.199,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,He is an absolute master.
19452,19453,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.2.200,MARK ANTONY,So is the fame.
19453,19454,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.2.201,MARK ANTONY,Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
19454,19455,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.2.202,MARK ANTONY,"Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we"
19455,19456,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.2.203,MARK ANTONY,The business we have talk'd of.
19456,19457,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.2.204,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,With most gladness:
19457,19458,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.2.205,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And do invite you to my sister's view,"
19458,19459,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.2.206,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Whither straight I'll lead you.
19459,19460,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.2.207,MARK ANTONY,"Let us, Lepidus,"
19460,19461,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.2.208,MARK ANTONY,Not lack your company.
19461,19462,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,2.2.209,LEPIDUS,"Noble Antony,"
19462,19463,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,2.2.210,LEPIDUS,Not sickness should detain me.
19463,19464,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,,LEPIDUS,"Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS"
19464,19465,Antony and Cleopatra,68.0,2.2.211,MECAENAS,"Welcome from Egypt, sir."
19465,19466,Antony and Cleopatra,69.0,2.2.212,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My"
19466,19467,Antony and Cleopatra,69.0,2.2.213,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"honourable friend, Agrippa!"
19467,19468,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.2.214,AGRIPPA,Good Enobarbus!
19468,19469,Antony and Cleopatra,71.0,2.2.215,MECAENAS,We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
19469,19470,Antony and Cleopatra,71.0,2.2.216,MECAENAS,digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
19470,19471,Antony and Cleopatra,72.0,2.2.217,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ay, sir, we did sleep day out of countenance, and"
19471,19472,Antony and Cleopatra,72.0,2.2.218,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,made the night light with drinking.
19472,19473,Antony and Cleopatra,73.0,2.2.219,MECAENAS,"Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and"
19473,19474,Antony and Cleopatra,73.0,2.2.220,MECAENAS,"but twelve persons there, is this true?"
19474,19475,Antony and Cleopatra,74.0,2.2.221,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
19475,19476,Antony and Cleopatra,74.0,2.2.222,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting."
19476,19477,Antony and Cleopatra,75.0,2.2.223,MECAENAS,"She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to"
19477,19478,Antony and Cleopatra,75.0,2.2.224,MECAENAS,her.
19478,19479,Antony and Cleopatra,76.0,2.2.225,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up"
19479,19480,Antony and Cleopatra,76.0,2.2.226,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"his heart, upon the river of Cydnus."
19480,19481,Antony and Cleopatra,77.0,2.2.227,AGRIPPA,"There she appeared indeed, or my reporter devised"
19481,19482,Antony and Cleopatra,77.0,2.2.228,AGRIPPA,well for her.
19482,19483,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.229,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I will tell you.
19483,19484,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.230,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,"
19484,19485,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.231,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold,"
19485,19486,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.232,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Purple the sails, and so perfumed that"
19486,19487,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.233,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The winds were love-sick with them, the oars were silver,"
19487,19488,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.234,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made"
19488,19489,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.235,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The water which they beat to follow faster,"
19489,19490,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.236,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,"
19490,19491,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.237,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,It beggar'd all description: she did lie
19491,19492,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.238,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
19492,19493,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.239,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
19493,19494,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.240,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
19494,19495,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.241,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,"
19495,19496,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.242,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem"
19496,19497,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.243,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,"
19497,19498,Antony and Cleopatra,78.0,2.2.244,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And what they undid did.
19498,19499,Antony and Cleopatra,79.0,2.2.245,AGRIPPA,"O, rare for Antony!"
19499,19500,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.246,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,"
19500,19501,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.247,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,"
19501,19502,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.248,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And made their bends adornings: at the helm
19502,19503,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.249,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
19503,19504,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.250,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,"
19504,19505,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.251,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,That yarely frame the office. From the barge
19505,19506,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.252,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
19506,19507,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.253,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
19507,19508,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.254,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Her people out upon her, and Antony,"
19508,19509,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.255,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,"
19509,19510,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.256,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whistling to the air, which, but for vacancy,"
19510,19511,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.257,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,"
19511,19512,Antony and Cleopatra,80.0,2.2.258,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And made a gap in nature.
19512,19513,Antony and Cleopatra,81.0,2.2.259,AGRIPPA,Rare Egyptian!
19513,19514,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.260,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,"
19514,19515,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.261,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Invited her to supper: she replied,"
19515,19516,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.262,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"It should be better he became her guest,"
19516,19517,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.263,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,"
19517,19518,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.264,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,"
19518,19519,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.265,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,"
19519,19520,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.266,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And for his ordinary pays his heart
19520,19521,Antony and Cleopatra,82.0,2.2.267,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,For what his eyes eat only.
19521,19522,Antony and Cleopatra,83.0,2.2.268,AGRIPPA,Royal wench!
19522,19523,Antony and Cleopatra,83.0,2.2.269,AGRIPPA,She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
19523,19524,Antony and Cleopatra,83.0,2.2.270,AGRIPPA,"He plough'd her, and she cropp'd."
19524,19525,Antony and Cleopatra,84.0,2.2.271,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,I saw her once
19525,19526,Antony and Cleopatra,84.0,2.2.272,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Hop forty paces through the public street,"
19526,19527,Antony and Cleopatra,84.0,2.2.273,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,"
19527,19528,Antony and Cleopatra,84.0,2.2.274,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"That she did make defect perfection,"
19528,19529,Antony and Cleopatra,84.0,2.2.275,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And, breathless, power breathe forth."
19529,19530,Antony and Cleopatra,85.0,2.2.276,MECAENAS,Now Antony must leave her utterly.
19530,19531,Antony and Cleopatra,86.0,2.2.277,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Never, he will not:"
19531,19532,Antony and Cleopatra,86.0,2.2.278,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale"
19532,19533,Antony and Cleopatra,86.0,2.2.279,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Her infinite variety: other women cloy
19533,19534,Antony and Cleopatra,86.0,2.2.280,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
19534,19535,Antony and Cleopatra,86.0,2.2.281,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Where most she satisfies, for vilest things"
19535,19536,Antony and Cleopatra,86.0,2.2.282,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
19536,19537,Antony and Cleopatra,86.0,2.2.283,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Bless her when she is riggish.
19537,19538,Antony and Cleopatra,87.0,2.2.284,MECAENAS,"If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle"
19538,19539,Antony and Cleopatra,87.0,2.2.285,MECAENAS,"The heart of Antony, Octavia is"
19539,19540,Antony and Cleopatra,87.0,2.2.286,MECAENAS,A blessed lottery to him.
19540,19541,Antony and Cleopatra,88.0,2.2.287,AGRIPPA,Let us go.
19541,19542,Antony and Cleopatra,88.0,2.2.288,AGRIPPA,"Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest"

19827,19828,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,2.6.48,LEPIDUS,That's our offer.
19828,19829,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.49,POMPEY,"Know, then,"
19829,19830,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.50,POMPEY,I came before you here a man prepared
19830,19831,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.51,POMPEY,To take this offer: but Mark Antony
19831,19832,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.52,POMPEY,Put me to some impatience: though I lose
19832,19833,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.53,POMPEY,"The praise of it by telling, you must know,"
19833,19834,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.54,POMPEY,"When Caesar and your brother were at blows,"
19834,19835,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.55,POMPEY,Your mother came to Sicily and did find
19835,19836,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.6.56,POMPEY,Her welcome friendly.
19836,19837,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,2.6.57,MARK ANTONY,"I have heard it, Pompey,"
19837,19838,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,2.6.58,MARK ANTONY,And am well studied for a liberal thanks
19838,19839,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,2.6.59,MARK ANTONY,Which I do owe you.
19839,19840,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,2.6.60,POMPEY,Let me have your hand:
19840,19841,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,2.6.61,POMPEY,"I did not think, sir, to have met you here."
19841,19842,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,2.6.62,MARK ANTONY,"The beds i' the east are soft, and thanks to you,"
19842,19843,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,2.6.63,MARK ANTONY,"That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither,"
19843,19844,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,2.6.64,MARK ANTONY,For I have gain'd by 't.
19844,19845,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.6.65,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Since I saw you last,"
19845,19846,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.6.66,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,There is a change upon you.
19846,19847,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.6.67,POMPEY,"Well, I know not"
19847,19848,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.6.68,POMPEY,"What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face,"
19848,19849,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.6.69,POMPEY,"But in my bosom shall she never come,"
19849,19850,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.6.70,POMPEY,To make my heart her vassal.
19850,19851,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,2.6.71,LEPIDUS,Well met here.
19851,19852,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.6.72,POMPEY,"I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:"
19852,19853,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.6.73,POMPEY,"I crave our composition may be written,"
19853,19854,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.6.74,POMPEY,And seal'd between us.
19854,19855,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,2.6.75,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,That's the next to do.
19855,19856,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.6.76,POMPEY,"We'll feast each other ere we part, and let's"
19856,19857,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.6.77,POMPEY,Draw lots who shall begin.
19857,19858,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,2.6.78,MARK ANTONY,"That will I, Pompey."
19858,19859,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.6.79,POMPEY,"No, Antony, take the lot: but, first"
19859,19860,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.6.80,POMPEY,"Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery"
19860,19861,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.6.81,POMPEY,Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
19861,19862,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.6.82,POMPEY,Grew fat with feasting there.
19862,19863,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,2.6.83,MARK ANTONY,You have heard much.
19863,19864,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.6.84,POMPEY,"I have fair meanings, sir."
19864,19865,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.6.85,MARK ANTONY,And fair words to them.
19865,19866,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.6.86,POMPEY,Then so much have I heard:
19866,19867,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.6.87,POMPEY,"And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--"
19867,19868,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,2.6.88,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,No more of that: he did so.
19868,19869,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,2.6.89,POMPEY,"What, I pray you?"
19869,19870,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.6.90,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
19870,19871,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,2.6.91,POMPEY,"I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?"
19871,19872,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.6.92,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Well,"
19872,19873,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.6.93,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"And well am like to do, for, I perceive,"
19873,19874,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.6.94,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Four feasts are toward.
19874,19875,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,2.6.95,POMPEY,"Let me shake thy hand,"
19875,19876,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,2.6.96,POMPEY,"I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,"
19876,19877,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,2.6.97,POMPEY,When I have envied thy behavior.
19877,19878,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.6.98,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Sir,"
19878,19879,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.6.99,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I never loved you much, but I ha' praised ye,"
19879,19880,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.6.100,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,When you have well deserved ten times as much
19880,19881,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.6.101,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,As I have said you did.
19881,19882,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,2.6.102,POMPEY,"Enjoy thy plainness,"
19882,19883,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,2.6.103,POMPEY,It nothing ill becomes thee.
19883,19884,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,2.6.104,POMPEY,Aboard my galley I invite you all:
19884,19885,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,2.6.105,POMPEY,"Will you lead, lords?"
19885,19886,Antony and Cleopatra,41.0,2.6.106,LEPIDUS,"Show us the way, sir."
19886,19887,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,2.6.107,POMPEY,Come.
19887,19888,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,,POMPEY,Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
19888,19889,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,2.6.108,MENAS,"[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have"
19889,19890,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,2.6.109,MENAS,"made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir."
19890,19891,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.6.110,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"At sea, I think."
19891,19892,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,2.6.111,MENAS,"We have, sir."
19892,19893,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,2.6.112,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,You have done well by water.
19893,19894,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,2.6.113,MENAS,And you by land.
19894,19895,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,2.6.114,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I will praise any man that will praise me, though it"
19895,19896,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,2.6.115,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,cannot be denied what I have done by land.
19896,19897,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,2.6.116,MENAS,Nor what I have done by water.
19897,19898,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.6.117,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Yes, something you can deny for your own"
19898,19899,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.6.118,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
19899,19900,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,2.6.119,MENAS,And you by land.
19900,19901,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,2.6.120,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,There I deny my land service. But give me your
19901,19902,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,2.6.121,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they"
19902,19903,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,2.6.122,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,might take two thieves kissing.
19903,19904,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,2.6.123,MENAS,"All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are."
19904,19905,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,2.6.124,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
19905,19906,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.6.125,MENAS,"No slander, they steal hearts."
19906,19907,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,2.6.126,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,We came hither to fight with you.
19907,19908,Antony and Cleopatra,57.0,2.6.127,MENAS,"For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking."
19908,19909,Antony and Cleopatra,57.0,2.6.128,MENAS,Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
19909,19910,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.6.129,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again."
19910,19911,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.6.130,MENAS,"You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony"
19911,19912,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.6.131,MENAS,"here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?"
19912,19913,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,2.6.132,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
19913,19914,Antony and Cleopatra,61.0,2.6.133,MENAS,"True, sir, she was the wife of Caius Marcellus."
19914,19915,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,2.6.134,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
19915,19916,Antony and Cleopatra,63.0,2.6.135,MENAS,"Pray ye, sir?"
19916,19917,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.6.136,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,'Tis true.
19917,19918,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.6.137,MENAS,Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
19918,19919,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.6.138,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would"
19919,19920,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.6.139,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,not prophesy so.
19920,19921,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,2.6.140,MENAS,I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
19921,19922,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,2.6.141,MENAS,marriage than the love of the parties.
19922,19923,Antony and Cleopatra,68.0,2.6.142,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I think so too. But you shall find, the band that"
19923,19924,Antony and Cleopatra,68.0,2.6.143,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,seems to tie their friendship together will be the
19924,19925,Antony and Cleopatra,68.0,2.6.144,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
19925,19926,Antony and Cleopatra,68.0,2.6.145,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"holy, cold, and still conversation."
19926,19927,Antony and Cleopatra,69.0,2.6.146,MENAS,Who would not have his wife so?
19927,19928,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.6.147,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony."
19928,19929,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.6.148,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
19929,19930,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.6.149,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as"
19930,19931,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.6.150,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I said before, that which is the strength of their"
19931,19932,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.6.151,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,amity shall prove the immediate author of their
19932,19933,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.6.152,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
19933,19934,Antony and Cleopatra,70.0,2.6.153,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,he married but his occasion here.
19934,19935,Antony and Cleopatra,71.0,2.6.154,MENAS,"And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?"
19935,19936,Antony and Cleopatra,71.0,2.6.155,MENAS,I have a health for you.
19936,19937,Antony and Cleopatra,72.0,2.6.156,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt."
19937,19938,Antony and Cleopatra,73.0,2.6.157,MENAS,"Come, let's away."
19938,19939,Antony and Cleopatra,73.0,,MENAS,Exeunt
19939,19940,Antony and Cleopatra,73.0,,MENAS,"SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum."
19940,19941,Antony and Cleopatra,73.0,,MENAS,Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
19941,19942,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.7.1,First Servant,"Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are"
19942,19943,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.7.2,First Servant,ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
19943,19944,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,2.7.3,First Servant,will blow them down.
19944,19945,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,2.7.4,Second Servant,Lepidus is high-coloured.
19945,19946,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,2.7.5,First Servant,They have made him drink alms-drink.
19946,19947,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.7.6,Second Servant,"As they pinch one another by the disposition, he"
19947,19948,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.7.7,Second Servant,"cries out 'No more,' reconciles them to his"
19948,19949,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,2.7.8,Second Servant,"entreaty, and himself to the drink."
19949,19950,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.7.9,First Servant,But it raises the greater war between him and
19950,19951,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,2.7.10,First Servant,his discretion.
19951,19952,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,2.7.11,Second Servant,"Why, this is to have a name in great men's"
19952,19953,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,2.7.12,Second Servant,fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
19953,19954,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,2.7.13,Second Servant,me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
19954,19955,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,2.7.14,First Servant,"To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen"
19955,19956,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,2.7.15,First Servant,"to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,"
19956,19957,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,2.7.16,First Servant,which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
19957,19958,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,,First Servant,"A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK  ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains"
19958,19959,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.17,MARK ANTONY,"[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they, sir: they take"
19959,19960,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.18,MARK ANTONY,the flow o' the Nile
19960,19961,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.19,MARK ANTONY,"By certain scales i' the pyramid, they know,"
19961,19962,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.20,MARK ANTONY,"By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth"
19962,19963,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.21,MARK ANTONY,"Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,"
19963,19964,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.22,MARK ANTONY,"The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman"
19964,19965,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.23,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,"
19965,19966,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,2.7.24,MARK ANTONY,And shortly comes to harvest.
19966,19967,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,2.7.25,LEPIDUS,You've strange serpents there.
19967,19968,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,2.7.26,MARK ANTONY,"Ay, Lepidus."
19968,19969,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.7.27,LEPIDUS,Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
19969,19970,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,2.7.28,LEPIDUS,operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
19970,19971,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,2.7.29,MARK ANTONY,They are so.
19971,19972,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,2.7.30,POMPEY,"Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!"
19972,19973,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,2.7.31,LEPIDUS,"I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out."
19973,19974,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,2.7.32,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Not till you have slept, I fear me you'll be in till then."
19974,19975,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,2.7.33,LEPIDUS,"Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'"
19975,19976,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,2.7.34,LEPIDUS,"pyramises are very goodly things, without"
19976,19977,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,2.7.35,LEPIDUS,"contradiction, I have heard that."
19977,19978,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,2.7.36,MENAS,"[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word."
19978,19979,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,2.7.37,POMPEY,[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:
19979,19980,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,2.7.38,POMPEY,what is't?
19980,19981,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.7.39,MENAS,"[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat, I do beseech"
19981,19982,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.7.40,MENAS,"thee, captain,"
19982,19983,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,2.7.41,MENAS,And hear me speak a word.
19983,19984,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.7.42,POMPEY,[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.
19984,19985,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,2.7.43,POMPEY,This wine for Lepidus!
19985,19986,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,2.7.44,LEPIDUS,What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
19986,19987,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.7.45,MARK ANTONY,"It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad"
19987,19988,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.7.46,MARK ANTONY,"as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,"
19988,19989,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.7.47,MARK ANTONY,and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
19989,19990,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.7.48,MARK ANTONY,"which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of"
19990,19991,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,2.7.49,MARK ANTONY,"it, it transmigrates."
19991,19992,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,2.7.50,LEPIDUS,What colour is it of?
19992,19993,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,2.7.51,MARK ANTONY,Of it own colour too.
19993,19994,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,2.7.52,LEPIDUS,'Tis a strange serpent.
19994,19995,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,2.7.53,MARK ANTONY,'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
19995,19996,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,2.7.54,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Will this description satisfy him?
19996,19997,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.7.55,MARK ANTONY,"With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a"
19997,19998,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,2.7.56,MARK ANTONY,very epicure.
19998,19999,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.7.57,POMPEY,"[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of"
19999,20000,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.7.58,POMPEY,that? away!
20000,20001,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,2.7.59,POMPEY,Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
20001,20002,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.7.60,MENAS,[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thou
20002,20003,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.7.61,MENAS,"wilt hear me,"
20003,20004,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,2.7.62,MENAS,Rise from thy stool.
20004,20005,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,2.7.63,POMPEY,[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.
20005,20006,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,2.7.64,POMPEY,The matter?
20006,20007,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,,POMPEY,"Rises, and walks aside"
20007,20008,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,2.7.65,MENAS,I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
20008,20009,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.7.66,POMPEY,Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
20009,20010,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,2.7.67,POMPEY,"Be jolly, lords."
20010,20011,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,2.7.68,MARK ANTONY,"These quick-sands, Lepidus,"
20011,20012,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,2.7.69,MARK ANTONY,"Keep off them, for you sink."
20012,20013,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,2.7.70,MENAS,Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
20013,20014,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,2.7.71,POMPEY,What say'st thou?
20014,20015,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,2.7.72,MENAS,Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
20015,20016,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,2.7.73,POMPEY,How should that be?
20016,20017,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,2.7.74,MENAS,"But entertain it,"
20017,20018,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,2.7.75,MENAS,"And, though thou think me poor, I am the man"
20018,20019,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,2.7.76,MENAS,Will give thee all the world.
20019,20020,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,2.7.77,POMPEY,Hast thou drunk well?
20020,20021,Antony and Cleopatra,41.0,2.7.78,MENAS,"Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup."
20021,20022,Antony and Cleopatra,41.0,2.7.79,MENAS,"Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:"
20022,20023,Antony and Cleopatra,41.0,2.7.80,MENAS,"Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,"
20023,20024,Antony and Cleopatra,41.0,2.7.81,MENAS,"Is thine, if thou wilt ha't."
20024,20025,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,2.7.82,POMPEY,Show me which way.
20025,20026,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,2.7.83,MENAS,"These three world-sharers, these competitors,"
20026,20027,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,2.7.84,MENAS,"Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable,"
20027,20028,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,2.7.85,MENAS,"And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:"
20028,20029,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,2.7.86,MENAS,All there is thine.
20029,20030,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.87,POMPEY,"Ah, this thou shouldst have done,"
20030,20031,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.88,POMPEY,"And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany,"
20031,20032,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.89,POMPEY,"In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,"
20032,20033,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.90,POMPEY,"'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour,"
20033,20034,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.91,POMPEY,"Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue"
20034,20035,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.92,POMPEY,"Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,"
20035,20036,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.93,POMPEY,"I should have found it afterwards well done,"
20036,20037,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,2.7.94,POMPEY,"But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink."
20037,20038,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,2.7.95,MENAS,"[Aside]  For this,"
20038,20039,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,2.7.96,MENAS,I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
20039,20040,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,2.7.97,MENAS,"Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,"
20040,20041,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,2.7.98,MENAS,Shall never find it more.
20041,20042,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,2.7.99,POMPEY,This health to Lepidus!
20042,20043,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,2.7.100,MARK ANTONY,"Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey."
20043,20044,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,2.7.101,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Here's to thee, Menas!"
20044,20045,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,2.7.102,MENAS,"Enobarbus, welcome!"
20045,20046,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,2.7.103,POMPEY,Fill till the cup be hid.
20046,20047,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,2.7.104,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"There's a strong fellow, Menas."
20047,20048,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS
20048,20049,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,2.7.105,MENAS,Why?
20049,20050,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,2.7.106,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"A' bears the third part of the world, man, see'st"
20050,20051,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,2.7.107,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,not?
20051,20052,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,2.7.108,MENAS,"The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,"
20052,20053,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,2.7.109,MENAS,That it might go on wheels!
20053,20054,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,2.7.110,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Drink thou, increase the reels."
20054,20055,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,2.7.111,MENAS,Come.
20055,20056,Antony and Cleopatra,57.0,2.7.112,POMPEY,This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
20056,20057,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.7.113,MARK ANTONY,"It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?"
20057,20058,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,2.7.114,MARK ANTONY,Here is to Caesar!
20058,20059,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.7.115,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I could well forbear't.
20059,20060,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.7.116,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,"
20060,20061,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,2.7.117,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And it grows fouler.
20061,20062,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,2.7.118,MARK ANTONY,Be a child o' the time.
20062,20063,Antony and Cleopatra,61.0,2.7.119,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Possess it, I'll make answer:"
20063,20064,Antony and Cleopatra,61.0,2.7.120,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,But I had rather fast from all four days
20064,20065,Antony and Cleopatra,61.0,2.7.121,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Than drink so much in one.
20065,20066,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,2.7.122,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Ha, my brave emperor!"
20066,20067,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,To MARK ANTONY
20067,20068,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,2.7.123,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,"
20068,20069,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,2.7.124,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,And celebrate our drink?
20069,20070,Antony and Cleopatra,63.0,2.7.125,POMPEY,"Let's ha't, good soldier."
20070,20071,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.7.126,MARK ANTONY,"Come, let's all take hands,"
20071,20072,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.7.127,MARK ANTONY,Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
20072,20073,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,2.7.128,MARK ANTONY,In soft and delicate Lethe.
20073,20074,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.129,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,All take hands.
20074,20075,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.130,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
20075,20076,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.131,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing,"
20076,20077,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.132,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The holding every man shall bear as loud
20077,20078,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.133,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,As his strong sides can volley.
20078,20079,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
20079,20080,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.134,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,THE SONG.
20080,20081,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.135,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Come, thou monarch of the vine,"
20081,20082,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.136,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
20082,20083,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.137,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"In thy fats our cares be drown'd,"
20083,20084,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.138,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
20084,20085,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.139,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Cup us, till the world go round,"
20085,20086,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,2.7.140,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Cup us, till the world go round!"
20086,20087,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.141,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,"
20087,20088,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.142,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Let me request you off: our graver business
20088,20089,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.143,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part,"
20089,20090,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.144,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
20090,20091,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.145,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is weaker than the wine, and mine own tongue"
20091,20092,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.146,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
20092,20093,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.147,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
20093,20094,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,2.7.148,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Good Antony, your hand."
20094,20095,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,2.7.149,POMPEY,I'll try you on the shore.
20095,20096,Antony and Cleopatra,68.0,2.7.150,MARK ANTONY,"And shall, sir, give's your hand."

20115,20116,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,3.1.3,VENTIDIUS,Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
20116,20117,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,3.1.4,VENTIDIUS,"Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,"
20117,20118,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,3.1.5,VENTIDIUS,Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
20118,20119,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,3.1.6,SILIUS,"Noble Ventidius,"
20119,20120,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,3.1.7,SILIUS,"Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,"

20122,20123,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,3.1.10,SILIUS,The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony

20124,20125,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,3.1.12,SILIUS,Put garlands on thy head.
20125,20126,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.13,VENTIDIUS,"O Silius, Silius,"

20129,20130,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.17,VENTIDIUS,Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.

20136,20137,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.24,VENTIDIUS,"Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,"
20137,20138,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.25,VENTIDIUS,"The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,"
20138,20139,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.26,VENTIDIUS,Than gain which darkens him.
20139,20140,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.27,VENTIDIUS,"I could do more to do Antonius good,"
20140,20141,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.28,VENTIDIUS,"But 'twould offend him, and in his offence"
20141,20142,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,3.1.29,VENTIDIUS,Should my performance perish.

20145,20146,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,3.1.33,SILIUS,Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
20146,20147,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,3.1.34,VENTIDIUS,"I'll humbly signify what in his name,"
20147,20148,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,3.1.35,VENTIDIUS,"That magical word of war, we have effected,"

20149,20150,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,3.1.37,VENTIDIUS,The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
20150,20151,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,3.1.38,VENTIDIUS,We have jaded out o' the field.
20151,20152,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,3.1.39,SILIUS,Where is he now?
20152,20153,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,3.1.40,VENTIDIUS,"He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste"
20153,20154,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,3.1.41,VENTIDIUS,"The weight we must convey with's will permit,"

20160,20161,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,3.2.3,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps

20269,20270,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,3.3.21,Messenger,"Madam, I heard her speak, she is low-voiced."
20270,20271,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,3.3.22,CLEOPATRA,That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
20271,20272,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,3.3.23,CHARMIAN,Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
20272,20273,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,3.3.24,CLEOPATRA,"I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!"

20277,20278,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,3.3.29,Messenger,"She shows a body rather than a life,"
20278,20279,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,3.3.30,Messenger,A statue than a breather.
20279,20280,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,3.3.31,CLEOPATRA,Is this certain?
20280,20281,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,3.3.32,Messenger,Or I have no observance.

20284,20285,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,3.3.36,CLEOPATRA,I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
20285,20286,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,3.3.37,CLEOPATRA,The fellow has good judgment.
20286,20287,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,3.3.38,CHARMIAN,Excellent.

20293,20294,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,3.3.45,Messenger,Round even to faultiness.
20294,20295,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,3.3.46,CLEOPATRA,"For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so."

20296,20297,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,3.3.48,Messenger,"Brown, madam: and her forehead"
20297,20298,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,3.3.49,Messenger,As low as she would wish it.
20298,20299,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,3.3.50,CLEOPATRA,There's gold for thee.
20299,20300,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,3.3.51,CLEOPATRA,Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:

20308,20309,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,3.3.59,CHARMIAN,"Nothing, madam."

20312,20313,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,3.3.63,CLEOPATRA,"I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:"
20313,20314,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,3.3.64,CLEOPATRA,"But 'tis no matter, thou shalt bring him to me"
20314,20315,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,3.3.65,CLEOPATRA,Where I will write. All may be well enough.

20909,20910,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,3.13.88,THYREUS,My name is Thyreus.
20910,20911,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,3.13.89,CLEOPATRA,"Most kind messenger,"
20911,20912,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,3.13.90,CLEOPATRA,Say to great Caesar this: in deputation

20918,20919,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,3.13.97,THYREUS,"If that the former dare but what it can,"
20919,20920,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,3.13.98,THYREUS,No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
20920,20921,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,3.13.99,THYREUS,My duty on your hand.
20921,20922,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,3.13.100,CLEOPATRA,"Your Caesar's father oft,"
20922,20923,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,3.13.101,CLEOPATRA,"When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,"

20924,20925,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,3.13.103,CLEOPATRA,As it rain'd kisses.

20929,20930,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,3.13.107,THYREUS,"The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest"
20930,20931,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,3.13.108,THYREUS,To have command obey'd.

20936,20937,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,3.13.114,MARK ANTONY,And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am

20941,20942,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,3.13.118,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Than with an old one dying.
20942,20943,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,3.13.119,MARK ANTONY,Moon and stars!
20943,20944,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,3.13.120,MARK ANTONY,Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries

20945,20946,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,3.13.122,MARK ANTONY,"So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,"

20952,20953,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,3.13.129,MARK ANTONY,Bear us an errand to him.
20953,20954,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,,MARK ANTONY,Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS

20956,20957,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,3.13.132,MARK ANTONY,"Forborne the getting of a lawful race,"
20957,20958,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,3.13.133,MARK ANTONY,"And by a gem of women, to be abused"
20958,20959,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,3.13.134,MARK ANTONY,By one that looks on feeders?
20959,20960,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,3.13.135,CLEOPATRA,"Good my lord,--"
20960,20961,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,3.13.136,MARK ANTONY,You have been a boggler ever:
20961,20962,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,3.13.137,MARK ANTONY,But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
20962,20963,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,3.13.138,MARK ANTONY,"O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes,"
20963,20964,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,3.13.139,MARK ANTONY,"In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us"
20964,20965,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,3.13.140,MARK ANTONY,"Adore our errors, laugh at's, while we strut"
20965,20966,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,3.13.141,MARK ANTONY,To our confusion.
20966,20967,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,3.13.142,CLEOPATRA,"O, is't come to this?"
20967,20968,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,3.13.143,MARK ANTONY,I found you as a morsel cold upon
20968,20969,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,3.13.144,MARK ANTONY,"Dead Caesar's trencher, nay, you were a fragment"
20969,20970,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,3.13.145,MARK ANTONY,"Of Cneius Pompey's, besides what hotter hours,"
20970,20971,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,3.13.146,MARK ANTONY,"Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have"
20971,20972,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,3.13.147,MARK ANTONY,"Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,"
20972,20973,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,3.13.148,MARK ANTONY,"Though you can guess what temperance should be,"
20973,20974,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,3.13.149,MARK ANTONY,You know not what it is.
20974,20975,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,3.13.150,CLEOPATRA,Wherefore is this?
20975,20976,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.151,MARK ANTONY,To let a fellow that will take rewards
20976,20977,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.152,MARK ANTONY,And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
20977,20978,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.153,MARK ANTONY,"My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal"
20978,20979,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.154,MARK ANTONY,"And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were"
20979,20980,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.155,MARK ANTONY,"Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar"
20980,20981,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.156,MARK ANTONY,"The horned herd! for I have savage cause,"
20981,20982,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.157,MARK ANTONY,"And to proclaim it civilly, were like"
20982,20983,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.158,MARK ANTONY,A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
20983,20984,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.159,MARK ANTONY,For being yare about him.
20984,20985,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,,MARK ANTONY,Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
20985,20986,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,3.13.160,MARK ANTONY,Is he whipp'd?
20986,20987,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,3.13.161,First Attendant,"Soundly, my lord."
20987,20988,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,3.13.162,MARK ANTONY,Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
20988,20989,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,3.13.163,First Attendant,He did ask favour.
20989,20990,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.164,MARK ANTONY,"If that thy father live, let him repent"
20990,20991,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.165,MARK ANTONY,"Thou wast not made his daughter, and be thou sorry"
20991,20992,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.166,MARK ANTONY,"To follow Caesar in his triumph, since"
20992,20993,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.167,MARK ANTONY,Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
20993,20994,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.168,MARK ANTONY,"The white hand of a lady fever thee,"
20994,20995,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.169,MARK ANTONY,"Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,"
20995,20996,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.170,MARK ANTONY,"Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say"
20996,20997,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.171,MARK ANTONY,"He makes me angry with him, for he seems"
20997,20998,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.172,MARK ANTONY,"Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,"
20998,20999,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.173,MARK ANTONY,"Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry,"
20999,21000,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.174,MARK ANTONY,"And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,"
21000,21001,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.175,MARK ANTONY,"When my good stars, that were my former guides,"
21001,21002,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.176,MARK ANTONY,"Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires"
21002,21003,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.177,MARK ANTONY,Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
21003,21004,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.178,MARK ANTONY,"My speech and what is done, tell him he has"
21004,21005,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.179,MARK ANTONY,"Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom"
21005,21006,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.180,MARK ANTONY,"He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,"
21006,21007,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.181,MARK ANTONY,"As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:"
21007,21008,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,3.13.182,MARK ANTONY,"Hence with thy stripes, begone!"
21008,21009,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,,MARK ANTONY,Exit THYREUS
21009,21010,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,3.13.183,CLEOPATRA,Have you done yet?
21010,21011,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,3.13.184,MARK ANTONY,"Alack, our terrene moon"
21011,21012,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,3.13.185,MARK ANTONY,"Is now eclipsed, and it portends alone"
21012,21013,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,3.13.186,MARK ANTONY,The fall of Antony!
21013,21014,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,3.13.187,CLEOPATRA,I must stay his time.
21014,21015,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,3.13.188,MARK ANTONY,"To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes"
21015,21016,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,3.13.189,MARK ANTONY,With one that ties his points?
21016,21017,Antony and Cleopatra,57.0,3.13.190,CLEOPATRA,Not know me yet?
21017,21018,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,3.13.191,MARK ANTONY,Cold-hearted toward me?
21018,21019,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.192,CLEOPATRA,"Ah, dear, if I be so,"
21019,21020,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.193,CLEOPATRA,"From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,"
21020,21021,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.194,CLEOPATRA,"And poison it in the source, and the first stone"
21021,21022,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.195,CLEOPATRA,"Drop in my neck: as it determines, so"
21022,21023,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.196,CLEOPATRA,Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
21023,21024,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.197,CLEOPATRA,"Till by degrees the memory of my womb,"

21025,21026,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.199,CLEOPATRA,"By the discandying of this pelleted storm,"
21026,21027,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.200,CLEOPATRA,"Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile"
21027,21028,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,3.13.201,CLEOPATRA,Have buried them for prey!
21028,21029,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.202,MARK ANTONY,I am satisfied.
21029,21030,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.203,MARK ANTONY,"Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where"
21030,21031,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.204,MARK ANTONY,I will oppose his fate. Our force by land

21032,21033,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.206,MARK ANTONY,"Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like."
21033,21034,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.207,MARK ANTONY,"Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?"
21034,21035,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.208,MARK ANTONY,If from the field I shall return once more
21035,21036,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.209,MARK ANTONY,"To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood,"
21036,21037,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.210,MARK ANTONY,I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
21037,21038,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,3.13.211,MARK ANTONY,There's hope in't yet.
21038,21039,Antony and Cleopatra,61.0,3.13.212,CLEOPATRA,That's my brave lord!

21040,21041,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,3.13.214,MARK ANTONY,And fight maliciously: for when mine hours

21042,21043,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,3.13.216,MARK ANTONY,"Of me for jests, but now I'll set my teeth,"
21043,21044,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,3.13.217,MARK ANTONY,"And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,"

21049,21050,Antony and Cleopatra,63.0,3.13.223,CLEOPATRA,"Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra."
21050,21051,Antony and Cleopatra,64.0,3.13.224,MARK ANTONY,We will yet do well.
21051,21052,Antony and Cleopatra,65.0,3.13.225,CLEOPATRA,Call all his noble captains to my lord.

21054,21055,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,3.13.228,MARK ANTONY,"There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,"

21056,21057,Antony and Cleopatra,66.0,3.13.230,MARK ANTONY,Even with his pestilent scythe.

21058,21059,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,3.13.231,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,"
21059,21060,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,3.13.232,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood"
21060,21061,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,3.13.233,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,"The dove will peck the estridge, and I see still,"
21061,21062,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,3.13.234,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,A diminution in our captain's brain

21063,21064,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,3.13.236,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
21064,21065,Antony and Cleopatra,67.0,3.13.237,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,Some way to leave him.

21823,21824,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,4.15.77,CLEOPATRA,The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
21824,21825,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,4.15.78,CLEOPATRA,"Are level now with men, the odds is gone,"
21825,21826,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,4.15.79,CLEOPATRA,And there is nothing left remarkable
21826,21827,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,4.15.80,CLEOPATRA,Beneath the visiting moon.

21835,21836,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.88,CLEOPATRA,"No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded"
21836,21837,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.89,CLEOPATRA,By such poor passion as the maid that milks
21837,21838,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.90,CLEOPATRA,And does the meanest chares. It were for me
21838,21839,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.91,CLEOPATRA,"To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods,"
21839,21840,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.92,CLEOPATRA,To tell them that this world did equal theirs
21840,21841,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.93,CLEOPATRA,"Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught,"
21841,21842,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.94,CLEOPATRA,"Patience is scottish, and impatience does"

21843,21844,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.96,CLEOPATRA,"To rush into the secret house of death,"
21844,21845,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.97,CLEOPATRA,"Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?"
21845,21846,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.98,CLEOPATRA,"What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!"
21846,21847,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.99,CLEOPATRA,"My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,"
21847,21848,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.100,CLEOPATRA,"Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:"
21848,21849,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.101,CLEOPATRA,"We'll bury him, and then, what's brave,"
21849,21850,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.102,CLEOPATRA,"what's noble,"
21850,21851,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.103,CLEOPATRA,"Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,"
21851,21852,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.104,CLEOPATRA,"And make death proud to take us. Come, away:"
21852,21853,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.105,CLEOPATRA,This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
21853,21854,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.106,CLEOPATRA,"Ah, women, women! come, we have no friend"
21854,21855,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.107,CLEOPATRA,"But resolution, and the briefest end."
21855,21856,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,4.15.107,CLEOPATRA,"Exeunt, those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body"

21860,21861,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,5.1.2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks"
21861,21862,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,5.1.3,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,The pauses that he makes.
21862,21863,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,5.1.4,DOLABELLA,"Caesar, I shall."
21863,21864,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,,DOLABELLA,Exit
21864,21865,Antony and Cleopatra,2.0,,DOLABELLA,"Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY"
21865,21866,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,5.1.5,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
21866,21867,Antony and Cleopatra,3.0,5.1.6,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Appear thus to us?
21867,21868,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.7,DERCETAS,"I am call'd Dercetas,"
21868,21869,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.8,DERCETAS,"Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy"
21869,21870,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.9,DERCETAS,"Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,"
21870,21871,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.10,DERCETAS,"He was my master, and I wore my life"
21871,21872,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.11,DERCETAS,To spend upon his haters. If thou please
21872,21873,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.12,DERCETAS,"To take me to thee, as I was to him"
21873,21874,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.13,DERCETAS,"I'll be to Caesar, if thou pleasest not,"
21874,21875,Antony and Cleopatra,4.0,5.1.14,DERCETAS,I yield thee up my life.
21875,21876,Antony and Cleopatra,5.0,5.1.15,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,What is't thou say'st?
21876,21877,Antony and Cleopatra,6.0,5.1.16,DERCETAS,"I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead."
21877,21878,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,5.1.17,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,The breaking of so great a thing should make
21878,21879,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,5.1.18,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,A greater crack: the round world
21879,21880,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,5.1.19,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Should have shook lions into civil streets,"
21880,21881,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,5.1.20,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
21881,21882,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,5.1.21,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Is not a single doom, in the name lay"
21882,21883,Antony and Cleopatra,7.0,5.1.22,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,A moiety of the world.
21883,21884,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.23,DERCETAS,"He is dead, Caesar:"
21884,21885,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.24,DERCETAS,"Not by a public minister of justice,"
21885,21886,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.25,DERCETAS,"Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand,"
21886,21887,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.26,DERCETAS,"Which writ his honour in the acts it did,"
21887,21888,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.27,DERCETAS,"Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,"
21888,21889,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.28,DERCETAS,"Splitted the heart. This is his sword,"
21889,21890,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.29,DERCETAS,"I robb'd his wound of it, behold it stain'd"
21890,21891,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.1.30,DERCETAS,With his most noble blood.
21891,21892,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,5.1.31,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Look you sad, friends?"
21892,21893,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,5.1.32,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings"
21893,21894,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,5.1.33,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To wash the eyes of kings.
21894,21895,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,5.1.34,AGRIPPA,"And strange it is,"
21895,21896,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,5.1.35,AGRIPPA,That nature must compel us to lament
21896,21897,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,5.1.36,AGRIPPA,Our most persisted deeds.
21897,21898,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,5.1.37,MECAENAS,His taints and honours
21898,21899,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,5.1.38,MECAENAS,Waged equal with him.
21899,21900,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,5.1.39,AGRIPPA,A rarer spirit never
21900,21901,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,5.1.40,AGRIPPA,"Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us"
21901,21902,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,5.1.41,AGRIPPA,Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
21902,21903,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,5.1.42,MECAENAS,"When such a spacious mirror's set before him,"
21903,21904,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,5.1.43,MECAENAS,He needs must see himself.
21904,21905,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.44,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,O Antony!
21905,21906,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.45,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I have follow'd thee to this, but we do lance"
21906,21907,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.46,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
21907,21908,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.47,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Have shown to thee such a declining day,"
21908,21909,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.48,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Or look on thine, we could not stall together"
21909,21910,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.49,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In the whole world: but yet let me lament,"
21910,21911,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.50,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,"
21911,21912,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.51,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That thou, my brother, my competitor"
21912,21913,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.52,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In top of all design, my mate in empire,"
21913,21914,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.53,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Friend and companion in the front of war,"
21914,21915,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.54,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The arm of mine own body, and the heart"
21915,21916,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.55,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,"
21916,21917,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.56,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Unreconciliable, should divide"
21917,21918,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.57,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--"
21918,21919,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.58,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,But I will tell you at some meeter season:
21919,21920,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Enter an Egyptian
21920,21921,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.59,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The business of this man looks out of him,"
21921,21922,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.1.60,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
21922,21923,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.1.61,Egyptian,"A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,"
21923,21924,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.1.62,Egyptian,"Confined in all she has, her monument,"
21924,21925,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.1.63,Egyptian,"Of thy intents desires instruction,"
21925,21926,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.1.64,Egyptian,That she preparedly may frame herself
21926,21927,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.1.65,Egyptian,To the way she's forced to.
21927,21928,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.1.66,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Bid her have good heart:
21928,21929,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.1.67,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,"
21929,21930,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.1.68,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,How honourable and how kindly we
21930,21931,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.1.69,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live"
21931,21932,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.1.70,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,To be ungentle.
21932,21933,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,5.1.71,Egyptian,So the gods preserve thee!
21933,21934,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,,Egyptian,Exit
21934,21935,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.1.72,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,"

21936,21937,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.1.74,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The quality of her passion shall require,"
21937,21938,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.1.75,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke"
21938,21939,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.1.76,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She do defeat us, for her life in Rome"
21939,21940,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.1.77,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Would be eternal in our triumph: go,"
21940,21941,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.1.78,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And with your speediest bring us what she says,"
21941,21942,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.1.79,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And how you find of her.
21942,21943,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,5.1.80,PROCULEIUS,"Caesar, I shall."

21952,21953,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,5.1.88,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"How hardly I was drawn into this war,"
21953,21954,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,5.1.89,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,How calm and gentle I proceeded still

21955,21956,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,5.1.91,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,What I can show in this.

21961,21962,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,5.2.3,CLEOPATRA,"Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,"
21962,21963,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,5.2.4,CLEOPATRA,A minister of her will: and it is great
21963,21964,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,5.2.5,CLEOPATRA,"To do that thing that ends all other deeds,"
21964,21965,Antony and Cleopatra,1.0,5.2.6,CLEOPATRA,"Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,"

21997,21998,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.2.38,PROCULEIUS,"Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied"
21998,21999,Antony and Cleopatra,8.0,5.2.39,PROCULEIUS,Of him that caused it.
21999,22000,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,5.2.40,GALLUS,You see how easily she may be surprised:
22000,22001,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,,GALLUS,"Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,  having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates"
22001,22002,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,,GALLUS,To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
22002,22003,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,5.2.41,GALLUS,Guard her till Caesar come.
22003,22004,Antony and Cleopatra,9.0,,GALLUS,Exit
22004,22005,Antony and Cleopatra,10.0,5.2.42,IRAS,Royal queen!
22005,22006,Antony and Cleopatra,11.0,5.2.43,CHARMIAN,"O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:"
22006,22007,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,5.2.44,CLEOPATRA,"Quick, quick, good hands."
22007,22008,Antony and Cleopatra,12.0,,CLEOPATRA,Drawing a dagger
22008,22009,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,5.2.45,PROCULEIUS,"Hold, worthy lady, hold:"
22009,22010,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,,PROCULEIUS,Seizes and disarms her
22010,22011,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,5.2.46,PROCULEIUS,"Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this"
22011,22012,Antony and Cleopatra,13.0,5.2.47,PROCULEIUS,"Relieved, but not betray'd."
22012,22013,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.2.48,CLEOPATRA,"What, of death too,"
22013,22014,Antony and Cleopatra,14.0,5.2.49,CLEOPATRA,That rids our dogs of languish?
22014,22015,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.2.50,PROCULEIUS,"Cleopatra,"
22015,22016,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.2.51,PROCULEIUS,Do not abuse my master's bounty by
22016,22017,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.2.52,PROCULEIUS,The undoing of yourself: let the world see
22017,22018,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.2.53,PROCULEIUS,"His nobleness well acted, which your death"
22018,22019,Antony and Cleopatra,15.0,5.2.54,PROCULEIUS,Will never let come forth.
22019,22020,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.2.55,CLEOPATRA,"Where art thou, death?"
22020,22021,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.2.56,CLEOPATRA,"Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen"
22021,22022,Antony and Cleopatra,16.0,5.2.57,CLEOPATRA,Worthy many babes and beggars!
22022,22023,Antony and Cleopatra,17.0,5.2.58,PROCULEIUS,"O, temperance, lady!"
22023,22024,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.59,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir,"
22024,22025,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.60,CLEOPATRA,"If idle talk will once be necessary,"
22025,22026,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.61,CLEOPATRA,"I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,"
22026,22027,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.62,CLEOPATRA,"Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I"
22027,22028,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.63,CLEOPATRA,"Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court,"
22028,22029,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.64,CLEOPATRA,Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
22029,22030,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.65,CLEOPATRA,Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
22030,22031,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.66,CLEOPATRA,And show me to the shouting varletry
22031,22032,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.67,CLEOPATRA,Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
22032,22033,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.68,CLEOPATRA,Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
22033,22034,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.69,CLEOPATRA,"Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies"
22034,22035,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.70,CLEOPATRA,Blow me into abhorring! rather make
22035,22036,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.71,CLEOPATRA,"My country's high pyramides my gibbet,"
22036,22037,Antony and Cleopatra,18.0,5.2.72,CLEOPATRA,And hang me up in chains!
22037,22038,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,5.2.73,PROCULEIUS,You do extend
22038,22039,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,5.2.74,PROCULEIUS,These thoughts of horror further than you shall
22039,22040,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,5.2.75,PROCULEIUS,Find cause in Caesar.
22040,22041,Antony and Cleopatra,19.0,,PROCULEIUS,Enter DOLABELLA
22041,22042,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,5.2.76,DOLABELLA,"Proculeius,"
22042,22043,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,5.2.77,DOLABELLA,"What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,"
22043,22044,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,5.2.78,DOLABELLA,"And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,"
22044,22045,Antony and Cleopatra,20.0,5.2.79,DOLABELLA,I'll take her to my guard.
22045,22046,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,5.2.80,PROCULEIUS,"So, Dolabella,"
22046,22047,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,5.2.81,PROCULEIUS,It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
22047,22048,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,,PROCULEIUS,To CLEOPATRA
22048,22049,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,5.2.82,PROCULEIUS,"To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,"
22049,22050,Antony and Cleopatra,21.0,5.2.83,PROCULEIUS,If you'll employ me to him.
22050,22051,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,5.2.84,CLEOPATRA,"Say, I would die."
22051,22052,Antony and Cleopatra,22.0,,CLEOPATRA,Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers
22052,22053,Antony and Cleopatra,23.0,5.2.85,DOLABELLA,"Most noble empress, you have heard of me?"
22053,22054,Antony and Cleopatra,24.0,5.2.86,CLEOPATRA,I cannot tell.
22054,22055,Antony and Cleopatra,25.0,5.2.87,DOLABELLA,Assuredly you know me.
22055,22056,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,5.2.88,CLEOPATRA,"No matter, sir, what I have heard or known."
22056,22057,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,5.2.89,CLEOPATRA,"You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams,"
22057,22058,Antony and Cleopatra,26.0,5.2.90,CLEOPATRA,Is't not your trick?
22058,22059,Antony and Cleopatra,27.0,5.2.91,DOLABELLA,"I understand not, madam."
22059,22060,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,5.2.92,CLEOPATRA,I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
22060,22061,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,5.2.93,CLEOPATRA,"O, such another sleep, that I might see"
22061,22062,Antony and Cleopatra,28.0,5.2.94,CLEOPATRA,But such another man!
22062,22063,Antony and Cleopatra,29.0,5.2.95,DOLABELLA,"If it might please ye,--"
22063,22064,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,5.2.96,CLEOPATRA,"His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck"
22064,22065,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,5.2.97,CLEOPATRA,"A sun and moon, which kept their course,"
22065,22066,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,5.2.98,CLEOPATRA,and lighted
22066,22067,Antony and Cleopatra,30.0,5.2.99,CLEOPATRA,"The little O, the earth."
22067,22068,Antony and Cleopatra,31.0,5.2.100,DOLABELLA,"Most sovereign creature,--"
22068,22069,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.101,CLEOPATRA,His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
22069,22070,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.102,CLEOPATRA,Crested the world: his voice was propertied
22070,22071,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.103,CLEOPATRA,"As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends,"
22071,22072,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.104,CLEOPATRA,"But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,"
22072,22073,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.105,CLEOPATRA,"He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,"
22073,22074,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.106,CLEOPATRA,"There was no winter in't, an autumn 'twas"
22074,22075,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.107,CLEOPATRA,That grew the more by reaping: his delights
22075,22076,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.108,CLEOPATRA,"Were dolphin-like, they show'd his back above"
22076,22077,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.109,CLEOPATRA,The element they lived in: in his livery
22077,22078,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.110,CLEOPATRA,"Walk'd crowns and crownets, realms and islands were"
22078,22079,Antony and Cleopatra,32.0,5.2.111,CLEOPATRA,As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
22079,22080,Antony and Cleopatra,33.0,5.2.112,DOLABELLA,Cleopatra!
22080,22081,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,5.2.113,CLEOPATRA,"Think you there was, or might be, such a man"
22081,22082,Antony and Cleopatra,34.0,5.2.114,CLEOPATRA,As this I dream'd of?
22082,22083,Antony and Cleopatra,35.0,5.2.115,DOLABELLA,"Gentle madam, no."
22083,22084,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,5.2.116,CLEOPATRA,"You lie, up to the hearing of the gods."
22084,22085,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,5.2.117,CLEOPATRA,"But, if there be, or ever were, one such,"
22085,22086,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,5.2.118,CLEOPATRA,It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
22086,22087,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,5.2.119,CLEOPATRA,"To vie strange forms with fancy, yet, to imagine"
22087,22088,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,5.2.120,CLEOPATRA,"And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,"
22088,22089,Antony and Cleopatra,36.0,5.2.121,CLEOPATRA,Condemning shadows quite.
22089,22090,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,5.2.122,DOLABELLA,"Hear me, good madam."
22090,22091,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,5.2.123,DOLABELLA,"Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it"
22091,22092,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,5.2.124,DOLABELLA,As answering to the weight: would I might never
22092,22093,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,5.2.125,DOLABELLA,"O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,"
22093,22094,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,5.2.126,DOLABELLA,"By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites"
22094,22095,Antony and Cleopatra,37.0,5.2.127,DOLABELLA,My very heart at root.
22095,22096,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,5.2.128,CLEOPATRA,"I thank you, sir,"
22096,22097,Antony and Cleopatra,38.0,5.2.129,CLEOPATRA,Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
22097,22098,Antony and Cleopatra,39.0,5.2.130,DOLABELLA,I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
22098,22099,Antony and Cleopatra,40.0,5.2.131,CLEOPATRA,"Nay, pray you, sir,--"
22099,22100,Antony and Cleopatra,41.0,5.2.132,DOLABELLA,"Though he be honourable,--"
22100,22101,Antony and Cleopatra,42.0,5.2.133,CLEOPATRA,"He'll lead me, then, in triumph?"
22101,22102,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,5.2.134,DOLABELLA,"Madam, he will, I know't."
22102,22103,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,5.2.134,DOLABELLA,"Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'"
22103,22104,Antony and Cleopatra,43.0,,DOLABELLA,"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train"
22104,22105,Antony and Cleopatra,44.0,5.2.135,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Which is the Queen of Egypt?
22105,22106,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,5.2.136,DOLABELLA,"It is the emperor, madam."
22106,22107,Antony and Cleopatra,45.0,,DOLABELLA,CLEOPATRA kneels
22107,22108,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,5.2.137,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Arise, you shall not kneel:"
22108,22109,Antony and Cleopatra,46.0,5.2.138,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"I pray you, rise, rise, Egypt."
22109,22110,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,5.2.139,CLEOPATRA,"Sir, the gods"
22110,22111,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,5.2.140,CLEOPATRA,"Will have it thus, my master and my lord"
22111,22112,Antony and Cleopatra,47.0,5.2.141,CLEOPATRA,I must obey.
22112,22113,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,5.2.142,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Take to you no hard thoughts:
22113,22114,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,5.2.143,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"The record of what injuries you did us,"
22114,22115,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,5.2.144,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Though written in our flesh, we shall remember"
22115,22116,Antony and Cleopatra,48.0,5.2.145,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,As things but done by chance.
22116,22117,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,5.2.146,CLEOPATRA,"Sole sir o' the world,"
22117,22118,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,5.2.147,CLEOPATRA,I cannot project mine own cause so well
22118,22119,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,5.2.148,CLEOPATRA,"To make it clear, but do confess I have"
22119,22120,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,5.2.149,CLEOPATRA,Been laden with like frailties which before
22120,22121,Antony and Cleopatra,49.0,5.2.150,CLEOPATRA,Have often shamed our sex.
22121,22122,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.151,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Cleopatra, know,"
22122,22123,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.152,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,We will extenuate rather than enforce:
22123,22124,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.153,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If you apply yourself to our intents,"
22124,22125,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.154,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find"
22125,22126,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.155,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"A benefit in this change, but if you seek"
22126,22127,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.156,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To lay on me a cruelty, by taking"
22127,22128,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.157,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself"
22128,22129,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.158,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of my good purposes, and put your children"
22129,22130,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.159,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"To that destruction which I'll guard them from,"
22130,22131,Antony and Cleopatra,50.0,5.2.160,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
22131,22132,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,5.2.161,CLEOPATRA,"And may, through all the world: 'tis yours, and we,"
22132,22133,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,5.2.162,CLEOPATRA,"Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall"
22133,22134,Antony and Cleopatra,51.0,5.2.163,CLEOPATRA,"Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord."
22134,22135,Antony and Cleopatra,52.0,5.2.164,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
22135,22136,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,5.2.165,CLEOPATRA,"This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,"
22136,22137,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,5.2.166,CLEOPATRA,"I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued,"
22137,22138,Antony and Cleopatra,53.0,5.2.167,CLEOPATRA,Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
22138,22139,Antony and Cleopatra,54.0,5.2.168,SELEUCUS,"Here, madam."
22139,22140,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,5.2.169,CLEOPATRA,"This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,"
22140,22141,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,5.2.170,CLEOPATRA,"Upon his peril, that I have reserved"
22141,22142,Antony and Cleopatra,55.0,5.2.171,CLEOPATRA,"To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus."
22142,22143,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,5.2.172,SELEUCUS,"Madam,"
22143,22144,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,5.2.173,SELEUCUS,"I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,"
22144,22145,Antony and Cleopatra,56.0,5.2.174,SELEUCUS,Speak that which is not.
22145,22146,Antony and Cleopatra,57.0,5.2.175,CLEOPATRA,What have I kept back?
22146,22147,Antony and Cleopatra,58.0,5.2.176,SELEUCUS,Enough to purchase what you have made known.
22147,22148,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,5.2.177,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Nay, blush not, Cleopatra, I approve"
22148,22149,Antony and Cleopatra,59.0,5.2.178,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Your wisdom in the deed.
22149,22150,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.179,CLEOPATRA,"See, Caesar! O, behold,"
22150,22151,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.180,CLEOPATRA,"How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours,"
22151,22152,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.181,CLEOPATRA,"And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine."
22152,22153,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.182,CLEOPATRA,The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
22153,22154,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.183,CLEOPATRA,"Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust"
22154,22155,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.184,CLEOPATRA,"Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt"
22155,22156,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.185,CLEOPATRA,"Go back, I warrant thee, but I'll catch thine eyes,"
22156,22157,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.186,CLEOPATRA,"Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!"
22157,22158,Antony and Cleopatra,60.0,5.2.187,CLEOPATRA,O rarely base!
22158,22159,Antony and Cleopatra,61.0,5.2.188,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Good queen, let us entreat you."
22159,22160,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.189,CLEOPATRA,"O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,"
22160,22161,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.190,CLEOPATRA,"That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,"
22161,22162,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.191,CLEOPATRA,Doing the honour of thy lordliness
22162,22163,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.192,CLEOPATRA,"To one so meek, that mine own servant should"
22163,22164,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.193,CLEOPATRA,Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
22164,22165,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.194,CLEOPATRA,"Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,"
22165,22166,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.195,CLEOPATRA,"That I some lady trifles have reserved,"
22166,22167,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.196,CLEOPATRA,"Immoment toys, things of such dignity"
22167,22168,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.197,CLEOPATRA,"As we greet modern friends withal, and say,"
22168,22169,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.198,CLEOPATRA,Some nobler token I have kept apart
22169,22170,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.199,CLEOPATRA,"For Livia and Octavia, to induce"
22170,22171,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.200,CLEOPATRA,"Their mediation, must I be unfolded"
22171,22172,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.201,CLEOPATRA,With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
22172,22173,Antony and Cleopatra,62.0,5.2.202,CLEOPATRA,Beneath the fall I have.

22352,22353,Antony and Cleopatra,110.0,5.2.364,CLEOPATRA,"As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--"
22353,22354,Antony and Cleopatra,110.0,5.2.365,CLEOPATRA,"O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too."
22354,22355,Antony and Cleopatra,110.0,,CLEOPATRA,Applying another asp to her arm
22355,22356,Antony and Cleopatra,110.0,5.2.366,CLEOPATRA,What should I stay--
22356,22357,Antony and Cleopatra,110.0,,CLEOPATRA,Dies
22357,22358,Antony and Cleopatra,111.0,5.2.367,CHARMIAN,"In this vile world? So, fare thee well."
22358,22359,Antony and Cleopatra,111.0,5.2.368,CHARMIAN,"Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies"
22359,22360,Antony and Cleopatra,111.0,5.2.369,CHARMIAN,"A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close,"
22360,22361,Antony and Cleopatra,111.0,5.2.370,CHARMIAN,And golden Phoebus never be beheld
22361,22362,Antony and Cleopatra,111.0,5.2.371,CHARMIAN,"Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry,"
22362,22363,Antony and Cleopatra,111.0,5.2.372,CHARMIAN,"I'll mend it, and then play."
22363,22364,Antony and Cleopatra,111.0,,CHARMIAN,"Enter the Guard, rushing in"
22364,22365,Antony and Cleopatra,112.0,5.2.373,First Guard,Where is the queen?
22365,22366,Antony and Cleopatra,113.0,5.2.374,CHARMIAN,"Speak softly, wake her not."
22366,22367,Antony and Cleopatra,114.0,5.2.375,First Guard,Caesar hath sent--
22367,22368,Antony and Cleopatra,115.0,5.2.376,CHARMIAN,Too slow a messenger.
22368,22369,Antony and Cleopatra,115.0,,CHARMIAN,Applies an asp
22369,22370,Antony and Cleopatra,115.0,5.2.377,CHARMIAN,"O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee."
22370,22371,Antony and Cleopatra,116.0,5.2.378,First Guard,"Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled."
22371,22372,Antony and Cleopatra,117.0,5.2.379,Second Guard,"There's Dolabella sent from Caesar, call him."
22372,22373,Antony and Cleopatra,118.0,5.2.380,First Guard,"What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?"
22373,22374,Antony and Cleopatra,119.0,5.2.381,CHARMIAN,"It is well done, and fitting for a princess"
22374,22375,Antony and Cleopatra,119.0,5.2.382,CHARMIAN,Descended of so many royal kings.
22375,22376,Antony and Cleopatra,119.0,5.2.383,CHARMIAN,"Ah, soldier!"
22376,22377,Antony and Cleopatra,119.0,,CHARMIAN,Dies
22377,22378,Antony and Cleopatra,119.0,,CHARMIAN,Re-enter DOLABELLA
22378,22379,Antony and Cleopatra,120.0,5.2.384,DOLABELLA,How goes it here?
22379,22380,Antony and Cleopatra,121.0,5.2.385,Second Guard,All dead.
22380,22381,Antony and Cleopatra,122.0,5.2.386,DOLABELLA,"Caesar, thy thoughts"
22381,22382,Antony and Cleopatra,122.0,5.2.387,DOLABELLA,Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
22382,22383,Antony and Cleopatra,122.0,5.2.388,DOLABELLA,To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
22383,22384,Antony and Cleopatra,122.0,5.2.389,DOLABELLA,So sought'st to hinder.
22384,22385,Antony and Cleopatra,122.0,5.2.389,DOLABELLA,"Within  'A way there, a way for Caesar!'"
22385,22386,Antony and Cleopatra,122.0,,DOLABELLA,Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching
22386,22387,Antony and Cleopatra,123.0,5.2.390,DOLABELLA,"O sir, you are too sure an augurer,"
22387,22388,Antony and Cleopatra,123.0,5.2.391,DOLABELLA,That you did fear is done.
22388,22389,Antony and Cleopatra,124.0,5.2.392,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Bravest at the last,"
22389,22390,Antony and Cleopatra,124.0,5.2.393,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,"
22390,22391,Antony and Cleopatra,124.0,5.2.394,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
22391,22392,Antony and Cleopatra,124.0,5.2.395,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,I do not see them bleed.
22392,22393,Antony and Cleopatra,125.0,5.2.396,DOLABELLA,Who was last with them?
22393,22394,Antony and Cleopatra,126.0,5.2.397,First Guard,"A simple countryman, that brought her figs:"
22394,22395,Antony and Cleopatra,126.0,5.2.398,First Guard,This was his basket.
22395,22396,Antony and Cleopatra,127.0,5.2.399,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Poison'd, then."
22396,22397,Antony and Cleopatra,128.0,5.2.400,First Guard,"O Caesar,"
22397,22398,Antony and Cleopatra,128.0,5.2.401,First Guard,"This Charmian lived but now, she stood and spake:"
22398,22399,Antony and Cleopatra,128.0,5.2.402,First Guard,I found her trimming up the diadem
22399,22400,Antony and Cleopatra,128.0,5.2.403,First Guard,"On her dead mistress, tremblingly she stood"
22400,22401,Antony and Cleopatra,128.0,5.2.404,First Guard,And on the sudden dropp'd.
22401,22402,Antony and Cleopatra,129.0,5.2.405,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,O noble weakness!
22402,22403,Antony and Cleopatra,129.0,5.2.406,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear"
22403,22404,Antony and Cleopatra,129.0,5.2.407,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,"
22404,22405,Antony and Cleopatra,129.0,5.2.408,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,As she would catch another Antony
22405,22406,Antony and Cleopatra,129.0,5.2.409,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,In her strong toil of grace.
22406,22407,Antony and Cleopatra,130.0,5.2.410,DOLABELLA,"Here, on her breast,"
22407,22408,Antony and Cleopatra,130.0,5.2.411,DOLABELLA,There is a vent of blood and something blown:
22408,22409,Antony and Cleopatra,130.0,5.2.412,DOLABELLA,The like is on her arm.
22409,22410,Antony and Cleopatra,131.0,5.2.413,First Guard,This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
22410,22411,Antony and Cleopatra,131.0,5.2.414,First Guard,"Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves"
22411,22412,Antony and Cleopatra,131.0,5.2.415,First Guard,Upon the caves of Nile.
22412,22413,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.416,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Most probable
22413,22414,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.417,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"That so she died, for her physician tells me"
22414,22415,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.418,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,She hath pursued conclusions infinite
22415,22416,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.419,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,"
22416,22417,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.420,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,And bear her women from the monument:
22417,22418,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.421,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,She shall be buried by her Antony:
22418,22419,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.422,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
22419,22420,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.423,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,A pair so famous. High events as these
22420,22421,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.424,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"Strike those that make them, and their story is"
22421,22422,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.425,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,No less in pity than his glory which
22422,22423,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.426,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
22423,22424,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.427,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"In solemn show attend this funeral,"
22424,22425,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.428,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,"And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see"
22425,22426,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,5.2.429,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,High order in this great solemnity.
22426,22427,Antony and Cleopatra,132.0,,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,Exeunt

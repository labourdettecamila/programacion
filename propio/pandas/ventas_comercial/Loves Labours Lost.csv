52793,52794,Loves Labours Lost,124.0,,ALBANY,ACT I
52794,52795,Loves Labours Lost,124.0,,ALBANY,SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.
52795,52796,Loves Labours Lost,124.0,,ALBANY,"Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN"
52796,52797,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.1,FERDINAND,"Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,"
52797,52798,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.2,FERDINAND,Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
52798,52799,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.3,FERDINAND,"And then grace us in the disgrace of death,"
52799,52800,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.4,FERDINAND,"When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,"
52800,52801,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.5,FERDINAND,The endeavor of this present breath may buy
52801,52802,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.6,FERDINAND,That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
52802,52803,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.7,FERDINAND,And make us heirs of all eternity.
52803,52804,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.8,FERDINAND,"Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,"
52804,52805,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.9,FERDINAND,That war against your own affections
52805,52806,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.10,FERDINAND,"And the huge army of the world's desires,--"
52806,52807,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.11,FERDINAND,Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
52807,52808,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.12,FERDINAND,"Navarre shall be the wonder of the world,"
52808,52809,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.13,FERDINAND,"Our court shall be a little Academe,"
52809,52810,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.14,FERDINAND,Still and contemplative in living art.
52810,52811,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.15,FERDINAND,"You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,"
52811,52812,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.16,FERDINAND,Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
52812,52813,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.17,FERDINAND,"My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes"
52813,52814,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.18,FERDINAND,That are recorded in this schedule here:
52814,52815,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.19,FERDINAND,"Your oaths are pass'd, and now subscribe your names,"
52815,52816,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.20,FERDINAND,That his own hand may strike his honour down
52816,52817,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.21,FERDINAND,That violates the smallest branch herein:
52817,52818,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.22,FERDINAND,"If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,"
52818,52819,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,1.1.23,FERDINAND,"Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too."
52819,52820,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,1.1.24,LONGAVILLE,"I am resolved, 'tis but a three years' fast:"
52820,52821,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,1.1.25,LONGAVILLE,"The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:"
52821,52822,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,1.1.26,LONGAVILLE,"Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits"
52822,52823,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,1.1.27,LONGAVILLE,"Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits."
52823,52824,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,1.1.28,DUMAIN,"My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:"
52824,52825,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,1.1.29,DUMAIN,The grosser manner of these world's delights
52825,52826,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,1.1.30,DUMAIN,He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
52826,52827,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,1.1.31,DUMAIN,"To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,"
52827,52828,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,1.1.32,DUMAIN,With all these living in philosophy.
52828,52829,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.33,BIRON,"I can but say their protestation over,"
52829,52830,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.34,BIRON,"So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,"
52830,52831,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.35,BIRON,"That is, to live and study here three years."
52831,52832,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.36,BIRON,"But there are other strict observances,"
52832,52833,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.37,BIRON,"As, not to see a woman in that term,"
52833,52834,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.38,BIRON,"Which I hope well is not enrolled there,"
52834,52835,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.39,BIRON,And one day in a week to touch no food
52835,52836,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.40,BIRON,"And but one meal on every day beside,"
52836,52837,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.41,BIRON,"The which I hope is not enrolled there,"
52837,52838,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.42,BIRON,"And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,"
52838,52839,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.43,BIRON,And not be seen to wink of all the day--
52839,52840,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.44,BIRON,When I was wont to think no harm all night
52840,52841,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.45,BIRON,And make a dark night too of half the day--
52841,52842,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.46,BIRON,Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
52842,52843,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.47,BIRON,"O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,"
52843,52844,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,1.1.48,BIRON,"Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!"
52844,52845,Loves Labours Lost,5.0,1.1.49,FERDINAND,Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
52845,52846,Loves Labours Lost,6.0,1.1.50,BIRON,"Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:"
52846,52847,Loves Labours Lost,6.0,1.1.51,BIRON,I only swore to study with your grace
52847,52848,Loves Labours Lost,6.0,1.1.52,BIRON,And stay here in your court for three years' space.
52848,52849,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,1.1.53,LONGAVILLE,"You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest."
52849,52850,Loves Labours Lost,8.0,1.1.54,BIRON,"By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest."
52850,52851,Loves Labours Lost,8.0,1.1.55,BIRON,What is the end of study? let me know.
52851,52852,Loves Labours Lost,9.0,1.1.56,FERDINAND,"Why, that to know, which else we should not know."
52852,52853,Loves Labours Lost,10.0,1.1.57,BIRON,"Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?"
52853,52854,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,1.1.58,FERDINAND,"Ay, that is study's godlike recompense."
52854,52855,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.59,BIRON,"Come on, then, I will swear to study so,"
52855,52856,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.60,BIRON,To know the thing I am forbid to know:
52856,52857,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.61,BIRON,"As thus,--to study where I well may dine,"
52857,52858,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.62,BIRON,"When I to feast expressly am forbid,"
52858,52859,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.63,BIRON,"Or study where to meet some mistress fine,"
52859,52860,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.64,BIRON,"When mistresses from common sense are hid,"
52860,52861,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.65,BIRON,"Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,"
52861,52862,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.66,BIRON,Study to break it and not break my troth.
52862,52863,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.67,BIRON,"If study's gain be thus and this be so,"
52863,52864,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.68,BIRON,Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
52864,52865,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,1.1.69,BIRON,"Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no."
52865,52866,Loves Labours Lost,13.0,1.1.70,FERDINAND,These be the stops that hinder study quite
52866,52867,Loves Labours Lost,13.0,1.1.71,FERDINAND,And train our intellects to vain delight.
52867,52868,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.72,BIRON,"Why, all delights are vain, but that most vain,"
52868,52869,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.73,BIRON,Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
52869,52870,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.74,BIRON,"As, painfully to pore upon a book"
52870,52871,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.75,BIRON,"To seek the light of truth, while truth the while"
52871,52872,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.76,BIRON,Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
52872,52873,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.77,BIRON,Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
52873,52874,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.78,BIRON,"So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,"
52874,52875,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.79,BIRON,Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
52875,52876,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.80,BIRON,Study me how to please the eye indeed
52876,52877,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.81,BIRON,"By fixing it upon a fairer eye,"
52877,52878,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.82,BIRON,"Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed"
52878,52879,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.83,BIRON,And give him light that it was blinded by.
52879,52880,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.84,BIRON,Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
52880,52881,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.85,BIRON,That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
52881,52882,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.86,BIRON,Small have continual plodders ever won
52882,52883,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.87,BIRON,Save base authority from others' books
52883,52884,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.88,BIRON,These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
52884,52885,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.89,BIRON,That give a name to every fixed star
52885,52886,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.90,BIRON,Have no more profit of their shining nights
52886,52887,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.91,BIRON,Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
52887,52888,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.92,BIRON,"Too much to know is to know nought but fame,"
52888,52889,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,1.1.93,BIRON,And every godfather can give a name.
52889,52890,Loves Labours Lost,15.0,1.1.94,FERDINAND,"How well he's read, to reason against reading!"
52890,52891,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,1.1.95,DUMAIN,"Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!"
52891,52892,Loves Labours Lost,17.0,1.1.96,LONGAVILLE,He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
52892,52893,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,1.1.97,BIRON,The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
52893,52894,Loves Labours Lost,19.0,1.1.98,DUMAIN,How follows that?
52894,52895,Loves Labours Lost,20.0,1.1.99,BIRON,Fit in his place and time.
52895,52896,Loves Labours Lost,21.0,1.1.100,DUMAIN,In reason nothing.
52896,52897,Loves Labours Lost,22.0,1.1.101,BIRON,Something then in rhyme.
52897,52898,Loves Labours Lost,23.0,1.1.102,FERDINAND,"Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,"
52898,52899,Loves Labours Lost,23.0,1.1.103,FERDINAND,That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
52899,52900,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.104,BIRON,"Well, say I am, why should proud summer boast"
52900,52901,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.105,BIRON,Before the birds have any cause to sing?
52901,52902,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.106,BIRON,Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
52902,52903,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.107,BIRON,At Christmas I no more desire a rose
52903,52904,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.108,BIRON,"Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth,"
52904,52905,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.109,BIRON,But like of each thing that in season grows.
52905,52906,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.110,BIRON,"So you, to study now it is too late,"
52906,52907,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,1.1.111,BIRON,Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
52907,52908,Loves Labours Lost,25.0,1.1.112,FERDINAND,"Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu."
52908,52909,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,1.1.113,BIRON,"No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you:"
52909,52910,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,1.1.114,BIRON,And though I have for barbarism spoke more
52910,52911,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,1.1.115,BIRON,"Than for that angel knowledge you can say,"
52911,52912,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,1.1.116,BIRON,Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
52912,52913,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,1.1.117,BIRON,And bide the penance of each three years' day.
52913,52914,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,1.1.118,BIRON,"Give me the paper, let me read the same,"
52914,52915,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,1.1.119,BIRON,And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
52915,52916,Loves Labours Lost,27.0,1.1.120,FERDINAND,How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
52916,52917,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,1.1.121,BIRON,"[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a"
52917,52918,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,1.1.122,BIRON,mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
52918,52919,Loves Labours Lost,29.0,1.1.123,LONGAVILLE,Four days ago.
52919,52920,Loves Labours Lost,30.0,1.1.124,BIRON,Let's see the penalty.
52920,52921,Loves Labours Lost,30.0,,BIRON,Reads
52921,52922,Loves Labours Lost,30.0,1.1.125,BIRON,'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
52922,52923,Loves Labours Lost,31.0,1.1.126,LONGAVILLE,"Marry, that did I."
52923,52924,Loves Labours Lost,32.0,1.1.127,BIRON,"Sweet lord, and why?"
52924,52925,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,1.1.128,LONGAVILLE,To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
52925,52926,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.129,BIRON,A dangerous law against gentility!
52926,52927,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,,BIRON,Reads
52927,52928,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.130,BIRON,"'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman"
52928,52929,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.131,BIRON,"within the term of three years, he shall endure such"
52929,52930,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.132,BIRON,public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
52930,52931,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.133,BIRON,"This article, my liege, yourself must break,"
52931,52932,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.134,BIRON,For well you know here comes in embassy
52932,52933,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.135,BIRON,The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
52933,52934,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.136,BIRON,A maid of grace and complete majesty--
52934,52935,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.137,BIRON,About surrender up of Aquitaine
52935,52936,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.138,BIRON,"To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:"
52936,52937,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.139,BIRON,"Therefore this article is made in vain,"
52937,52938,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,1.1.140,BIRON,Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
52938,52939,Loves Labours Lost,35.0,1.1.141,FERDINAND,"What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot."
52939,52940,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,1.1.142,BIRON,So study evermore is overshot:
52940,52941,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,1.1.143,BIRON,While it doth study to have what it would
52941,52942,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,1.1.144,BIRON,"It doth forget to do the thing it should,"
52942,52943,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,1.1.145,BIRON,"And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,"
52943,52944,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,1.1.146,BIRON,"'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost."
52944,52945,Loves Labours Lost,37.0,1.1.147,FERDINAND,"We must of force dispense with this decree,"
52945,52946,Loves Labours Lost,37.0,1.1.148,FERDINAND,She must lie here on mere necessity.
52946,52947,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.149,BIRON,Necessity will make us all forsworn
52947,52948,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.150,BIRON,"Three thousand times within this three years' space,"
52948,52949,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.151,BIRON,"For every man with his affects is born,"
52949,52950,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.152,BIRON,Not by might master'd but by special grace:

52951,52952,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.154,BIRON,I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
52952,52953,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.155,BIRON,So to the laws at large I write my name:
52953,52954,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,,BIRON,Subscribes
52954,52955,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.156,BIRON,And he that breaks them in the least degree
52955,52956,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.157,BIRON,Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
52956,52957,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.158,BIRON,"Suggestions are to other as to me,"
52957,52958,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.159,BIRON,"But I believe, although I seem so loath,"
52958,52959,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.160,BIRON,I am the last that will last keep his oath.
52959,52960,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,1.1.161,BIRON,But is there no quick recreation granted?
52960,52961,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.162,FERDINAND,"Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted"
52961,52962,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.163,FERDINAND,"With a refined traveller of Spain,"
52962,52963,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.164,FERDINAND,"A man in all the world's new fashion planted,"
52963,52964,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.165,FERDINAND,"That hath a mint of phrases in his brain,"
52964,52965,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.166,FERDINAND,One whom the music of his own vain tongue
52965,52966,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.167,FERDINAND,"Doth ravish like enchanting harmony,"
52966,52967,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.168,FERDINAND,"A man of complements, whom right and wrong"
52967,52968,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,1.1.169,FERDINAND,Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:

53324,53325,Loves Labours Lost,92.0,,ADRIANO DE ARMADO,"Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants"
53325,53326,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.1,BOYET,"Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:"
53326,53327,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.2,BOYET,"Consider who the king your father sends,"
53327,53328,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.3,BOYET,"To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:"
53328,53329,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.4,BOYET,"Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,"
53329,53330,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.5,BOYET,To parley with the sole inheritor
53330,53331,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.6,BOYET,"Of all perfections that a man may owe,"
53331,53332,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.7,BOYET,"Matchless Navarre, the plea of no less weight"
53332,53333,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.8,BOYET,"Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen."
53333,53334,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.9,BOYET,Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
53334,53335,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.10,BOYET,As Nature was in making graces dear
53335,53336,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.11,BOYET,When she did starve the general world beside
53336,53337,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,2.1.12,BOYET,And prodigally gave them all to you.
53337,53338,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.13,PRINCESS,"Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,"
53338,53339,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.14,PRINCESS,Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
53339,53340,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.15,PRINCESS,"Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,"
53340,53341,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.16,PRINCESS,Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
53341,53342,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.17,PRINCESS,I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
53342,53343,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.18,PRINCESS,Than you much willing to be counted wise
53343,53344,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.19,PRINCESS,In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
53344,53345,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.20,PRINCESS,"But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,"
53345,53346,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.21,PRINCESS,"You are not ignorant, all-telling fame"
53346,53347,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.22,PRINCESS,"Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,"
53347,53348,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.23,PRINCESS,"Till painful study shall outwear three years,"
53348,53349,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.24,PRINCESS,No woman may approach his silent court:
53349,53350,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.25,PRINCESS,"Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,"
53350,53351,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.26,PRINCESS,"Before we enter his forbidden gates,"
53351,53352,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.27,PRINCESS,"To know his pleasure, and in that behalf,"
53352,53353,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.28,PRINCESS,"Bold of your worthiness, we single you"
53353,53354,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.29,PRINCESS,As our best-moving fair solicitor.
53354,53355,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.30,PRINCESS,"Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,"
53355,53356,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.31,PRINCESS,"On serious business, craving quick dispatch,"
53356,53357,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.32,PRINCESS,Importunes personal conference with his grace:
53357,53358,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.33,PRINCESS,"Haste, signify so much, while we attend,"
53358,53359,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,2.1.34,PRINCESS,"Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will."
53359,53360,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,2.1.35,BOYET,"Proud of employment, willingly I go."
53360,53361,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,2.1.36,PRINCESS,"All pride is willing pride, and yours is so."
53361,53362,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,,PRINCESS,Exit BOYET
53362,53363,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,2.1.37,PRINCESS,"Who are the votaries, my loving lords,"
53363,53364,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,2.1.38,PRINCESS,That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
53364,53365,Loves Labours Lost,5.0,2.1.39,First Lord,Lord Longaville is one.
53365,53366,Loves Labours Lost,6.0,2.1.40,PRINCESS,Know you the man?
53366,53367,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.41,MARIA,"I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,"
53367,53368,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.42,MARIA,Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
53368,53369,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.43,MARIA,"Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized"
53369,53370,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.44,MARIA,"In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:"
53370,53371,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.45,MARIA,"A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd,"
53371,53372,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.46,MARIA,"Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:"
53372,53373,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.47,MARIA,Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
53373,53374,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.48,MARIA,"The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,"
53374,53375,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.49,MARIA,"If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,"
53375,53376,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.50,MARIA,"Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will,"
53376,53377,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.51,MARIA,"Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills"
53377,53378,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,2.1.52,MARIA,It should none spare that come within his power.
53378,53379,Loves Labours Lost,8.0,2.1.53,PRINCESS,"Some merry mocking lord, belike, is't so?"
53379,53380,Loves Labours Lost,9.0,2.1.54,MARIA,They say so most that most his humours know.
53380,53381,Loves Labours Lost,10.0,2.1.55,PRINCESS,Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
53381,53382,Loves Labours Lost,10.0,2.1.56,PRINCESS,Who are the rest?
53382,53383,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.57,KATHARINE,"The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,"
53383,53384,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.58,KATHARINE,Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
53384,53385,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.59,KATHARINE,"Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill,"
53385,53386,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.60,KATHARINE,"For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,"
53386,53387,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.61,KATHARINE,And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
53387,53388,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.62,KATHARINE,"I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once,"
53388,53389,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.63,KATHARINE,And much too little of that good I saw
53389,53390,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,2.1.64,KATHARINE,Is my report to his great worthiness.
53390,53391,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.65,ROSALINE,Another of these students at that time
53391,53392,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.66,ROSALINE,"Was there with him, if I have heard a truth."
53392,53393,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.67,ROSALINE,"Biron they call him, but a merrier man,"
53393,53394,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.68,ROSALINE,"Within the limit of becoming mirth,"
53394,53395,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.69,ROSALINE,I never spent an hour's talk withal:
53395,53396,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.70,ROSALINE,"His eye begets occasion for his wit,"
53396,53397,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.71,ROSALINE,For every object that the one doth catch
53397,53398,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.72,ROSALINE,"The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,"
53398,53399,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.73,ROSALINE,"Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,"
53399,53400,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.74,ROSALINE,Delivers in such apt and gracious words
53400,53401,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.75,ROSALINE,That aged ears play truant at his tales
53401,53402,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.76,ROSALINE,"And younger hearings are quite ravished,"
53402,53403,Loves Labours Lost,12.0,2.1.77,ROSALINE,So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
53403,53404,Loves Labours Lost,13.0,2.1.78,PRINCESS,"God bless my ladies! are they all in love,"
53404,53405,Loves Labours Lost,13.0,2.1.79,PRINCESS,That every one her own hath garnished
53405,53406,Loves Labours Lost,13.0,2.1.80,PRINCESS,With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
53406,53407,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,2.1.81,First Lord,Here comes Boyet.
53407,53408,Loves Labours Lost,14.0,,First Lord,Re-enter BOYET
53408,53409,Loves Labours Lost,15.0,2.1.82,PRINCESS,"Now, what admittance, lord?"
53409,53410,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.83,BOYET,"Navarre had notice of your fair approach,"
53410,53411,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.84,BOYET,And he and his competitors in oath
53411,53412,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.85,BOYET,"Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,"
53412,53413,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.86,BOYET,"Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:"
53413,53414,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.87,BOYET,"He rather means to lodge you in the field,"
53414,53415,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.88,BOYET,"Like one that comes here to besiege his court,"
53415,53416,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.89,BOYET,"Than seek a dispensation for his oath,"
53416,53417,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.90,BOYET,To let you enter his unpeopled house.
53417,53418,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,2.1.91,BOYET,Here comes Navarre.
53418,53419,Loves Labours Lost,16.0,,BOYET,"Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants"
53419,53420,Loves Labours Lost,17.0,2.1.92,FERDINAND,"Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre."
53420,53421,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,2.1.93,PRINCESS,"'Fair' I give you back again, and 'welcome' I have"
53421,53422,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,2.1.94,PRINCESS,not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
53422,53423,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,2.1.95,PRINCESS,"yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine."
53423,53424,Loves Labours Lost,19.0,2.1.96,FERDINAND,"You shall be welcome, madam, to my court."
53424,53425,Loves Labours Lost,20.0,2.1.97,PRINCESS,"I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither."
53425,53426,Loves Labours Lost,21.0,2.1.98,FERDINAND,"Hear me, dear lady, I have sworn an oath."
53426,53427,Loves Labours Lost,22.0,2.1.99,PRINCESS,Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
53427,53428,Loves Labours Lost,23.0,2.1.100,FERDINAND,"Not for the world, fair madam, by my will."
53428,53429,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,2.1.101,PRINCESS,"Why, will shall break it, will and nothing else."
53429,53430,Loves Labours Lost,25.0,2.1.102,FERDINAND,Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
53430,53431,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.103,PRINCESS,"Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,"
53431,53432,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.104,PRINCESS,Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
53432,53433,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.105,PRINCESS,I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
53433,53434,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.106,PRINCESS,"Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,"
53434,53435,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.107,PRINCESS,And sin to break it.
53435,53436,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.108,PRINCESS,But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
53436,53437,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.109,PRINCESS,To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
53437,53438,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.110,PRINCESS,"Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,"
53438,53439,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,2.1.111,PRINCESS,And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
53439,53440,Loves Labours Lost,27.0,2.1.112,FERDINAND,"Madam, I will, if suddenly I may."
53440,53441,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,2.1.113,PRINCESS,"You will the sooner, that I were away,"
53441,53442,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,2.1.114,PRINCESS,For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
53442,53443,Loves Labours Lost,29.0,2.1.115,BIRON,Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
53443,53444,Loves Labours Lost,30.0,2.1.116,ROSALINE,Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
53444,53445,Loves Labours Lost,31.0,2.1.117,BIRON,I know you did.
53445,53446,Loves Labours Lost,32.0,2.1.118,ROSALINE,How needless was it then to ask the question!
53446,53447,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,2.1.119,BIRON,You must not be so quick.
53447,53448,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,2.1.120,ROSALINE,'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
53448,53449,Loves Labours Lost,35.0,2.1.121,BIRON,"Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire."
53449,53450,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,2.1.122,ROSALINE,Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
53450,53451,Loves Labours Lost,37.0,2.1.123,BIRON,What time o' day?
53451,53452,Loves Labours Lost,38.0,2.1.124,ROSALINE,The hour that fools should ask.
53452,53453,Loves Labours Lost,39.0,2.1.125,BIRON,Now fair befall your mask!
53453,53454,Loves Labours Lost,40.0,2.1.126,ROSALINE,Fair fall the face it covers!
53454,53455,Loves Labours Lost,41.0,2.1.127,BIRON,And send you many lovers!
53455,53456,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,2.1.128,ROSALINE,"Amen, so you be none."
53456,53457,Loves Labours Lost,43.0,2.1.129,BIRON,"Nay, then will I be gone."
53457,53458,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.130,FERDINAND,"Madam, your father here doth intimate"
53458,53459,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.131,FERDINAND,"The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,"
53459,53460,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.132,FERDINAND,Being but the one half of an entire sum
53460,53461,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.133,FERDINAND,Disbursed by my father in his wars.
53461,53462,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.134,FERDINAND,"But say that he or we, as neither have,"
53462,53463,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.135,FERDINAND,"Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid"
53463,53464,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.136,FERDINAND,"A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,"
53464,53465,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.137,FERDINAND,"One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,"
53465,53466,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.138,FERDINAND,Although not valued to the money's worth.
53466,53467,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.139,FERDINAND,If then the king your father will restore
53467,53468,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.140,FERDINAND,"But that one half which is unsatisfied,"
53468,53469,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.141,FERDINAND,"We will give up our right in Aquitaine,"
53469,53470,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.142,FERDINAND,And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
53470,53471,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.143,FERDINAND,"But that, it seems, he little purposeth,"
53471,53472,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.144,FERDINAND,For here he doth demand to have repaid
53472,53473,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.145,FERDINAND,"A hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,"
53473,53474,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.146,FERDINAND,"On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,"
53474,53475,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.147,FERDINAND,"To have his title live in Aquitaine,"
53475,53476,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.148,FERDINAND,Which we much rather had depart withal
53476,53477,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.149,FERDINAND,And have the money by our father lent
53477,53478,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.150,FERDINAND,Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
53478,53479,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.151,FERDINAND,"Dear Princess, were not his requests so far"
53479,53480,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.152,FERDINAND,"From reason's yielding, your fair self should make"
53480,53481,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.153,FERDINAND,A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
53481,53482,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,2.1.154,FERDINAND,And go well satisfied to France again.
53482,53483,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,2.1.155,PRINCESS,You do the king my father too much wrong
53483,53484,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,2.1.156,PRINCESS,"And wrong the reputation of your name,"
53484,53485,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,2.1.157,PRINCESS,In so unseeming to confess receipt
53485,53486,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,2.1.158,PRINCESS,Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
53486,53487,Loves Labours Lost,46.0,2.1.159,FERDINAND,"I do protest I never heard of it,"
53487,53488,Loves Labours Lost,46.0,2.1.160,FERDINAND,"And if you prove it, I'll repay it back"
53488,53489,Loves Labours Lost,46.0,2.1.161,FERDINAND,Or yield up Aquitaine.
53489,53490,Loves Labours Lost,47.0,2.1.162,PRINCESS,We arrest your word.
53490,53491,Loves Labours Lost,47.0,2.1.163,PRINCESS,"Boyet, you can produce acquittances"
53491,53492,Loves Labours Lost,47.0,2.1.164,PRINCESS,For such a sum from special officers
53492,53493,Loves Labours Lost,47.0,2.1.165,PRINCESS,Of Charles his father.
53493,53494,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,2.1.166,FERDINAND,Satisfy me so.
53494,53495,Loves Labours Lost,49.0,2.1.167,BOYET,"So please your grace, the packet is not come"
53495,53496,Loves Labours Lost,49.0,2.1.168,BOYET,Where that and other specialties are bound:
53496,53497,Loves Labours Lost,49.0,2.1.169,BOYET,To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

54555,54556,Loves Labours Lost,93.0,4.3.345,BIRON,When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
54556,54557,Loves Labours Lost,93.0,4.3.346,BIRON,Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
54557,54558,Loves Labours Lost,93.0,4.3.347,BIRON,"Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails,"
54558,54559,Loves Labours Lost,93.0,4.3.348,BIRON,Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:

54569,54570,Loves Labours Lost,93.0,4.3.359,BIRON,From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:

54775,54776,Loves Labours Lost,1.0,5.2.4,PRINCESS,Look you what I have from the loving king.
54776,54777,Loves Labours Lost,2.0,5.2.5,ROSALINE,"Madame, came nothing else along with that?"
54777,54778,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,5.2.6,PRINCESS,"Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme"
54778,54779,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,5.2.7,PRINCESS,"As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,"

54780,54781,Loves Labours Lost,3.0,5.2.9,PRINCESS,That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

54782,54783,Loves Labours Lost,4.0,5.2.11,ROSALINE,For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
54783,54784,Loves Labours Lost,5.0,5.2.12,KATHARINE,"Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too."
54784,54785,Loves Labours Lost,6.0,5.2.13,ROSALINE,"You'll ne'er be friends with him, a' kill'd your sister."
54785,54786,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,5.2.14,KATHARINE,"He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy,"
54786,54787,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,5.2.15,KATHARINE,"And so she died: had she been light, like you,"
54787,54788,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,5.2.16,KATHARINE,"Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,"
54788,54789,Loves Labours Lost,7.0,5.2.17,KATHARINE,She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:

54790,54791,Loves Labours Lost,8.0,5.2.19,ROSALINE,"What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?"
54791,54792,Loves Labours Lost,9.0,5.2.20,KATHARINE,A light condition in a beauty dark.
54792,54793,Loves Labours Lost,10.0,5.2.21,ROSALINE,We need more light to find your meaning out.
54793,54794,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,5.2.22,KATHARINE,"You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff,"
54794,54795,Loves Labours Lost,11.0,5.2.23,KATHARINE,Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.

54796,54797,Loves Labours Lost,13.0,5.2.25,KATHARINE,"So do not you, for you are a light wench."

54803,54804,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.32,ROSALINE,I would you knew:
54804,54805,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.33,ROSALINE,"An if my face were but as fair as yours,"
54805,54806,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.34,ROSALINE,"My favour were as great, be witness this."
54806,54807,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.35,ROSALINE,"Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:"
54807,54808,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.36,ROSALINE,"The numbers true, and, were the numbering too,"
54808,54809,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.37,ROSALINE,I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
54809,54810,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.38,ROSALINE,I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
54810,54811,Loves Labours Lost,18.0,5.2.39,ROSALINE,"O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!"
54811,54812,Loves Labours Lost,19.0,5.2.40,PRINCESS,Any thing like?
54812,54813,Loves Labours Lost,20.0,5.2.41,ROSALINE,"Much in the letters, nothing in the praise."
54813,54814,Loves Labours Lost,21.0,5.2.42,PRINCESS,"Beauteous as ink, a good conclusion."
54814,54815,Loves Labours Lost,22.0,5.2.43,KATHARINE,Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
54815,54816,Loves Labours Lost,23.0,5.2.44,ROSALINE,"'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,"
54816,54817,Loves Labours Lost,23.0,5.2.45,ROSALINE,"My red dominical, my golden letter:"
54817,54818,Loves Labours Lost,23.0,5.2.46,ROSALINE,"O, that your face were not so full of O's!"
54818,54819,Loves Labours Lost,24.0,5.2.47,KATHARINE,A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
54819,54820,Loves Labours Lost,25.0,5.2.48,PRINCESS,"But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?"
54820,54821,Loves Labours Lost,26.0,5.2.49,KATHARINE,"Madam, this glove."
54821,54822,Loves Labours Lost,27.0,5.2.50,PRINCESS,Did he not send you twain?
54822,54823,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,5.2.51,KATHARINE,"Yes, madam, and moreover"
54823,54824,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,5.2.52,KATHARINE,"Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,"
54824,54825,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,5.2.53,KATHARINE,"A huge translation of hypocrisy,"
54825,54826,Loves Labours Lost,28.0,5.2.54,KATHARINE,"Vilely compiled, profound simplicity."
54826,54827,Loves Labours Lost,29.0,5.2.55,MARIA,This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
54827,54828,Loves Labours Lost,29.0,5.2.56,MARIA,The letter is too long by half a mile.
54828,54829,Loves Labours Lost,30.0,5.2.57,PRINCESS,I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
54829,54830,Loves Labours Lost,30.0,5.2.58,PRINCESS,The chain were longer and the letter short?
54830,54831,Loves Labours Lost,31.0,5.2.59,MARIA,"Ay, or I would these hands might never part."
54831,54832,Loves Labours Lost,32.0,5.2.60,PRINCESS,We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
54832,54833,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.61,ROSALINE,They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
54833,54834,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.62,ROSALINE,That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
54834,54835,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.63,ROSALINE,O that I knew he were but in by the week!
54835,54836,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.64,ROSALINE,How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
54836,54837,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.65,ROSALINE,And wait the season and observe the times
54837,54838,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.66,ROSALINE,And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
54838,54839,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.67,ROSALINE,And shape his service wholly to my hests
54839,54840,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.68,ROSALINE,And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
54840,54841,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.69,ROSALINE,So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
54841,54842,Loves Labours Lost,33.0,5.2.70,ROSALINE,That he should be my fool and I his fate.
54842,54843,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,5.2.71,PRINCESS,"None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,"
54843,54844,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,5.2.72,PRINCESS,"As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,"
54844,54845,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,5.2.73,PRINCESS,Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
54845,54846,Loves Labours Lost,34.0,5.2.74,PRINCESS,And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
54846,54847,Loves Labours Lost,35.0,5.2.75,ROSALINE,The blood of youth burns not with such excess
54847,54848,Loves Labours Lost,35.0,5.2.76,ROSALINE,As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
54848,54849,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,5.2.77,MARIA,Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
54849,54850,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,5.2.78,MARIA,"As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote,"
54850,54851,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,5.2.79,MARIA,Since all the power thereof it doth apply
54851,54852,Loves Labours Lost,36.0,5.2.80,MARIA,"To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity."
54852,54853,Loves Labours Lost,37.0,5.2.81,PRINCESS,"Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face."

54862,54863,Loves Labours Lost,41.0,5.2.90,PRINCESS,Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
54863,54864,Loves Labours Lost,41.0,5.2.91,PRINCESS,"That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say."
54864,54865,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.92,BOYET,Under the cool shade of a sycamore

54868,54869,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.96,BOYET,The king and his companions: warily

54870,54871,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.98,BOYET,"And overheard what you shall overhear,"

54875,54876,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.103,BOYET,"'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'"
54876,54877,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.104,BOYET,And ever and anon they made a doubt

54878,54879,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.106,BOYET,"'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see,"
54879,54880,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.107,BOYET,"Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'"
54880,54881,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.108,BOYET,"The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil,"
54881,54882,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.109,BOYET,I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
54882,54883,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.110,BOYET,"With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,"
54883,54884,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.111,BOYET,Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
54884,54885,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.112,BOYET,"One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore"
54885,54886,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.113,BOYET,"A better speech was never spoke before,"
54886,54887,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.114,BOYET,"Another, with his finger and his thumb,"
54887,54888,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.115,BOYET,"Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come,'"
54888,54889,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.116,BOYET,"The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well,'"
54889,54890,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.117,BOYET,"The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell."
54890,54891,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.118,BOYET,"With that, they all did tumble on the ground,"
54891,54892,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.119,BOYET,"With such a zealous laughter, so profound,"
54892,54893,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.120,BOYET,"That in this spleen ridiculous appears,"
54893,54894,Loves Labours Lost,42.0,5.2.121,BOYET,"To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears."
54894,54895,Loves Labours Lost,43.0,5.2.122,PRINCESS,"But what, but what, come they to visit us?"
54895,54896,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,5.2.123,BOYET,"They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus."
54896,54897,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,5.2.124,BOYET,"Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess."
54897,54898,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,5.2.125,BOYET,"Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance,"
54898,54899,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,5.2.126,BOYET,And every one his love-feat will advance
54899,54900,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,5.2.127,BOYET,"Unto his several mistress, which they'll know"
54900,54901,Loves Labours Lost,44.0,5.2.128,BOYET,By favours several which they did bestow.
54901,54902,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.129,PRINCESS,"And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd,"
54902,54903,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.130,PRINCESS,"For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd,"
54903,54904,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.131,PRINCESS,"And not a man of them shall have the grace,"
54904,54905,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.132,PRINCESS,"Despite of suit, to see a lady's face."
54905,54906,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.133,PRINCESS,"Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,"
54906,54907,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.134,PRINCESS,"And then the king will court thee for his dear,"
54907,54908,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.135,PRINCESS,"Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,"
54908,54909,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.136,PRINCESS,So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
54909,54910,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.137,PRINCESS,"And change your favours too, so shall your loves"
54910,54911,Loves Labours Lost,45.0,5.2.138,PRINCESS,"Woo contrary, deceived by these removes."
54911,54912,Loves Labours Lost,46.0,5.2.139,ROSALINE,"Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight."
54912,54913,Loves Labours Lost,47.0,5.2.140,KATHARINE,But in this changing what is your intent?
54913,54914,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,5.2.141,PRINCESS,The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
54914,54915,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,5.2.142,PRINCESS,"They do it but in mocking merriment,"
54915,54916,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,5.2.143,PRINCESS,And mock for mock is only my intent.
54916,54917,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,5.2.144,PRINCESS,Their several counsels they unbosom shall
54917,54918,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,5.2.145,PRINCESS,"To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal"
54918,54919,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,5.2.146,PRINCESS,"Upon the next occasion that we meet,"
54919,54920,Loves Labours Lost,48.0,5.2.147,PRINCESS,"With visages displayed, to talk and greet."
54920,54921,Loves Labours Lost,49.0,5.2.148,ROSALINE,"But shall we dance, if they desire to't?"
54921,54922,Loves Labours Lost,50.0,5.2.149,PRINCESS,"No, to the death, we will not move a foot,"
54922,54923,Loves Labours Lost,50.0,5.2.150,PRINCESS,"Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,"
54923,54924,Loves Labours Lost,50.0,5.2.151,PRINCESS,But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
54924,54925,Loves Labours Lost,51.0,5.2.152,BOYET,"Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,"
54925,54926,Loves Labours Lost,51.0,5.2.153,BOYET,And quite divorce his memory from his part.
54926,54927,Loves Labours Lost,52.0,5.2.154,PRINCESS,"Therefore I do it, and I make no doubt"
54927,54928,Loves Labours Lost,52.0,5.2.155,PRINCESS,"The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out"
54928,54929,Loves Labours Lost,52.0,5.2.156,PRINCESS,"There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,"
54929,54930,Loves Labours Lost,52.0,5.2.157,PRINCESS,To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
54930,54931,Loves Labours Lost,52.0,5.2.158,PRINCESS,"So shall we stay, mocking intended game,"
54931,54932,Loves Labours Lost,52.0,5.2.159,PRINCESS,"And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame."
54932,54933,Loves Labours Lost,52.0,,PRINCESS,Trumpets sound within
54933,54934,Loves Labours Lost,53.0,5.2.160,BOYET,"The trumpet sounds: be mask'd, the maskers come."
54934,54935,Loves Labours Lost,53.0,,BOYET,The Ladies mask
54935,54936,Loves Labours Lost,53.0,,BOYET,"Enter Blackamoors with music, MOTH, FERDINAND,  BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked"
54936,54937,Loves Labours Lost,54.0,5.2.161,MOTH,"All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--"
54937,54938,Loves Labours Lost,55.0,5.2.162,BOYET,Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
54938,54939,Loves Labours Lost,56.0,5.2.163,MOTH,A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
54939,54940,Loves Labours Lost,56.0,,MOTH,The Ladies turn their backs to him
54940,54941,Loves Labours Lost,56.0,5.2.164,MOTH,That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
54941,54942,Loves Labours Lost,57.0,5.2.165,BIRON,"[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!"
54942,54943,Loves Labours Lost,58.0,5.2.166,MOTH,That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
54943,54944,Loves Labours Lost,59.0,5.2.167,BOYET,"True, out indeed."
54944,54945,Loves Labours Lost,60.0,5.2.168,MOTH,"Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe"
54945,54946,Loves Labours Lost,60.0,5.2.169,MOTH,Not to behold--
54946,54947,Loves Labours Lost,61.0,5.2.170,BIRON,"[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue."
54947,54948,Loves Labours Lost,62.0,5.2.171,MOTH,"Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,"
54948,54949,Loves Labours Lost,62.0,5.2.172,MOTH,--with your sun-beamed eyes--
54949,54950,Loves Labours Lost,63.0,5.2.173,BOYET,"They will not answer to that epithet,"
54950,54951,Loves Labours Lost,63.0,5.2.174,BOYET,You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
54951,54952,Loves Labours Lost,64.0,5.2.175,MOTH,"They do not mark me, and that brings me out."
54952,54953,Loves Labours Lost,65.0,5.2.176,BIRON,"Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!"
54953,54954,Loves Labours Lost,65.0,,BIRON,Exit MOTH
54954,54955,Loves Labours Lost,66.0,5.2.177,ROSALINE,"What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:"
54955,54956,Loves Labours Lost,66.0,5.2.178,ROSALINE,"If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:"
54956,54957,Loves Labours Lost,66.0,5.2.179,ROSALINE,That some plain man recount their purposes
54957,54958,Loves Labours Lost,66.0,5.2.180,ROSALINE,Know what they would.
54958,54959,Loves Labours Lost,67.0,5.2.181,BOYET,What would you with the princess?
54959,54960,Loves Labours Lost,68.0,5.2.182,BIRON,Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
54960,54961,Loves Labours Lost,69.0,5.2.183,ROSALINE,"What would they, say they?"
54961,54962,Loves Labours Lost,70.0,5.2.184,BOYET,Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
54962,54963,Loves Labours Lost,71.0,5.2.185,ROSALINE,"Why, that they have, and bid them so be gone."
54963,54964,Loves Labours Lost,72.0,5.2.186,BOYET,"She says, you have it, and you may be gone."
54964,54965,Loves Labours Lost,73.0,5.2.187,FERDINAND,"Say to her, we have measured many miles"
54965,54966,Loves Labours Lost,73.0,5.2.188,FERDINAND,To tread a measure with her on this grass.
54966,54967,Loves Labours Lost,74.0,5.2.189,BOYET,"They say, that they have measured many a mile"
54967,54968,Loves Labours Lost,74.0,5.2.190,BOYET,To tread a measure with you on this grass.
54968,54969,Loves Labours Lost,75.0,5.2.191,ROSALINE,It is not so. Ask them how many inches
54969,54970,Loves Labours Lost,75.0,5.2.192,ROSALINE,"Is in one mile: if they have measured many,"
54970,54971,Loves Labours Lost,75.0,5.2.193,ROSALINE,The measure then of one is easily told.
54971,54972,Loves Labours Lost,76.0,5.2.194,BOYET,"If to come hither you have measured miles,"
54972,54973,Loves Labours Lost,76.0,5.2.195,BOYET,"And many miles, the princess bids you tell"
54973,54974,Loves Labours Lost,76.0,5.2.196,BOYET,How many inches doth fill up one mile.
54974,54975,Loves Labours Lost,77.0,5.2.197,BIRON,"Tell her, we measure them by weary steps."
54975,54976,Loves Labours Lost,78.0,5.2.198,BOYET,She hears herself.
54976,54977,Loves Labours Lost,79.0,5.2.199,ROSALINE,"How many weary steps,"
54977,54978,Loves Labours Lost,79.0,5.2.200,ROSALINE,"Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,"
54978,54979,Loves Labours Lost,79.0,5.2.201,ROSALINE,Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
54979,54980,Loves Labours Lost,80.0,5.2.202,BIRON,We number nothing that we spend for you:
54980,54981,Loves Labours Lost,80.0,5.2.203,BIRON,"Our duty is so rich, so infinite,"
54981,54982,Loves Labours Lost,80.0,5.2.204,BIRON,That we may do it still without accompt.
54982,54983,Loves Labours Lost,80.0,5.2.205,BIRON,"Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,"
54983,54984,Loves Labours Lost,80.0,5.2.206,BIRON,"That we, like savages, may worship it."
54984,54985,Loves Labours Lost,81.0,5.2.207,ROSALINE,"My face is but a moon, and clouded too."
54985,54986,Loves Labours Lost,82.0,5.2.208,FERDINAND,"Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!"
54986,54987,Loves Labours Lost,82.0,5.2.209,FERDINAND,"Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,"
54987,54988,Loves Labours Lost,82.0,5.2.210,FERDINAND,"Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne."
54988,54989,Loves Labours Lost,83.0,5.2.211,ROSALINE,"O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter,"
54989,54990,Loves Labours Lost,83.0,5.2.212,ROSALINE,Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
54990,54991,Loves Labours Lost,84.0,5.2.213,FERDINAND,"Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change."
54991,54992,Loves Labours Lost,84.0,5.2.214,FERDINAND,Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
54992,54993,Loves Labours Lost,85.0,5.2.215,ROSALINE,"Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon."
54993,54994,Loves Labours Lost,85.0,,ROSALINE,Music plays
54994,54995,Loves Labours Lost,85.0,5.2.216,ROSALINE,Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
54995,54996,Loves Labours Lost,86.0,5.2.217,FERDINAND,Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
54996,54997,Loves Labours Lost,87.0,5.2.218,ROSALINE,"You took the moon at full, but now she's changed."
54997,54998,Loves Labours Lost,88.0,5.2.219,FERDINAND,"Yet still she is the moon, and I the man."
54998,54999,Loves Labours Lost,88.0,5.2.220,FERDINAND,"The music plays, vouchsafe some motion to it."
54999,55000,Loves Labours Lost,89.0,5.2.221,ROSALINE,Our ears vouchsafe it.
55000,55001,Loves Labours Lost,90.0,5.2.222,FERDINAND,But your legs should do it.
55001,55002,Loves Labours Lost,91.0,5.2.223,ROSALINE,"Since you are strangers and come here by chance,"
55002,55003,Loves Labours Lost,91.0,5.2.224,ROSALINE,We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
55003,55004,Loves Labours Lost,92.0,5.2.225,FERDINAND,"Why take we hands, then?"
55004,55005,Loves Labours Lost,93.0,5.2.226,ROSALINE,Only to part friends:
55005,55006,Loves Labours Lost,93.0,5.2.227,ROSALINE,"Curtsy, sweet hearts, and so the measure ends."
55006,55007,Loves Labours Lost,94.0,5.2.228,FERDINAND,"More measure of this measure, be not nice."
55007,55008,Loves Labours Lost,95.0,5.2.229,ROSALINE,We can afford no more at such a price.
55008,55009,Loves Labours Lost,96.0,5.2.230,FERDINAND,Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
55009,55010,Loves Labours Lost,97.0,5.2.231,ROSALINE,Your absence only.
55010,55011,Loves Labours Lost,98.0,5.2.232,FERDINAND,That can never be.
55011,55012,Loves Labours Lost,99.0,5.2.233,ROSALINE,"Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu,"
55012,55013,Loves Labours Lost,99.0,5.2.234,ROSALINE,"Twice to your visor, and half once to you."
55013,55014,Loves Labours Lost,100.0,5.2.235,FERDINAND,"If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat."
55014,55015,Loves Labours Lost,101.0,5.2.236,ROSALINE,"In private, then."
55015,55016,Loves Labours Lost,102.0,5.2.237,FERDINAND,I am best pleased with that.
55016,55017,Loves Labours Lost,102.0,,FERDINAND,They converse apart
55017,55018,Loves Labours Lost,103.0,5.2.238,BIRON,"White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee."
55018,55019,Loves Labours Lost,104.0,5.2.239,PRINCESS,"Honey, and milk, and sugar, there is three."
55019,55020,Loves Labours Lost,105.0,5.2.240,BIRON,"Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,"
55020,55021,Loves Labours Lost,105.0,5.2.241,BIRON,"Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!"
55021,55022,Loves Labours Lost,105.0,5.2.242,BIRON,There's half-a-dozen sweets.
55022,55023,Loves Labours Lost,106.0,5.2.243,PRINCESS,"Seventh sweet, adieu:"
55023,55024,Loves Labours Lost,106.0,5.2.244,PRINCESS,"Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you."
55024,55025,Loves Labours Lost,107.0,5.2.245,BIRON,One word in secret.
55025,55026,Loves Labours Lost,108.0,5.2.246,PRINCESS,Let it not be sweet.
55026,55027,Loves Labours Lost,109.0,5.2.247,BIRON,Thou grievest my gall.
55027,55028,Loves Labours Lost,110.0,5.2.248,PRINCESS,Gall! bitter.
55028,55029,Loves Labours Lost,111.0,5.2.249,BIRON,Therefore meet.
55029,55030,Loves Labours Lost,111.0,,BIRON,They converse apart
55030,55031,Loves Labours Lost,112.0,5.2.250,DUMAIN,Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
55031,55032,Loves Labours Lost,113.0,5.2.251,MARIA,Name it.
55032,55033,Loves Labours Lost,114.0,5.2.252,DUMAIN,"Fair lady,--"

55034,55035,Loves Labours Lost,115.0,5.2.254,MARIA,Take that for your fair lady.
55035,55036,Loves Labours Lost,116.0,5.2.255,DUMAIN,"Please it you,"
55036,55037,Loves Labours Lost,116.0,5.2.256,DUMAIN,"As much in private, and I'll bid adieu."
55037,55038,Loves Labours Lost,116.0,,DUMAIN,They converse apart
55038,55039,Loves Labours Lost,117.0,5.2.257,KATHARINE,"What, was your vizard made without a tongue?"
55039,55040,Loves Labours Lost,118.0,5.2.258,LONGAVILLE,"I know the reason, lady, why you ask."
55040,55041,Loves Labours Lost,119.0,5.2.259,KATHARINE,"O for your reason! quickly, sir, I long."
55041,55042,Loves Labours Lost,120.0,5.2.260,LONGAVILLE,"You have a double tongue within your mask,"
55042,55043,Loves Labours Lost,120.0,5.2.261,LONGAVILLE,And would afford my speechless vizard half.
55043,55044,Loves Labours Lost,121.0,5.2.262,KATHARINE,"Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?"
55044,55045,Loves Labours Lost,122.0,5.2.263,LONGAVILLE,"A calf, fair lady!"
55045,55046,Loves Labours Lost,123.0,5.2.264,KATHARINE,"No, a fair lord calf."
55046,55047,Loves Labours Lost,124.0,5.2.265,LONGAVILLE,Let's part the word.
55047,55048,Loves Labours Lost,125.0,5.2.266,KATHARINE,"No, I'll not be your half"
55048,55049,Loves Labours Lost,125.0,5.2.267,KATHARINE,"Take all, and wean it, it may prove an ox."
55049,55050,Loves Labours Lost,126.0,5.2.268,LONGAVILLE,"Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!"
55050,55051,Loves Labours Lost,126.0,5.2.269,LONGAVILLE,"Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so."

55074,55075,Loves Labours Lost,138.0,5.2.291,ROSALINE,The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
55075,55076,Loves Labours Lost,139.0,5.2.292,PRINCESS,Biron did swear himself out of all suit.

55126,55127,Loves Labours Lost,162.0,5.2.340,BIRON,Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
55127,55128,Loves Labours Lost,162.0,5.2.341,BIRON,"This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve,"

55166,55167,Loves Labours Lost,174.0,5.2.379,PRINCESS,"Not so, my lord, it is not so, I swear,"
55167,55168,Loves Labours Lost,174.0,5.2.380,PRINCESS,We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:

55174,55175,Loves Labours Lost,177.0,5.2.387,ROSALINE,In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
55175,55176,Loves Labours Lost,177.0,5.2.388,ROSALINE,We four indeed confronted were with four
55176,55177,Loves Labours Lost,177.0,5.2.389,ROSALINE,"In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,"
55177,55178,Loves Labours Lost,177.0,5.2.390,ROSALINE,"And talk'd apace, and in that hour, my lord,"
55178,55179,Loves Labours Lost,177.0,5.2.391,ROSALINE,They did not bless us with one happy word.
55179,55180,Loves Labours Lost,177.0,5.2.392,ROSALINE,"I dare not call them fools, but this I think,"

55184,55185,Loves Labours Lost,178.0,5.2.397,BIRON,By light we lose light: your capacity
55185,55186,Loves Labours Lost,178.0,5.2.398,BIRON,Is of that nature that to your huge store
55186,55187,Loves Labours Lost,178.0,5.2.399,BIRON,Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
55187,55188,Loves Labours Lost,179.0,5.2.400,ROSALINE,"This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--"

55189,55190,Loves Labours Lost,181.0,5.2.402,ROSALINE,"But that you take what doth to you belong,"
55190,55191,Loves Labours Lost,181.0,5.2.403,ROSALINE,It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
55191,55192,Loves Labours Lost,182.0,5.2.404,BIRON,"O, I am yours, and all that I possess!"
55192,55193,Loves Labours Lost,183.0,5.2.405,ROSALINE,All the fool mine?
55193,55194,Loves Labours Lost,184.0,5.2.406,BIRON,I cannot give you less.
55194,55195,Loves Labours Lost,185.0,5.2.407,ROSALINE,Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
55195,55196,Loves Labours Lost,186.0,5.2.408,BIRON,Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
55196,55197,Loves Labours Lost,187.0,5.2.409,ROSALINE,"There, then, that vizard, that superfluous case"
55197,55198,Loves Labours Lost,187.0,5.2.410,ROSALINE,That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
55198,55199,Loves Labours Lost,188.0,5.2.411,FERDINAND,"We are descried, they'll mock us now downright."
55199,55200,Loves Labours Lost,189.0,5.2.412,DUMAIN,Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
55200,55201,Loves Labours Lost,190.0,5.2.413,PRINCESS,"Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?"
55201,55202,Loves Labours Lost,191.0,5.2.414,ROSALINE,"Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?"
55202,55203,Loves Labours Lost,191.0,5.2.415,ROSALINE,"Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy."
55203,55204,Loves Labours Lost,192.0,5.2.416,BIRON,Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
55204,55205,Loves Labours Lost,192.0,5.2.417,BIRON,Can any face of brass hold longer out?
55205,55206,Loves Labours Lost,193.0,5.2.418,BIRON,"lady, dart thy skill at me,"

55557,55558,Loves Labours Lost,359.0,5.2.755,PRINCESS,"Welcome, Mercade,"
55558,55559,Loves Labours Lost,359.0,5.2.756,PRINCESS,But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
55559,55560,Loves Labours Lost,360.0,5.2.757,MERCADE,"I am sorry, madam, for the news I bring"
55560,55561,Loves Labours Lost,360.0,5.2.758,MERCADE,Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
55561,55562,Loves Labours Lost,361.0,5.2.759,PRINCESS,"Dead, for my life!"
55562,55563,Loves Labours Lost,362.0,5.2.760,MERCADE,"Even so, my tale is told."
55563,55564,Loves Labours Lost,363.0,5.2.761,BIRON,"Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud."

55566,55567,Loves Labours Lost,364.0,5.2.764,ADRIANO DE ARMADO,seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
55567,55568,Loves Labours Lost,364.0,5.2.765,ADRIANO DE ARMADO,"discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier."
55568,55569,Loves Labours Lost,364.0,,ADRIANO DE ARMADO,Exeunt Worthies
55569,55570,Loves Labours Lost,365.0,5.2.766,FERDINAND,How fares your majesty?
55570,55571,Loves Labours Lost,366.0,5.2.767,PRINCESS,"Boyet, prepare, I will away tonight."
55571,55572,Loves Labours Lost,367.0,5.2.768,FERDINAND,"Madam, not so, I do beseech you, stay."
55572,55573,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.769,PRINCESS,"Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,"
55573,55574,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.770,PRINCESS,"For all your fair endeavors, and entreat,"
55574,55575,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.771,PRINCESS,"Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe"
55575,55576,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.772,PRINCESS,In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
55576,55577,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.773,PRINCESS,"The liberal opposition of our spirits,"
55577,55578,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.774,PRINCESS,If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
55578,55579,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.775,PRINCESS,In the converse of breath: your gentleness
55579,55580,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.776,PRINCESS,Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
55580,55581,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.777,PRINCESS,A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
55581,55582,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.778,PRINCESS,"Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks"
55582,55583,Loves Labours Lost,368.0,5.2.779,PRINCESS,For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
55583,55584,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.780,FERDINAND,The extreme parts of time extremely forms
55584,55585,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.781,FERDINAND,"All causes to the purpose of his speed,"
55585,55586,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.782,FERDINAND,And often at his very loose decides
55586,55587,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.783,FERDINAND,That which long process could not arbitrate:
55587,55588,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.784,FERDINAND,And though the mourning brow of progeny
55588,55589,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.785,FERDINAND,Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
55589,55590,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.786,FERDINAND,"The holy suit which fain it would convince,"
55590,55591,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.787,FERDINAND,"Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,"
55591,55592,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.788,FERDINAND,Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
55592,55593,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.789,FERDINAND,"From what it purposed, since, to wail friends lost"
55593,55594,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.790,FERDINAND,Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
55594,55595,Loves Labours Lost,369.0,5.2.791,FERDINAND,As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
55595,55596,Loves Labours Lost,370.0,5.2.792,PRINCESS,I understand you not: my griefs are double.
55596,55597,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.793,BIRON,"Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief,"
55597,55598,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.794,BIRON,And by these badges understand the king.
55598,55599,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.795,BIRON,"For your fair sakes have we neglected time,"
55599,55600,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.796,BIRON,"Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,"
55600,55601,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.797,BIRON,"Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours"
55601,55602,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.798,BIRON,Even to the opposed end of our intents:
55602,55603,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.799,BIRON,"And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--"
55603,55604,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.800,BIRON,"As love is full of unbefitting strains,"
55604,55605,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.801,BIRON,"All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,"
55605,55606,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.802,BIRON,"Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,"
55606,55607,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.803,BIRON,"Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,"
55607,55608,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.804,BIRON,Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
55608,55609,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.805,BIRON,To every varied object in his glance:
55609,55610,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.806,BIRON,Which parti-coated presence of loose love
55610,55611,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.807,BIRON,"Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,"
55611,55612,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.808,BIRON,"Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,"
55612,55613,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.809,BIRON,"Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,"
55613,55614,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.810,BIRON,"Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,"
55614,55615,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.811,BIRON,"Our love being yours, the error that love makes"
55615,55616,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.812,BIRON,"Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,"
55616,55617,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.813,BIRON,By being once false for ever to be true
55617,55618,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.814,BIRON,"To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:"
55618,55619,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.815,BIRON,"And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,"
55619,55620,Loves Labours Lost,371.0,5.2.816,BIRON,Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
55620,55621,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.817,PRINCESS,"We have received your letters full of love,"
55621,55622,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.818,PRINCESS,"Your favours, the ambassadors of love,"
55622,55623,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.819,PRINCESS,"And, in our maiden council, rated them"
55623,55624,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.820,PRINCESS,"At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,"
55624,55625,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.821,PRINCESS,As bombast and as lining to the time:
55625,55626,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.822,PRINCESS,But more devout than this in our respects
55626,55627,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.823,PRINCESS,"Have we not been, and therefore met your loves"
55627,55628,Loves Labours Lost,372.0,5.2.824,PRINCESS,"In their own fashion, like a merriment."
55628,55629,Loves Labours Lost,373.0,5.2.825,DUMAIN,"Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest."
55629,55630,Loves Labours Lost,374.0,5.2.826,LONGAVILLE,So did our looks.
55630,55631,Loves Labours Lost,375.0,5.2.827,ROSALINE,We did not quote them so.
55631,55632,Loves Labours Lost,376.0,5.2.828,FERDINAND,"Now, at the latest minute of the hour,"
55632,55633,Loves Labours Lost,376.0,5.2.829,FERDINAND,Grant us your loves.
55633,55634,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.830,PRINCESS,"A time, methinks, too short"
55634,55635,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.831,PRINCESS,To make a world-without-end bargain in.
55635,55636,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.832,PRINCESS,"No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,"
55636,55637,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.833,PRINCESS,"Full of dear guiltiness, and therefore this:"
55637,55638,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.834,PRINCESS,"If for my love, as there is no such cause,"
55638,55639,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.835,PRINCESS,"You will do aught, this shall you do for me:"
55639,55640,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.836,PRINCESS,"Your oath I will not trust, but go with speed"
55640,55641,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.837,PRINCESS,"To some forlorn and naked hermitage,"
55641,55642,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.838,PRINCESS,"Remote from all the pleasures of the world,"
55642,55643,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.839,PRINCESS,There stay until the twelve celestial signs
55643,55644,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.840,PRINCESS,Have brought about the annual reckoning.
55644,55645,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.841,PRINCESS,If this austere insociable life
55645,55646,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.842,PRINCESS,"Change not your offer made in heat of blood,"
55646,55647,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.843,PRINCESS,"If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds"
55647,55648,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.844,PRINCESS,"Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,"
55648,55649,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.845,PRINCESS,"But that it bear this trial and last love,"
55649,55650,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.846,PRINCESS,"Then, at the expiration of the year,"
55650,55651,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.847,PRINCESS,"Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,"
55651,55652,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.848,PRINCESS,"And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine"
55652,55653,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.849,PRINCESS,"I will be thine, and till that instant shut"
55653,55654,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.850,PRINCESS,"My woeful self up in a mourning house,"
55654,55655,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.851,PRINCESS,Raining the tears of lamentation
55655,55656,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.852,PRINCESS,For the remembrance of my father's death.
55656,55657,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.853,PRINCESS,"If this thou do deny, let our hands part,"
55657,55658,Loves Labours Lost,377.0,5.2.854,PRINCESS,Neither entitled in the other's heart.
55658,55659,Loves Labours Lost,378.0,5.2.855,FERDINAND,"If this, or more than this, I would deny,"
55659,55660,Loves Labours Lost,378.0,5.2.856,FERDINAND,"To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,"
55660,55661,Loves Labours Lost,378.0,5.2.857,FERDINAND,The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
55661,55662,Loves Labours Lost,378.0,5.2.858,FERDINAND,Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
55662,55663,Loves Labours Lost,379.0,5.2.859,DUMAIN,"But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?"
55663,55664,Loves Labours Lost,380.0,5.2.860,KATHARINE,"A beard, fair health, and honesty,"
55664,55665,Loves Labours Lost,380.0,5.2.861,KATHARINE,With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
55665,55666,Loves Labours Lost,381.0,5.2.862,DUMAIN,"O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?"
55666,55667,Loves Labours Lost,382.0,5.2.863,KATHARINE,"Not so, my lord, a twelvemonth and a day"
55667,55668,Loves Labours Lost,382.0,5.2.864,KATHARINE,I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
55668,55669,Loves Labours Lost,382.0,5.2.865,KATHARINE,"Come when the king doth to my lady come,"
55669,55670,Loves Labours Lost,382.0,5.2.866,KATHARINE,"Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some."
55670,55671,Loves Labours Lost,383.0,5.2.867,DUMAIN,I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
55671,55672,Loves Labours Lost,384.0,5.2.868,KATHARINE,"Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again."
55672,55673,Loves Labours Lost,385.0,5.2.869,LONGAVILLE,What says Maria?
55673,55674,Loves Labours Lost,386.0,5.2.870,MARIA,At the twelvemonth's end
55674,55675,Loves Labours Lost,386.0,5.2.871,MARIA,I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
55675,55676,Loves Labours Lost,387.0,5.2.872,LONGAVILLE,"I'll stay with patience, but the time is long."
55676,55677,Loves Labours Lost,388.0,5.2.873,MARIA,"The liker you, few taller are so young."
55677,55678,Loves Labours Lost,389.0,5.2.874,BIRON,"Studies my lady? mistress, look on me,"
55678,55679,Loves Labours Lost,389.0,5.2.875,BIRON,"Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,"
55679,55680,Loves Labours Lost,389.0,5.2.876,BIRON,What humble suit attends thy answer there:
55680,55681,Loves Labours Lost,389.0,5.2.877,BIRON,Impose some service on me for thy love.
55681,55682,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.878,ROSALINE,"Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,"
55682,55683,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.879,ROSALINE,"Before I saw you, and the world's large tongue"
55683,55684,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.880,ROSALINE,"Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,"
55684,55685,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.881,ROSALINE,"Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,"
55685,55686,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.882,ROSALINE,Which you on all estates will execute
55686,55687,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.883,ROSALINE,That lie within the mercy of your wit.
55687,55688,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.884,ROSALINE,"To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,"
55688,55689,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.885,ROSALINE,"And therewithal to win me, if you please,"
55689,55690,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.886,ROSALINE,"Without the which I am not to be won,"
55690,55691,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.887,ROSALINE,You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
55691,55692,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.888,ROSALINE,Visit the speechless sick and still converse
55692,55693,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.889,ROSALINE,"With groaning wretches, and your task shall be,"
55693,55694,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.890,ROSALINE,With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
55694,55695,Loves Labours Lost,390.0,5.2.891,ROSALINE,To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
55695,55696,Loves Labours Lost,391.0,5.2.892,BIRON,To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
55696,55697,Loves Labours Lost,391.0,5.2.893,BIRON,"It cannot be, it is impossible:"
55697,55698,Loves Labours Lost,391.0,5.2.894,BIRON,Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
55698,55699,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.895,ROSALINE,"Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,"
55699,55700,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.896,ROSALINE,Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
55700,55701,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.897,ROSALINE,Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
55701,55702,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.898,ROSALINE,A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
55702,55703,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.899,ROSALINE,"Of him that hears it, never in the tongue"
55703,55704,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.900,ROSALINE,"Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,"
55704,55705,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.901,ROSALINE,"Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,"
55705,55706,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.902,ROSALINE,"Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,"
55706,55707,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.903,ROSALINE,"And I will have you and that fault withal,"
55707,55708,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.904,ROSALINE,"But if they will not, throw away that spirit,"
55708,55709,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.905,ROSALINE,"And I shall find you empty of that fault,"
55709,55710,Loves Labours Lost,392.0,5.2.906,ROSALINE,Right joyful of your reformation.
55710,55711,Loves Labours Lost,393.0,5.2.907,BIRON,"A twelvemonth! well, befall what will befall,"
55711,55712,Loves Labours Lost,393.0,5.2.908,BIRON,I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
55712,55713,Loves Labours Lost,394.0,5.2.909,PRINCESS,"[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave."
55713,55714,Loves Labours Lost,395.0,5.2.910,FERDINAND,"No, madam, we will bring you on your way."
55714,55715,Loves Labours Lost,396.0,5.2.911,BIRON,"Our wooing doth not end like an old play,"
55715,55716,Loves Labours Lost,396.0,5.2.912,BIRON,Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
55716,55717,Loves Labours Lost,396.0,5.2.913,BIRON,Might well have made our sport a comedy.
55717,55718,Loves Labours Lost,397.0,5.2.914,FERDINAND,"Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,"
55718,55719,Loves Labours Lost,397.0,5.2.915,FERDINAND,And then 'twill end.
55719,55720,Loves Labours Lost,398.0,5.2.916,BIRON,That's too long for a play.
55720,55721,Loves Labours Lost,398.0,,BIRON,Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO

96967,96968,Titus Andronicus,105.0,1.1.471,TAMORA,And must advise the emperor for his good.
96968,96969,Titus Andronicus,105.0,1.1.472,TAMORA,"This day all quarrels die, Andronicus,"
96969,96970,Titus Andronicus,105.0,1.1.473,TAMORA,"And let it be mine honour, good my lord,"
96970,96971,Titus Andronicus,105.0,1.1.474,TAMORA,That I have reconciled your friends and you.

96985,96986,Titus Andronicus,110.0,1.1.489,SATURNINUS,"Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,"
96986,96987,Titus Andronicus,110.0,1.1.490,SATURNINUS,"And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,"
96987,96988,Titus Andronicus,110.0,1.1.491,SATURNINUS,I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.
96988,96989,Titus Andronicus,110.0,1.1.492,SATURNINUS,"Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,"
96989,96990,Titus Andronicus,110.0,1.1.493,SATURNINUS,"I found a friend, and sure as death I swore"
96990,96991,Titus Andronicus,110.0,1.1.494,SATURNINUS,I would not part a bachelor from the priest.

97000,97001,Titus Andronicus,112.0,,SATURNINUS,SCENE I. Rome. Before the Palace.
97001,97002,Titus Andronicus,112.0,,SATURNINUS,Enter AARON
97002,97003,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.1,AARON,"Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,"
97003,97004,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.2,AARON,"Safe out of fortune's shot, and sits aloft,"
97004,97005,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.3,AARON,"Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,"
97005,97006,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.4,AARON,Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
97006,97007,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.5,AARON,"As when the golden sun salutes the morn,"
97007,97008,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.6,AARON,"And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,"
97008,97009,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.7,AARON,"Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,"
97009,97010,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.8,AARON,"And overlooks the highest-peering hills,"
97010,97011,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.9,AARON,So Tamora:
97011,97012,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.10,AARON,"Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,"
97012,97013,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.11,AARON,And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
97013,97014,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.12,AARON,"Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,"
97014,97015,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.13,AARON,"To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,"
97015,97016,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.14,AARON,"And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long"
97016,97017,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.15,AARON,"Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains"
97017,97018,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.16,AARON,And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
97018,97019,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.17,AARON,Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
97019,97020,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.18,AARON,Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
97020,97021,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.19,AARON,"I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,"
97021,97022,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.20,AARON,To wait upon this new-made empress.
97022,97023,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.21,AARON,"To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,"
97023,97024,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.22,AARON,"This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,"
97024,97025,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.23,AARON,"This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,"
97025,97026,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.24,AARON,And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
97026,97027,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.1.25,AARON,Holloa! what storm is this?
97027,97028,Titus Andronicus,1.0,,AARON,"Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving"
97028,97029,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.1.26,DEMETRIUS,"Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,"
97029,97030,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.1.27,DEMETRIUS,"And manners, to intrude where I am graced,"
97030,97031,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.1.28,DEMETRIUS,"And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be."
97031,97032,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.29,CHIRON,"Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all,"
97032,97033,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.30,CHIRON,"And so in this, to bear me down with braves."
97033,97034,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.31,CHIRON,'Tis not the difference of a year or two
97034,97035,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.32,CHIRON,Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
97035,97036,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.33,CHIRON,I am as able and as fit as thou
97036,97037,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.34,CHIRON,"To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace,"
97037,97038,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.35,CHIRON,"And that my sword upon thee shall approve,"
97038,97039,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.1.36,CHIRON,And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
97039,97040,Titus Andronicus,4.0,2.1.37,AARON,"[Aside]  Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep"
97040,97041,Titus Andronicus,4.0,2.1.38,AARON,the peace.
97041,97042,Titus Andronicus,5.0,2.1.39,DEMETRIUS,"Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,"
97042,97043,Titus Andronicus,5.0,2.1.40,DEMETRIUS,"Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,"
97043,97044,Titus Andronicus,5.0,2.1.41,DEMETRIUS,"Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?"
97044,97045,Titus Andronicus,5.0,2.1.42,DEMETRIUS,"Go to, have your lath glued within your sheath"
97045,97046,Titus Andronicus,5.0,2.1.43,DEMETRIUS,Till you know better how to handle it.
97046,97047,Titus Andronicus,6.0,2.1.44,CHIRON,"Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,"
97047,97048,Titus Andronicus,6.0,2.1.45,CHIRON,Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
97048,97049,Titus Andronicus,7.0,2.1.46,DEMETRIUS,"Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?"
97049,97050,Titus Andronicus,7.0,,DEMETRIUS,They draw
97050,97051,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.47,AARON,"[Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!"
97051,97052,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.48,AARON,"So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,"
97052,97053,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.49,AARON,And maintain such a quarrel openly?
97053,97054,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.50,AARON,Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
97054,97055,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.51,AARON,I would not for a million of gold
97055,97056,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.52,AARON,"The cause were known to them it most concerns,"
97056,97057,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.53,AARON,Nor would your noble mother for much more
97057,97058,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.54,AARON,Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.
97058,97059,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.1.55,AARON,"For shame, put up."
97059,97060,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.1.56,DEMETRIUS,"Not I, till I have sheathed"
97060,97061,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.1.57,DEMETRIUS,My rapier in his bosom and withal
97061,97062,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.1.58,DEMETRIUS,Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
97062,97063,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.1.59,DEMETRIUS,That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.
97063,97064,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.1.60,CHIRON,For that I am prepared and full resolved.
97064,97065,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.1.61,CHIRON,"Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,"
97065,97066,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.1.62,CHIRON,And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
97066,97067,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.63,AARON,"Away, I say!"
97067,97068,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.64,AARON,"Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,"
97068,97069,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.65,AARON,This petty brabble will undo us all.
97069,97070,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.66,AARON,"Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous"
97070,97071,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.67,AARON,It is to jet upon a prince's right?
97071,97072,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.68,AARON,"What, is Lavinia then become so loose,"
97072,97073,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.69,AARON,"Or Bassianus so degenerate,"
97073,97074,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.70,AARON,That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
97074,97075,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.71,AARON,"Without controlment, justice, or revenge?"
97075,97076,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.72,AARON,"Young lords, beware! and should the empress know"
97076,97077,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.1.73,AARON,"This discord's ground, the music would not please."
97077,97078,Titus Andronicus,12.0,2.1.74,CHIRON,"I care not, I, knew she and all the world:"
97078,97079,Titus Andronicus,12.0,2.1.75,CHIRON,I love Lavinia more than all the world.
97079,97080,Titus Andronicus,13.0,2.1.76,DEMETRIUS,"Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:"
97080,97081,Titus Andronicus,13.0,2.1.77,DEMETRIUS,Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
97081,97082,Titus Andronicus,14.0,2.1.78,AARON,"Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome"
97082,97083,Titus Andronicus,14.0,2.1.79,AARON,"How furious and impatient they be,"
97083,97084,Titus Andronicus,14.0,2.1.80,AARON,And cannot brook competitors in love?
97084,97085,Titus Andronicus,14.0,2.1.81,AARON,"I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths"
97085,97086,Titus Andronicus,14.0,2.1.82,AARON,By this device.
97086,97087,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.1.83,CHIRON,"Aaron, a thousand deaths"
97087,97088,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.1.84,CHIRON,Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
97088,97089,Titus Andronicus,16.0,2.1.85,AARON,To achieve her! how?
97089,97090,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.86,DEMETRIUS,Why makest thou it so strange?
97090,97091,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.87,DEMETRIUS,"She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd,"
97091,97092,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.88,DEMETRIUS,"She is a woman, therefore may be won,"
97092,97093,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.89,DEMETRIUS,"She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved."
97093,97094,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.90,DEMETRIUS,"What, man! more water glideth by the mill"
97094,97095,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.91,DEMETRIUS,"Than wots the miller of, and easy it is"
97095,97096,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.92,DEMETRIUS,"Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:"
97096,97097,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.93,DEMETRIUS,Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
97097,97098,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.1.94,DEMETRIUS,Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
97098,97099,Titus Andronicus,18.0,2.1.95,AARON,"[Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may."
97099,97100,Titus Andronicus,19.0,2.1.96,DEMETRIUS,Then why should he despair that knows to court it
97100,97101,Titus Andronicus,19.0,2.1.97,DEMETRIUS,"With words, fair looks and liberality?"
97101,97102,Titus Andronicus,19.0,2.1.98,DEMETRIUS,"What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,"
97102,97103,Titus Andronicus,19.0,2.1.99,DEMETRIUS,And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
97103,97104,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.1.100,AARON,"Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so"
97104,97105,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.1.101,AARON,Would serve your turns.
97105,97106,Titus Andronicus,21.0,2.1.102,CHIRON,"Ay, so the turn were served."
97106,97107,Titus Andronicus,22.0,2.1.103,DEMETRIUS,"Aaron, thou hast hit it."
97107,97108,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.1.104,AARON,Would you had hit it too!
97108,97109,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.1.105,AARON,Then should not we be tired with this ado.
97109,97110,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.1.106,AARON,"Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools"
97110,97111,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.1.107,AARON,"To square for this? would it offend you, then"
97111,97112,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.1.108,AARON,That both should speed?
97112,97113,Titus Andronicus,24.0,2.1.109,CHIRON,"Faith, not me."
97113,97114,Titus Andronicus,25.0,2.1.110,DEMETRIUS,"Nor me, so I were one."
97114,97115,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.111,AARON,"For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:"
97115,97116,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.112,AARON,'Tis policy and stratagem must do
97116,97117,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.113,AARON,"That you affect, and so must you resolve,"
97117,97118,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.114,AARON,"That what you cannot as you would achieve,"
97118,97119,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.115,AARON,You must perforce accomplish as you may.
97119,97120,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.116,AARON,Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
97120,97121,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.117,AARON,"Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love."
97121,97122,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.118,AARON,A speedier course than lingering languishment
97122,97123,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.119,AARON,"Must we pursue, and I have found the path."
97123,97124,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.120,AARON,"My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand,"
97124,97125,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.121,AARON,There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:

97126,97127,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.123,AARON,And many unfrequented plots there are
97127,97128,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.124,AARON,Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
97128,97129,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.125,AARON,"Single you thither then this dainty doe,"
97129,97130,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.126,AARON,"And strike her home by force, if not by words:"
97130,97131,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.127,AARON,"This way, or not at all, stand you in hope."
97131,97132,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.1.128,AARON,"Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit"

97154,97155,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.2.4,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
97155,97156,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.2.5,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,"
97156,97157,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.2.6,TITUS ANDRONICUS,That all the court may echo with the noise.

97158,97159,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.2.8,TITUS ANDRONICUS,To attend the emperor's person carefully:

97160,97161,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.2.10,TITUS ANDRONICUS,But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.

97165,97166,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.2.14,SATURNINUS,"And you have rung it lustily, my lord,"
97166,97167,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.2.15,SATURNINUS,Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.

97187,97188,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.3.3,AARON,And never after to inherit it.
97188,97189,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.3.4,AARON,Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
97189,97190,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.3.5,AARON,"Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,"
97190,97191,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.3.6,AARON,"Which, cunningly effected, will beget"
97191,97192,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.3.7,AARON,A very excellent piece of villany:
97192,97193,Titus Andronicus,1.0,2.3.8,AARON,"And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest"

97199,97200,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.13,TAMORA,"The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,"
97200,97201,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.14,TAMORA,The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
97201,97202,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.15,TAMORA,And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:
97202,97203,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.16,TAMORA,"Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,"
97203,97204,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.17,TAMORA,"And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,"
97204,97205,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.18,TAMORA,"Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,"
97205,97206,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.19,TAMORA,"As if a double hunt were heard at once,"
97206,97207,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.20,TAMORA,"Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise,"
97207,97208,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.21,TAMORA,"And, after conflict such as was supposed"
97208,97209,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.22,TAMORA,"The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,"
97209,97210,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.23,TAMORA,When with a happy storm they were surprised
97210,97211,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.24,TAMORA,"And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,"
97211,97212,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.25,TAMORA,"We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,"
97212,97213,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.26,TAMORA,"Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,"
97213,97214,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.27,TAMORA,Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
97214,97215,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.28,TAMORA,Be unto us as is a nurse's song
97215,97216,Titus Andronicus,2.0,2.3.29,TAMORA,Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
97216,97217,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.30,AARON,"Madam, though Venus govern your desires,"
97217,97218,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.31,AARON,Saturn is dominator over mine:

97220,97221,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.34,AARON,My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
97221,97222,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.35,AARON,Even as an adder when she doth unroll
97222,97223,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.36,AARON,To do some fatal execution?
97223,97224,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.37,AARON,"No, madam, these are no venereal signs:"
97224,97225,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.38,AARON,"Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,"
97225,97226,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.39,AARON,Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
97226,97227,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.40,AARON,"Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,"
97227,97228,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.41,AARON,"Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,"
97228,97229,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.42,AARON,This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
97229,97230,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.43,AARON,"His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,"
97230,97231,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.44,AARON,Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
97231,97232,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.45,AARON,And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
97232,97233,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.46,AARON,"Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,"
97233,97234,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.47,AARON,And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
97234,97235,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.48,AARON,"Now question me no more, we are espied,"
97235,97236,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.49,AARON,"Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,"
97236,97237,Titus Andronicus,3.0,2.3.50,AARON,Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
97237,97238,Titus Andronicus,4.0,2.3.51,TAMORA,"Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!"
97238,97239,Titus Andronicus,5.0,2.3.52,AARON,"No more, great empress, Bassianus comes:"

97244,97245,Titus Andronicus,6.0,2.3.56,BASSIANUS,Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
97245,97246,Titus Andronicus,6.0,2.3.57,BASSIANUS,"Or is it Dian, habited like her,"
97246,97247,Titus Andronicus,6.0,2.3.58,BASSIANUS,Who hath abandoned her holy groves
97247,97248,Titus Andronicus,6.0,2.3.59,BASSIANUS,To see the general hunting in this forest?
97248,97249,Titus Andronicus,7.0,2.3.60,TAMORA,Saucy controller of our private steps!
97249,97250,Titus Andronicus,7.0,2.3.61,TAMORA,"Had I the power that some say Dian had,"
97250,97251,Titus Andronicus,7.0,2.3.62,TAMORA,Thy temples should be planted presently
97251,97252,Titus Andronicus,7.0,2.3.63,TAMORA,"With horns, as was Actaeon's, and the hounds"
97252,97253,Titus Andronicus,7.0,2.3.64,TAMORA,"Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,"
97253,97254,Titus Andronicus,7.0,2.3.65,TAMORA,Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
97254,97255,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.3.66,LAVINIA,"Under your patience, gentle empress,"
97255,97256,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.3.67,LAVINIA,"'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,"
97256,97257,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.3.68,LAVINIA,And to be doubted that your Moor and you
97257,97258,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.3.69,LAVINIA,Are singled forth to try experiments:
97258,97259,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.3.70,LAVINIA,Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
97259,97260,Titus Andronicus,8.0,2.3.71,LAVINIA,'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
97260,97261,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.72,BASSIANUS,"Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian"
97261,97262,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.73,BASSIANUS,"Doth make your honour of his body's hue,"
97262,97263,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.74,BASSIANUS,"Spotted, detested, and abominable."
97263,97264,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.75,BASSIANUS,"Why are you sequester'd from all your train,"
97264,97265,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.76,BASSIANUS,Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
97265,97266,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.77,BASSIANUS,"And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,"
97266,97267,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.78,BASSIANUS,"Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,"
97267,97268,Titus Andronicus,9.0,2.3.79,BASSIANUS,If foul desire had not conducted you?
97268,97269,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.3.80,LAVINIA,"And, being intercepted in your sport,"
97269,97270,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.3.81,LAVINIA,Great reason that my noble lord be rated
97270,97271,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.3.82,LAVINIA,"For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,"
97271,97272,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.3.83,LAVINIA,"And let her joy her raven-colour'd love,"
97272,97273,Titus Andronicus,10.0,2.3.84,LAVINIA,This valley fits the purpose passing well.
97273,97274,Titus Andronicus,11.0,2.3.85,BASSIANUS,The king my brother shall have note of this.
97274,97275,Titus Andronicus,12.0,2.3.86,LAVINIA,"Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:"
97275,97276,Titus Andronicus,12.0,2.3.87,LAVINIA,"Good king, to be so mightily abused!"
97276,97277,Titus Andronicus,13.0,2.3.88,TAMORA,Why have I patience to endure all this?
97277,97278,Titus Andronicus,13.0,,TAMORA,Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
97278,97279,Titus Andronicus,14.0,2.3.89,DEMETRIUS,"How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!"
97279,97280,Titus Andronicus,14.0,2.3.90,DEMETRIUS,Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
97280,97281,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.91,TAMORA,"Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?"
97281,97282,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.92,TAMORA,These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
97282,97283,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.93,TAMORA,"A barren detested vale, you see it is,"
97283,97284,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.94,TAMORA,"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,"
97284,97285,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.95,TAMORA,O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
97285,97286,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.96,TAMORA,"Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds,"
97286,97287,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.97,TAMORA,Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
97287,97288,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.98,TAMORA,"And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,"
97288,97289,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.99,TAMORA,"They told me, here, at dead time of the night,"
97289,97290,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.100,TAMORA,"A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,"
97290,97291,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.101,TAMORA,"Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,"
97291,97292,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.102,TAMORA,Would make such fearful and confused cries
97292,97293,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.103,TAMORA,As any mortal body hearing it
97293,97294,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.104,TAMORA,"Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly."
97294,97295,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.105,TAMORA,"No sooner had they told this hellish tale,"
97295,97296,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.106,TAMORA,But straight they told me they would bind me here
97296,97297,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.107,TAMORA,"Unto the body of a dismal yew,"
97297,97298,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.108,TAMORA,And leave me to this miserable death:
97298,97299,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.109,TAMORA,"And then they call'd me foul adulteress,"
97299,97300,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.110,TAMORA,"Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms"
97300,97301,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.111,TAMORA,That ever ear did hear to such effect:
97301,97302,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.112,TAMORA,"And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,"
97302,97303,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.113,TAMORA,This vengeance on me had they executed.
97303,97304,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.114,TAMORA,"Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,"
97304,97305,Titus Andronicus,15.0,2.3.115,TAMORA,Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
97305,97306,Titus Andronicus,16.0,2.3.116,DEMETRIUS,This is a witness that I am thy son.
97306,97307,Titus Andronicus,16.0,,DEMETRIUS,Stabs BASSIANUS
97307,97308,Titus Andronicus,17.0,2.3.117,CHIRON,"And this for me, struck home to show my strength."
97308,97309,Titus Andronicus,17.0,,CHIRON,"Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies"
97309,97310,Titus Andronicus,18.0,2.3.118,LAVINIA,"Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,"
97310,97311,Titus Andronicus,18.0,2.3.119,LAVINIA,For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
97311,97312,Titus Andronicus,19.0,2.3.120,TAMORA,"Give me thy poniard, you shall know, my boys"
97312,97313,Titus Andronicus,19.0,2.3.121,TAMORA,Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
97313,97314,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.3.122,DEMETRIUS,"Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her,"
97314,97315,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.3.123,DEMETRIUS,"First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:"
97315,97316,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.3.124,DEMETRIUS,"This minion stood upon her chastity,"
97316,97317,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.3.125,DEMETRIUS,"Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,"
97317,97318,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.3.126,DEMETRIUS,And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
97318,97319,Titus Andronicus,20.0,2.3.127,DEMETRIUS,And shall she carry this unto her grave?
97319,97320,Titus Andronicus,21.0,2.3.128,CHIRON,"An if she do, I would I were an eunuch."
97320,97321,Titus Andronicus,21.0,2.3.129,CHIRON,"Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,"
97321,97322,Titus Andronicus,21.0,2.3.130,CHIRON,And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
97322,97323,Titus Andronicus,22.0,2.3.131,TAMORA,"But when ye have the honey ye desire,"
97323,97324,Titus Andronicus,22.0,2.3.132,TAMORA,"Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting."
97324,97325,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.3.133,CHIRON,"I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure."
97325,97326,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.3.134,CHIRON,"Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy"
97326,97327,Titus Andronicus,23.0,2.3.135,CHIRON,That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
97327,97328,Titus Andronicus,24.0,2.3.136,LAVINIA,"O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--"
97328,97329,Titus Andronicus,25.0,2.3.137,TAMORA,"I will not hear her speak, away with her!"
97329,97330,Titus Andronicus,26.0,2.3.138,LAVINIA,"Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word."
97330,97331,Titus Andronicus,27.0,2.3.139,DEMETRIUS,"Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory"
97331,97332,Titus Andronicus,27.0,2.3.140,DEMETRIUS,"To see her tears, but be your heart to them"
97332,97333,Titus Andronicus,27.0,2.3.141,DEMETRIUS,As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
97333,97334,Titus Andronicus,28.0,2.3.142,LAVINIA,When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
97334,97335,Titus Andronicus,28.0,2.3.143,LAVINIA,"O, do not learn her wrath, she taught it thee,"
97335,97336,Titus Andronicus,28.0,2.3.144,LAVINIA,"The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble,"
97336,97337,Titus Andronicus,28.0,2.3.145,LAVINIA,Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
97337,97338,Titus Andronicus,28.0,2.3.146,LAVINIA,Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
97338,97339,Titus Andronicus,28.0,,LAVINIA,To CHIRON
97339,97340,Titus Andronicus,28.0,2.3.147,LAVINIA,Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
97340,97341,Titus Andronicus,29.0,2.3.148,CHIRON,"What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?"
97341,97342,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.149,LAVINIA,"'Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark:"
97342,97343,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.150,LAVINIA,"Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--"
97343,97344,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.151,LAVINIA,The lion moved with pity did endure
97344,97345,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.152,LAVINIA,To have his princely paws pared all away:
97345,97346,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.153,LAVINIA,"Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,"
97346,97347,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.154,LAVINIA,The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
97347,97348,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.155,LAVINIA,"O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,"
97348,97349,Titus Andronicus,30.0,2.3.156,LAVINIA,"Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!"
97349,97350,Titus Andronicus,31.0,2.3.157,TAMORA,"I know not what it means, away with her!"
97350,97351,Titus Andronicus,32.0,2.3.158,LAVINIA,"O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,"
97351,97352,Titus Andronicus,32.0,2.3.159,LAVINIA,"That gave thee life, when well he might have"
97352,97353,Titus Andronicus,32.0,2.3.160,LAVINIA,"slain thee,"
97353,97354,Titus Andronicus,32.0,2.3.161,LAVINIA,"Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears."
97354,97355,Titus Andronicus,33.0,2.3.162,TAMORA,"Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,"
97355,97356,Titus Andronicus,33.0,2.3.163,TAMORA,Even for his sake am I pitiless.
97356,97357,Titus Andronicus,33.0,2.3.164,TAMORA,"Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,"
97357,97358,Titus Andronicus,33.0,2.3.165,TAMORA,"To save your brother from the sacrifice,"
97358,97359,Titus Andronicus,33.0,2.3.166,TAMORA,"But fierce Andronicus would not relent,"
97359,97360,Titus Andronicus,33.0,2.3.167,TAMORA,"Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,"
97360,97361,Titus Andronicus,33.0,2.3.168,TAMORA,"The worse to her, the better loved of me."
97361,97362,Titus Andronicus,34.0,2.3.169,LAVINIA,"O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,"
97362,97363,Titus Andronicus,34.0,2.3.170,LAVINIA,And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
97363,97364,Titus Andronicus,34.0,2.3.171,LAVINIA,"For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long,"
97364,97365,Titus Andronicus,34.0,2.3.172,LAVINIA,Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
97365,97366,Titus Andronicus,35.0,2.3.173,TAMORA,"What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go."
97366,97367,Titus Andronicus,36.0,2.3.174,LAVINIA,"'Tis present death I beg, and one thing more"
97367,97368,Titus Andronicus,36.0,2.3.175,LAVINIA,That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
97368,97369,Titus Andronicus,36.0,2.3.176,LAVINIA,"O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,"
97369,97370,Titus Andronicus,36.0,2.3.177,LAVINIA,"And tumble me into some loathsome pit,"
97370,97371,Titus Andronicus,36.0,2.3.178,LAVINIA,Where never man's eye may behold my body:
97371,97372,Titus Andronicus,36.0,2.3.179,LAVINIA,"Do this, and be a charitable murderer."
97372,97373,Titus Andronicus,37.0,2.3.180,TAMORA,So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
97373,97374,Titus Andronicus,37.0,2.3.181,TAMORA,"No, let them satisfy their lust on thee."
97374,97375,Titus Andronicus,38.0,2.3.182,DEMETRIUS,Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
97375,97376,Titus Andronicus,39.0,2.3.183,LAVINIA,"No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!"
97376,97377,Titus Andronicus,39.0,2.3.184,LAVINIA,The blot and enemy to our general name!
97377,97378,Titus Andronicus,39.0,2.3.185,LAVINIA,Confusion fall--
97378,97379,Titus Andronicus,40.0,2.3.186,CHIRON,"Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:"
97379,97380,Titus Andronicus,40.0,2.3.187,CHIRON,This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
97380,97381,Titus Andronicus,40.0,2.3.187,CHIRON,"DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the  pit, then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging off LAVINIA"
97381,97382,Titus Andronicus,41.0,2.3.188,TAMORA,"Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure."
97382,97383,Titus Andronicus,41.0,2.3.189,TAMORA,"Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,"
97383,97384,Titus Andronicus,41.0,2.3.190,TAMORA,Till all the Andronici be made away.
97384,97385,Titus Andronicus,41.0,2.3.191,TAMORA,"Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,"
97385,97386,Titus Andronicus,41.0,2.3.192,TAMORA,And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.
97386,97387,Titus Andronicus,41.0,,TAMORA,Exit
97387,97388,Titus Andronicus,41.0,,TAMORA,"Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS"
97388,97389,Titus Andronicus,42.0,2.3.193,AARON,"Come on, my lords, the better foot before:"
97389,97390,Titus Andronicus,42.0,2.3.194,AARON,Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
97390,97391,Titus Andronicus,42.0,2.3.195,AARON,Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
97391,97392,Titus Andronicus,43.0,2.3.196,QUINTUS,"My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes."
97392,97393,Titus Andronicus,44.0,2.3.197,MARTIUS,"And mine, I promise you, were't not for shame,"
97393,97394,Titus Andronicus,44.0,2.3.198,MARTIUS,Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
97394,97395,Titus Andronicus,44.0,,MARTIUS,Falls into the pit
97395,97396,Titus Andronicus,45.0,2.3.199,QUINTUS,"What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,"
97396,97397,Titus Andronicus,45.0,2.3.200,QUINTUS,"Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,"
97397,97398,Titus Andronicus,45.0,2.3.201,QUINTUS,Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
97398,97399,Titus Andronicus,45.0,2.3.202,QUINTUS,As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
97399,97400,Titus Andronicus,45.0,2.3.203,QUINTUS,A very fatal place it seems to me.
97400,97401,Titus Andronicus,45.0,2.3.204,QUINTUS,"Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?"
97401,97402,Titus Andronicus,46.0,2.3.205,MARTIUS,"O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt"
97402,97403,Titus Andronicus,46.0,2.3.206,MARTIUS,That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
97403,97404,Titus Andronicus,47.0,2.3.207,AARON,"[Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,"
97404,97405,Titus Andronicus,47.0,2.3.208,AARON,That he thereby may give a likely guess
97405,97406,Titus Andronicus,47.0,2.3.209,AARON,How these were they that made away his brother.
97406,97407,Titus Andronicus,47.0,,AARON,Exit
97407,97408,Titus Andronicus,48.0,2.3.210,MARTIUS,"Why dost not comfort me, and help me out"
97408,97409,Titus Andronicus,48.0,2.3.211,MARTIUS,From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
97409,97410,Titus Andronicus,49.0,2.3.212,QUINTUS,"I am surprised with an uncouth fear,"
97410,97411,Titus Andronicus,49.0,2.3.213,QUINTUS,A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:
97411,97412,Titus Andronicus,49.0,2.3.214,QUINTUS,My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
97412,97413,Titus Andronicus,50.0,2.3.215,MARTIUS,"To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,"
97413,97414,Titus Andronicus,50.0,2.3.216,MARTIUS,"Aaron and thou look down into this den,"
97414,97415,Titus Andronicus,50.0,2.3.217,MARTIUS,And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
97415,97416,Titus Andronicus,51.0,2.3.218,QUINTUS,"Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart"
97416,97417,Titus Andronicus,51.0,2.3.219,QUINTUS,Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
97417,97418,Titus Andronicus,51.0,2.3.220,QUINTUS,"The thing whereat it trembles by surmise,"
97418,97419,Titus Andronicus,51.0,2.3.221,QUINTUS,"O, tell me how it is, for ne'er till now"
97419,97420,Titus Andronicus,51.0,2.3.222,QUINTUS,Was I a child to fear I know not what.
97420,97421,Titus Andronicus,52.0,2.3.223,MARTIUS,"Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,"
97421,97422,Titus Andronicus,52.0,2.3.224,MARTIUS,"All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,"
97422,97423,Titus Andronicus,52.0,2.3.225,MARTIUS,"In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit."
97423,97424,Titus Andronicus,53.0,2.3.226,QUINTUS,"If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?"
97424,97425,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.227,MARTIUS,Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
97425,97426,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.228,MARTIUS,"A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,"
97426,97427,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.229,MARTIUS,"Which, like a taper in some monument,"
97427,97428,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.230,MARTIUS,"Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,"
97428,97429,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.231,MARTIUS,And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
97429,97430,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.232,MARTIUS,So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
97430,97431,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.233,MARTIUS,When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
97431,97432,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.234,MARTIUS,"O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--"
97432,97433,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.235,MARTIUS,"If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--"
97433,97434,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.236,MARTIUS,"Out of this fell devouring receptacle,"
97434,97435,Titus Andronicus,54.0,2.3.237,MARTIUS,As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
97435,97436,Titus Andronicus,55.0,2.3.238,QUINTUS,"Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,"
97436,97437,Titus Andronicus,55.0,2.3.239,QUINTUS,"Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,"
97437,97438,Titus Andronicus,55.0,2.3.240,QUINTUS,I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
97438,97439,Titus Andronicus,55.0,2.3.241,QUINTUS,"Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave."
97439,97440,Titus Andronicus,55.0,2.3.242,QUINTUS,I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
97440,97441,Titus Andronicus,56.0,2.3.243,MARTIUS,Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
97441,97442,Titus Andronicus,57.0,2.3.244,QUINTUS,"Thy hand once more, I will not loose again,"
97442,97443,Titus Andronicus,57.0,2.3.245,QUINTUS,"Till thou art here aloft, or I below:"
97443,97444,Titus Andronicus,57.0,2.3.246,QUINTUS,Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
97444,97445,Titus Andronicus,57.0,,QUINTUS,Falls in
97445,97446,Titus Andronicus,57.0,,QUINTUS,Enter SATURNINUS with AARON
97446,97447,Titus Andronicus,58.0,2.3.247,SATURNINUS,"Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,"
97447,97448,Titus Andronicus,58.0,2.3.248,SATURNINUS,And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
97448,97449,Titus Andronicus,58.0,2.3.249,SATURNINUS,Say who art thou that lately didst descend
97449,97450,Titus Andronicus,58.0,2.3.250,SATURNINUS,Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
97450,97451,Titus Andronicus,59.0,2.3.251,MARTIUS,The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
97451,97452,Titus Andronicus,59.0,2.3.252,MARTIUS,"Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,"
97452,97453,Titus Andronicus,59.0,2.3.253,MARTIUS,To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
97453,97454,Titus Andronicus,60.0,2.3.254,SATURNINUS,My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
97454,97455,Titus Andronicus,60.0,2.3.255,SATURNINUS,He and his lady both are at the lodge
97455,97456,Titus Andronicus,60.0,2.3.256,SATURNINUS,"Upon the north side of this pleasant chase,"
97456,97457,Titus Andronicus,60.0,2.3.257,SATURNINUS,'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
97457,97458,Titus Andronicus,61.0,2.3.258,MARTIUS,"We know not where you left him all alive,"
97458,97459,Titus Andronicus,61.0,2.3.259,MARTIUS,"But, out, alas! here have we found him dead."
97459,97460,Titus Andronicus,61.0,2.3.259,MARTIUS,"Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants, TITUS ANDRONICUS, and Lucius"
97460,97461,Titus Andronicus,62.0,2.3.260,TAMORA,Where is my lord the king?
97461,97462,Titus Andronicus,63.0,2.3.261,SATURNINUS,"Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief."
97462,97463,Titus Andronicus,64.0,2.3.262,TAMORA,Where is thy brother Bassianus?
97463,97464,Titus Andronicus,65.0,2.3.263,SATURNINUS,Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
97464,97465,Titus Andronicus,65.0,2.3.264,SATURNINUS,Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
97465,97466,Titus Andronicus,66.0,2.3.265,TAMORA,"Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,"
97466,97467,Titus Andronicus,66.0,2.3.266,TAMORA,"The complot of this timeless tragedy,"
97467,97468,Titus Andronicus,66.0,2.3.267,TAMORA,And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
97468,97469,Titus Andronicus,66.0,2.3.268,TAMORA,In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
97469,97470,Titus Andronicus,66.0,,TAMORA,She giveth SATURNINUS a letter

97641,97642,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.1.62,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,This was thy daughter.

97643,97644,Titus Andronicus,12.0,3.1.64,LUCIUS,"Ay me, this object kills me!"
97644,97645,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.65,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her."
97645,97646,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.66,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand"

97647,97648,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.68,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What fool hath added water to the sea,"
97648,97649,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.69,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
97649,97650,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.70,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"My grief was at the height before thou camest,"
97650,97651,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.71,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds."
97651,97652,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.72,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too,"
97652,97653,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.73,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain,"
97653,97654,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.74,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life,"
97654,97655,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.75,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"In bootless prayer have they been held up,"
97655,97656,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.76,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And they have served me to effectless use:
97656,97657,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.77,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Now all the service I require of them
97657,97658,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.78,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Is that the one will help to cut the other.
97658,97659,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.79,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,"
97659,97660,Titus Andronicus,13.0,3.1.80,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain."
97660,97661,Titus Andronicus,14.0,3.1.81,LUCIUS,"Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?"
97661,97662,Titus Andronicus,15.0,3.1.82,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, that delightful engine of her thoughts"
97662,97663,Titus Andronicus,15.0,3.1.83,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,"
97663,97664,Titus Andronicus,15.0,3.1.84,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,"
97664,97665,Titus Andronicus,15.0,3.1.85,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung"
97665,97666,Titus Andronicus,15.0,3.1.86,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!"
97666,97667,Titus Andronicus,16.0,3.1.87,LUCIUS,"O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?"
97667,97668,Titus Andronicus,17.0,3.1.88,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, thus I found her, straying in the park,"
97668,97669,Titus Andronicus,17.0,3.1.89,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer"
97669,97670,Titus Andronicus,17.0,3.1.90,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,That hath received some unrecuring wound.
97670,97671,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.91,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"It was my deer, and he that wounded her"
97671,97672,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.92,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
97672,97673,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.93,TITUS ANDRONICUS,For now I stand as one upon a rock
97673,97674,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.94,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Environed with a wilderness of sea,"
97674,97675,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.95,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,"
97675,97676,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.96,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Expecting ever when some envious surge
97676,97677,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.97,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
97677,97678,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.98,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This way to death my wretched sons are gone,"
97678,97679,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.99,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here stands my other son, a banished man,"
97679,97680,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.100,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And here my brother, weeping at my woes."
97680,97681,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.101,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,"
97681,97682,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.102,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul."
97682,97683,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.103,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,"
97683,97684,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.104,TITUS ANDRONICUS,It would have madded me: what shall I do
97684,97685,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.105,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Now I behold thy lively body so?
97685,97686,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.106,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:"
97686,97687,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.107,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:"
97687,97688,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.108,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
97688,97689,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.109,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this."
97689,97690,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.110,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!"
97690,97691,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.111,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears"
97691,97692,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.112,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew"
97692,97693,Titus Andronicus,18.0,3.1.113,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
97693,97694,Titus Andronicus,19.0,3.1.114,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband,"
97694,97695,Titus Andronicus,19.0,3.1.115,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Perchance because she knows them innocent.
97695,97696,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.116,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful"
97696,97697,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.117,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
97697,97698,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.118,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No, no, they would not do so foul a deed,"
97698,97699,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.119,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
97699,97700,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.120,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips."
97700,97701,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.121,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
97701,97702,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.122,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,"
97702,97703,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.123,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,"
97703,97704,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.124,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
97704,97705,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.125,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,"
97705,97706,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.126,TITUS ANDRONICUS,With miry slime left on them by a flood?
97706,97707,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.127,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
97707,97708,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.128,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,"
97708,97709,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.129,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
97709,97710,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.130,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?"
97710,97711,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.131,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows"
97711,97712,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.132,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
97712,97713,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.133,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,"
97713,97714,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.134,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Plot some deuce of further misery,"
97714,97715,Titus Andronicus,20.0,3.1.135,TITUS ANDRONICUS,To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
97715,97716,Titus Andronicus,21.0,3.1.136,LUCIUS,"Sweet father, cease your tears, for, at your grief,"
97716,97717,Titus Andronicus,21.0,3.1.137,LUCIUS,See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
97717,97718,Titus Andronicus,22.0,3.1.138,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes."
97718,97719,Titus Andronicus,23.0,3.1.139,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot"
97719,97720,Titus Andronicus,23.0,3.1.140,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,"
97720,97721,Titus Andronicus,23.0,3.1.141,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own."
97721,97722,Titus Andronicus,24.0,3.1.142,LUCIUS,"Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks."
97722,97723,Titus Andronicus,25.0,3.1.143,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:"
97723,97724,Titus Andronicus,25.0,3.1.144,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say"
97724,97725,Titus Andronicus,25.0,3.1.145,TITUS ANDRONICUS,That to her brother which I said to thee:
97725,97726,Titus Andronicus,25.0,3.1.146,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,"
97726,97727,Titus Andronicus,25.0,3.1.147,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
97727,97728,Titus Andronicus,25.0,3.1.148,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, what a sympathy of woe is this,"
97728,97729,Titus Andronicus,25.0,3.1.149,TITUS ANDRONICUS,As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
97729,97730,Titus Andronicus,25.0,,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Enter AARON
97730,97731,Titus Andronicus,26.0,3.1.150,AARON,"Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor"
97731,97732,Titus Andronicus,26.0,3.1.151,AARON,"Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,"
97732,97733,Titus Andronicus,26.0,3.1.152,AARON,"Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,"
97733,97734,Titus Andronicus,26.0,3.1.153,AARON,"Or any one of you, chop off your hand,"
97734,97735,Titus Andronicus,26.0,3.1.154,AARON,And send it to the king: he for the same
97735,97736,Titus Andronicus,26.0,3.1.155,AARON,"Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,"
97736,97737,Titus Andronicus,26.0,3.1.156,AARON,And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
97737,97738,Titus Andronicus,27.0,3.1.157,TITUS ANDRONICUS,O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
97738,97739,Titus Andronicus,27.0,3.1.158,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Did ever raven sing so like a lark,"
97739,97740,Titus Andronicus,27.0,3.1.159,TITUS ANDRONICUS,That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
97740,97741,Titus Andronicus,27.0,3.1.160,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:"
97741,97742,Titus Andronicus,27.0,3.1.161,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?"
97742,97743,Titus Andronicus,28.0,3.1.162,LUCIUS,"Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,"
97743,97744,Titus Andronicus,28.0,3.1.163,LUCIUS,"That hath thrown down so many enemies,"
97744,97745,Titus Andronicus,28.0,3.1.164,LUCIUS,Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
97745,97746,Titus Andronicus,28.0,3.1.165,LUCIUS,"My youth can better spare my blood than you,"
97746,97747,Titus Andronicus,28.0,3.1.166,LUCIUS,And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
97747,97748,Titus Andronicus,29.0,3.1.167,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,"
97748,97749,Titus Andronicus,29.0,3.1.168,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,"
97749,97750,Titus Andronicus,29.0,3.1.169,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
97750,97751,Titus Andronicus,29.0,3.1.170,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, none of both but are of high desert:"
97751,97752,Titus Andronicus,29.0,3.1.171,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My hand hath been but idle, let it serve"
97752,97753,Titus Andronicus,29.0,3.1.172,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To ransom my two nephews from their death,"
97753,97754,Titus Andronicus,29.0,3.1.173,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
97754,97755,Titus Andronicus,30.0,3.1.174,AARON,"Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,"
97755,97756,Titus Andronicus,30.0,3.1.175,AARON,For fear they die before their pardon come.
97756,97757,Titus Andronicus,31.0,3.1.176,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,My hand shall go.
97757,97758,Titus Andronicus,32.0,3.1.177,LUCIUS,"By heaven, it shall not go!"
97758,97759,Titus Andronicus,33.0,3.1.178,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these"
97759,97760,Titus Andronicus,33.0,3.1.179,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine."
97760,97761,Titus Andronicus,34.0,3.1.180,LUCIUS,"Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,"
97761,97762,Titus Andronicus,34.0,3.1.181,LUCIUS,Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
97762,97763,Titus Andronicus,35.0,3.1.182,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And, for our father's sake and mother's care,"
97763,97764,Titus Andronicus,35.0,3.1.183,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
97764,97765,Titus Andronicus,36.0,3.1.184,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Agree between you, I will spare my hand."
97765,97766,Titus Andronicus,37.0,3.1.185,LUCIUS,Then I'll go fetch an axe.
97766,97767,Titus Andronicus,38.0,3.1.186,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,But I will use the axe.
97767,97768,Titus Andronicus,38.0,,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS
97768,97769,Titus Andronicus,39.0,3.1.187,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come hither, Aaron, I'll deceive them both:"
97769,97770,Titus Andronicus,39.0,3.1.188,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine."
97770,97771,Titus Andronicus,40.0,3.1.189,AARON,"[Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,"
97771,97772,Titus Andronicus,40.0,3.1.190,AARON,"And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:"
97772,97773,Titus Andronicus,40.0,3.1.191,AARON,"But I'll deceive you in another sort,"
97773,97774,Titus Andronicus,40.0,3.1.192,AARON,"And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass."

97777,97778,Titus Andronicus,41.0,3.1.194,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:"
97778,97779,Titus Andronicus,41.0,3.1.195,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Tell him it was a hand that warded him
97779,97780,Titus Andronicus,41.0,3.1.196,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"From thousand dangers, bid him bury it"

97782,97783,Titus Andronicus,41.0,3.1.199,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As jewels purchased at an easy price,"
97783,97784,Titus Andronicus,41.0,3.1.200,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And yet dear too, because I bought mine own."
97784,97785,Titus Andronicus,42.0,3.1.201,AARON,"I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand"
97785,97786,Titus Andronicus,42.0,3.1.202,AARON,Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.

97790,97791,Titus Andronicus,42.0,3.1.206,AARON,Aaron will have his soul black like his face.

97794,97795,Titus Andronicus,43.0,3.1.209,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"If any power pities wretched tears,"
97795,97796,Titus Andronicus,43.0,3.1.210,TITUS ANDRONICUS,To that I call!

97808,97809,Titus Andronicus,47.0,3.1.222,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Then into limits could I bind my woes:

97811,97812,Titus Andronicus,47.0,3.1.225,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
97812,97813,Titus Andronicus,47.0,3.1.226,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
97813,97814,Titus Andronicus,47.0,3.1.227,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I am the sea, hark, how her sighs do blow!"

97821,97822,Titus Andronicus,47.0,3.1.235,TITUS ANDRONICUS,To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

97829,97830,Titus Andronicus,48.0,3.1.242,Messenger,More than remembrance of my father's death.

97832,97833,Titus Andronicus,49.0,3.1.244,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
97833,97834,Titus Andronicus,49.0,3.1.245,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,These miseries are more than may be borne.
97834,97835,Titus Andronicus,49.0,3.1.246,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,"
97835,97836,Titus Andronicus,49.0,3.1.247,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,But sorrow flouted at is double death.

97858,97859,Titus Andronicus,56.0,3.1.269,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,"
97859,97860,Titus Andronicus,56.0,3.1.270,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And would usurp upon my watery eyes
97860,97861,Titus Andronicus,56.0,3.1.271,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And make them blind with tributary tears:
97861,97862,Titus Andronicus,56.0,3.1.272,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
97862,97863,Titus Andronicus,56.0,3.1.273,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"For these two heads do seem to speak to me,"
97863,97864,Titus Andronicus,56.0,3.1.274,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And threat me I shall never come to bliss

97887,97888,Titus Andronicus,57.0,3.1.297,LUCIUS,But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
97888,97889,Titus Andronicus,57.0,3.1.298,LUCIUS,"If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs,"
97889,97890,Titus Andronicus,57.0,3.1.299,LUCIUS,And make proud Saturnine and his empress
97890,97891,Titus Andronicus,57.0,3.1.300,LUCIUS,"Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen."
97891,97892,Titus Andronicus,57.0,3.1.301,LUCIUS,"Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,"
97892,97893,Titus Andronicus,57.0,3.1.302,LUCIUS,To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.

97897,97898,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.2,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Than will preserve just so much strength in us
97898,97899,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.3,TITUS ANDRONICUS,As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
97899,97900,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.4,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:"
97900,97901,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.5,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,"
97901,97902,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.6,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And cannot passionate our tenfold grief

97912,97913,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.16,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or get some little knife between thy teeth,"
97913,97914,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.17,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And just against thy heart make thou a hole,"
97914,97915,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.18,TITUS ANDRONICUS,That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
97915,97916,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.19,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"May run into that sink, and soaking in"
97916,97917,Titus Andronicus,1.0,3.2.20,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.

97918,97919,Titus Andronicus,2.0,3.2.22,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Such violent hands upon her tender life.

97920,97921,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.24,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I."
97921,97922,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.25,TITUS ANDRONICUS,What violent hands can she lay on her life?
97922,97923,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.26,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,"
97923,97924,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.27,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,"
97924,97925,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.28,TITUS ANDRONICUS,How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
97925,97926,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.29,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,"
97926,97927,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.30,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Lest we remember still that we have none.

97928,97929,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.32,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"As if we should forget we had no hands,"
97929,97930,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.33,TITUS ANDRONICUS,If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
97930,97931,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.34,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, let's fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this:"
97931,97932,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.35,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says,"
97932,97933,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.36,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I can interpret all her martyr'd signs,"
97933,97934,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.37,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"She says she drinks no other drink but tears,"
97934,97935,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.38,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:"

97936,97937,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.40,TITUS ANDRONICUS,In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
97937,97938,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.41,TITUS ANDRONICUS,As begging hermits in their holy prayers:

97939,97940,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.43,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,"
97940,97941,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.44,TITUS ANDRONICUS,But I of these will wrest an alphabet
97941,97942,Titus Andronicus,3.0,3.2.45,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.
97942,97943,Titus Andronicus,4.0,3.2.46,Young LUCIUS,"Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:"

97947,97948,Titus Andronicus,6.0,3.2.51,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And tears will quickly melt thy life away.

97951,97952,Titus Andronicus,8.0,3.2.54,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart,"
97952,97953,Titus Andronicus,8.0,3.2.55,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:
97953,97954,Titus Andronicus,8.0,3.2.56,TITUS ANDRONICUS,A deed of death done on the innocent

97955,97956,Titus Andronicus,8.0,3.2.58,TITUS ANDRONICUS,I see thou art not for my company.

97957,97958,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.2.60,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But how, if that fly had a father and mother?"
97958,97959,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.2.61,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How would he hang his slender gilded wings,"
97959,97960,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.2.62,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
97960,97961,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.2.63,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Poor harmless fly,"
97961,97962,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.2.64,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That, with his pretty buzzing melody,"
97962,97963,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.2.65,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
97963,97964,Titus Andronicus,10.0,3.2.66,TITUS ANDRONICUS,kill'd him.

97965,97966,Titus Andronicus,11.0,3.2.68,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Like to the empress' Moor, therefore I kill'd him."

97967,97968,Titus Andronicus,12.0,3.2.70,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Then pardon me for reprehending thee,"
97968,97969,Titus Andronicus,12.0,3.2.71,TITUS ANDRONICUS,For thou hast done a charitable deed.

97987,97988,Titus Andronicus,14.0,,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,  and the boy flies from her, with books under his arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS"
97988,97989,Titus Andronicus,1.0,4.1.1,Young LUCIUS,"Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia"
97989,97990,Titus Andronicus,1.0,4.1.2,Young LUCIUS,"Follows me every where, I know not why:"
97990,97991,Titus Andronicus,1.0,4.1.3,Young LUCIUS,"Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes."
97991,97992,Titus Andronicus,1.0,4.1.4,Young LUCIUS,"Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean."
97992,97993,Titus Andronicus,2.0,4.1.5,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Stand by me, Lucius, do not fear thine aunt."
97993,97994,Titus Andronicus,3.0,4.1.6,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm."
97994,97995,Titus Andronicus,4.0,4.1.7,Young LUCIUS,"Ay, when my father was in Rome she did."
97995,97996,Titus Andronicus,5.0,4.1.8,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
97996,97997,Titus Andronicus,6.0,4.1.9,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:"
97997,97998,Titus Andronicus,6.0,4.1.10,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:"
97998,97999,Titus Andronicus,6.0,4.1.11,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
97999,98000,Titus Andronicus,6.0,4.1.12,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care"
98000,98001,Titus Andronicus,6.0,4.1.13,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
98001,98002,Titus Andronicus,6.0,4.1.14,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
98002,98003,Titus Andronicus,7.0,4.1.15,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
98003,98004,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.16,Young LUCIUS,"My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,"
98004,98005,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.17,Young LUCIUS,Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:
98005,98006,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.18,Young LUCIUS,"For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,"
98006,98007,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.19,Young LUCIUS,"Extremity of griefs would make men mad,"
98007,98008,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.20,Young LUCIUS,And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
98008,98009,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.21,Young LUCIUS,"Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear,"
98009,98010,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.22,Young LUCIUS,"Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt"
98010,98011,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.23,Young LUCIUS,"Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,"
98011,98012,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.24,Young LUCIUS,"And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:"
98012,98013,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.25,Young LUCIUS,"Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--"
98013,98014,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.26,Young LUCIUS,"Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:"
98014,98015,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.27,Young LUCIUS,"And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,"
98015,98016,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.1.28,Young LUCIUS,I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
98016,98017,Titus Andronicus,9.0,4.1.29,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lucius, I will."
98017,98018,Titus Andronicus,9.0,,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall
98018,98019,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.30,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?"
98019,98020,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.31,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Some book there is that she desires to see.
98020,98021,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.32,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy."
98021,98022,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.33,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd"
98022,98023,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.34,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Come, and take choice of all my library,"
98023,98024,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.35,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens"
98024,98025,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.36,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
98025,98026,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.1.37,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
98026,98027,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.1.38,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,I think she means that there was more than one
98027,98028,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.1.39,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was,"
98028,98029,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.1.40,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
98029,98030,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.1.41,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?"
98030,98031,Titus Andronicus,13.0,4.1.42,Young LUCIUS,"Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses,"
98031,98032,Titus Andronicus,13.0,4.1.43,Young LUCIUS,My mother gave it me.
98032,98033,Titus Andronicus,14.0,4.1.44,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"For love of her that's gone,"
98033,98034,Titus Andronicus,14.0,4.1.45,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
98034,98035,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.1.46,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
98035,98036,Titus Andronicus,15.0,,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Helping her
98036,98037,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.1.47,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?"
98037,98038,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.1.48,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"This is the tragic tale of Philomel,"
98038,98039,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.1.49,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
98039,98040,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.1.50,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy."
98040,98041,Titus Andronicus,16.0,4.1.51,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"See, brother, see, note how she quotes the leaves."
98041,98042,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.1.52,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,"
98042,98043,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.1.53,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,"
98043,98044,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.1.54,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!"
98044,98045,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.1.55,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--"
98045,98046,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.1.56,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, had we never, never hunted there!--"
98046,98047,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.1.57,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,"
98047,98048,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.1.58,TITUS ANDRONICUS,By nature made for murders and for rapes.
98048,98049,Titus Andronicus,18.0,4.1.59,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, why should nature build so foul a den,"
98049,98050,Titus Andronicus,18.0,4.1.60,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
98050,98051,Titus Andronicus,19.0,4.1.61,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none"
98051,98052,Titus Andronicus,19.0,4.1.62,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"but friends,"
98052,98053,Titus Andronicus,19.0,4.1.63,TITUS ANDRONICUS,What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
98053,98054,Titus Andronicus,19.0,4.1.64,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,"
98054,98055,Titus Andronicus,19.0,4.1.65,TITUS ANDRONICUS,That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
98055,98056,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.66,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me."
98056,98057,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.67,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,"
98057,98058,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.68,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Inspire me, that I may this treason find!"
98058,98059,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.69,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:"
98059,98060,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.70,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This sandy plot is plain, guide, if thou canst"
98060,98061,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.71,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"This after me, when I have writ my name"
98061,98062,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.72,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Without the help of any hand at all.
98062,98063,Titus Andronicus,20.0,,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"He writes his name with his staff, and guides it with feet and mouth"
98063,98064,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.73,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
98064,98065,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.74,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Write thou good niece, and here display, at last,"
98065,98066,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.75,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"What God will have discover'd for revenge,"
98066,98067,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.76,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,"
98067,98068,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.1.77,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,That we may know the traitors and the truth!
98068,98069,Titus Andronicus,20.0,,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it with her stumps, and writes"
98069,98070,Titus Andronicus,21.0,4.1.78,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?"
98070,98071,Titus Andronicus,21.0,4.1.79,TITUS ANDRONICUS,'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'

98074,98075,Titus Andronicus,23.0,4.1.83,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
98075,98076,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.84,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"O, calm thee, gentle lord, although I know"
98076,98077,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.85,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,There is enough written upon this earth
98077,98078,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.86,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
98078,98079,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.87,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
98079,98080,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.88,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"My lord, kneel down with me, Lavinia, kneel,"
98080,98081,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.89,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope,"
98081,98082,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.90,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And swear with me, as, with the woful fere"

98086,98087,Titus Andronicus,24.0,4.1.95,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And see their blood, or die with this reproach."
98087,98088,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.96,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"'Tis sure enough, an you knew how."
98088,98089,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.97,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:"
98089,98090,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.98,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"The dam will wake, and, if she wind you once,"
98090,98091,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.99,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"She's with the lion deeply still in league,"
98091,98092,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.100,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,"
98092,98093,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.101,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
98093,98094,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.102,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"You are a young huntsman, Marcus, let it alone,"
98094,98095,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.103,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,"
98095,98096,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.104,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And with a gad of steel will write these words,"
98096,98097,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.105,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And lay it by: the angry northern wind
98097,98098,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.106,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,"
98098,98099,Titus Andronicus,25.0,4.1.107,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?"
98099,98100,Titus Andronicus,26.0,4.1.108,Young LUCIUS,"I say, my lord, that if I were a man,"
98100,98101,Titus Andronicus,26.0,4.1.109,Young LUCIUS,Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
98101,98102,Titus Andronicus,26.0,4.1.110,Young LUCIUS,For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.

98111,98112,Titus Andronicus,31.0,4.1.120,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No, boy, not so, I'll teach thee another course."
98112,98113,Titus Andronicus,31.0,4.1.121,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:"
98113,98114,Titus Andronicus,31.0,4.1.122,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
98114,98115,Titus Andronicus,31.0,4.1.123,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Ay, marry, will we, sir, and we'll be waited on."

98117,98118,Titus Andronicus,32.0,4.1.125,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And not relent, or not compassion him?"
98118,98119,Titus Andronicus,32.0,4.1.126,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,"
98119,98120,Titus Andronicus,32.0,4.1.127,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
98120,98121,Titus Andronicus,32.0,4.1.128,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield,"
98121,98122,Titus Andronicus,32.0,4.1.129,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,But yet so just that he will not revenge.
98122,98123,Titus Andronicus,32.0,4.1.130,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!"

98493,98494,Titus Andronicus,3.0,4.4.41,Clown,"Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial."
98494,98495,Titus Andronicus,4.0,4.4.42,TAMORA,"Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor."
98495,98496,Titus Andronicus,5.0,4.4.43,Clown,'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
98496,98497,Titus Andronicus,5.0,4.4.44,Clown,I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
98497,98498,Titus Andronicus,5.0,,Clown,SATURNINUS reads the letter
98498,98499,Titus Andronicus,6.0,4.4.45,SATURNINUS,"Go, take him away, and hang him presently."
98499,98500,Titus Andronicus,7.0,4.4.46,Clown,How much money must I have?
98500,98501,Titus Andronicus,8.0,4.4.47,TAMORA,"Come, sirrah, you must be hanged."
98501,98502,Titus Andronicus,9.0,4.4.48,Clown,"Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to"
98502,98503,Titus Andronicus,9.0,4.4.49,Clown,a fair end.
98503,98504,Titus Andronicus,9.0,,Clown,"Exit, guarded"
98504,98505,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.50,SATURNINUS,Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
98505,98506,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.51,SATURNINUS,Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
98506,98507,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.52,SATURNINUS,I know from whence this same device proceeds:
98507,98508,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.53,SATURNINUS,"May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,"
98508,98509,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.54,SATURNINUS,"That died by law for murder of our brother,"
98509,98510,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.55,SATURNINUS,Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
98510,98511,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.56,SATURNINUS,"Go, drag the villain hither by the hair,"
98511,98512,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.57,SATURNINUS,Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:
98512,98513,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.58,SATURNINUS,"For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman,"
98513,98514,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.59,SATURNINUS,"Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,"
98514,98515,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.60,SATURNINUS,In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
98515,98516,Titus Andronicus,10.0,,SATURNINUS,Enter AEMILIUS
98516,98517,Titus Andronicus,10.0,4.4.61,SATURNINUS,"What news with thee, AEmilius?"
98517,98518,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.4.62,AEMILIUS,"Arm, arm, my lord,--Rome never had more cause."
98518,98519,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.4.63,AEMILIUS,"The Goths have gather'd head, and with a power"
98519,98520,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.4.64,AEMILIUS,"high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,"
98520,98521,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.4.65,AEMILIUS,"They hither march amain, under conduct"
98521,98522,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.4.66,AEMILIUS,"Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus,"
98522,98523,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.4.67,AEMILIUS,"Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do"
98523,98524,Titus Andronicus,11.0,4.4.68,AEMILIUS,As much as ever Coriolanus did.
98524,98525,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.69,SATURNINUS,Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
98525,98526,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.70,SATURNINUS,"These tidings nip me, and I hang the head"
98526,98527,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.71,SATURNINUS,As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
98527,98528,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.72,SATURNINUS,"Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:"
98528,98529,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.73,SATURNINUS,"'Tis he the common people love so much,"
98529,98530,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.74,SATURNINUS,"Myself hath often over-heard them say,"
98530,98531,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.75,SATURNINUS,"When I have walked like a private man,"
98531,98532,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.76,SATURNINUS,"That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,"
98532,98533,Titus Andronicus,12.0,4.4.77,SATURNINUS,And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
98533,98534,Titus Andronicus,13.0,4.4.78,TAMORA,Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
98534,98535,Titus Andronicus,14.0,4.4.79,SATURNINUS,"Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,"
98535,98536,Titus Andronicus,14.0,4.4.80,SATURNINUS,And will revolt from me to succor him.
98536,98537,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.81,TAMORA,"King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name."
98537,98538,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.82,TAMORA,"Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?"
98538,98539,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.83,TAMORA,"The eagle suffers little birds to sing,"
98539,98540,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.84,TAMORA,"And is not careful what they mean thereby,"
98540,98541,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.85,TAMORA,Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
98541,98542,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.86,TAMORA,He can at pleasure stint their melody:
98542,98543,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.87,TAMORA,Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
98543,98544,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.88,TAMORA,"Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,"
98544,98545,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.89,TAMORA,I will enchant the old Andronicus
98545,98546,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.90,TAMORA,"With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,"
98546,98547,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.91,TAMORA,"Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,"
98547,98548,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.92,TAMORA,"When as the one is wounded with the bait,"
98548,98549,Titus Andronicus,15.0,4.4.93,TAMORA,The other rotted with delicious feed.
98549,98550,Titus Andronicus,16.0,4.4.94,SATURNINUS,But he will not entreat his son for us.
98550,98551,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.95,TAMORA,"If Tamora entreat him, then he will:"
98551,98552,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.96,TAMORA,For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
98552,98553,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.97,TAMORA,"With golden promises, that, were his heart"
98553,98554,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.98,TAMORA,"Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,"
98554,98555,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.99,TAMORA,Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
98555,98556,Titus Andronicus,17.0,,TAMORA,To AEmilius
98556,98557,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.100,TAMORA,"Go thou before, be our ambassador:"
98557,98558,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.101,TAMORA,Say that the emperor requests a parley
98558,98559,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.102,TAMORA,"Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting"
98559,98560,Titus Andronicus,17.0,4.4.103,TAMORA,"Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus."
98560,98561,Titus Andronicus,18.0,4.4.104,SATURNINUS,"AEmilius, do this message honourably:"
98561,98562,Titus Andronicus,18.0,4.4.105,SATURNINUS,"And if he stand on hostage for his safety,"
98562,98563,Titus Andronicus,18.0,4.4.106,SATURNINUS,Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
98563,98564,Titus Andronicus,19.0,4.4.107,AEMILIUS,Your bidding shall I do effectually.
98564,98565,Titus Andronicus,19.0,,AEMILIUS,Exit
98565,98566,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.4.108,TAMORA,"Now will I to that old Andronicus,"
98566,98567,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.4.109,TAMORA,"And temper him with all the art I have,"
98567,98568,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.4.110,TAMORA,To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.
98568,98569,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.4.111,TAMORA,"And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,"
98569,98570,Titus Andronicus,20.0,4.4.112,TAMORA,And bury all thy fear in my devices.
98570,98571,Titus Andronicus,21.0,4.4.113,SATURNINUS,"Then go successantly, and plead to him."
98571,98572,Titus Andronicus,21.0,,SATURNINUS,Exeunt

98573,98574,Titus Andronicus,21.0,,SATURNINUS,SCENE I. Plains near Rome.
98574,98575,Titus Andronicus,21.0,,SATURNINUS,"Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours"
98575,98576,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.1,LUCIUS,"Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,"
98576,98577,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.2,LUCIUS,"I have received letters from great Rome,"
98577,98578,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.3,LUCIUS,Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
98578,98579,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.4,LUCIUS,And how desirous of our sight they are.
98579,98580,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.5,LUCIUS,"Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,"
98580,98581,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.6,LUCIUS,"Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,"
98581,98582,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.7,LUCIUS,"And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,"
98582,98583,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.1.8,LUCIUS,Let him make treble satisfaction.
98583,98584,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.9,First Goth,"Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,"
98584,98585,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.10,First Goth,"Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,"
98585,98586,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.11,First Goth,Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
98586,98587,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.12,First Goth,"Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,"
98587,98588,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.13,First Goth,"Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,"
98588,98589,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.14,First Goth,Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
98589,98590,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.15,First Goth,"Led by their master to the flowered fields,"
98590,98591,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.1.16,First Goth,And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
98591,98592,Titus Andronicus,3.0,5.1.17,All the Goths,"And as he saith, so say we all with him."
98592,98593,Titus Andronicus,4.0,5.1.18,LUCIUS,"I humbly thank him, and I thank you all."
98593,98594,Titus Andronicus,4.0,5.1.19,LUCIUS,"But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?"
98594,98595,Titus Andronicus,4.0,,LUCIUS,"Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms"
98595,98596,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.20,Second Goth,"Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd"
98596,98597,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.21,Second Goth,"To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,"
98597,98598,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.22,Second Goth,"And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye"
98598,98599,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.23,Second Goth,"Upon the wasted building, suddenly"
98599,98600,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.24,Second Goth,I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
98600,98601,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.25,Second Goth,"I made unto the noise, when soon I heard"
98601,98602,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.26,Second Goth,The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
98602,98603,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.27,Second Goth,"'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!"
98603,98604,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.28,Second Goth,"Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,"
98604,98605,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.29,Second Goth,"Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,"
98605,98606,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.30,Second Goth,"Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:"
98606,98607,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.31,Second Goth,"But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,"
98607,98608,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.32,Second Goth,They never do beget a coal-black calf.
98608,98609,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.33,Second Goth,"Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates"
98609,98610,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.34,Second Goth,"the babe,--"
98610,98611,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.35,Second Goth,"'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,"
98611,98612,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.36,Second Goth,"Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,"
98612,98613,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.37,Second Goth,Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
98613,98614,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.38,Second Goth,"With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,"
98614,98615,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.39,Second Goth,"Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,"
98615,98616,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.1.40,Second Goth,To use as you think needful of the man.
98616,98617,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.41,LUCIUS,"O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil"
98617,98618,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.42,LUCIUS,"That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand,"
98618,98619,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.43,LUCIUS,"This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,"
98619,98620,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.44,LUCIUS,And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
98620,98621,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.45,LUCIUS,"Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey"
98621,98622,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.46,LUCIUS,This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
98622,98623,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.47,LUCIUS,"Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?"
98623,98624,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.48,LUCIUS,"A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree."
98624,98625,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.1.49,LUCIUS,And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
98625,98626,Titus Andronicus,7.0,5.1.50,AARON,"Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood."
98626,98627,Titus Andronicus,8.0,5.1.51,LUCIUS,Too like the sire for ever being good.
98627,98628,Titus Andronicus,8.0,5.1.52,LUCIUS,"First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl,"
98628,98629,Titus Andronicus,8.0,5.1.53,LUCIUS,A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
98629,98630,Titus Andronicus,8.0,5.1.54,LUCIUS,Get me a ladder.
98630,98631,Titus Andronicus,8.0,,LUCIUS,"A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend"
98631,98632,Titus Andronicus,9.0,5.1.55,AARON,"Lucius, save the child,"
98632,98633,Titus Andronicus,9.0,5.1.56,AARON,And bear it from me to the empress.
98633,98634,Titus Andronicus,9.0,5.1.57,AARON,"If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,"
98634,98635,Titus Andronicus,9.0,5.1.58,AARON,That highly may advantage thee to hear:
98635,98636,Titus Andronicus,9.0,5.1.59,AARON,"If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,"
98636,98637,Titus Andronicus,9.0,5.1.60,AARON,I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
98637,98638,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.1.61,LUCIUS,Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
98638,98639,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.1.62,LUCIUS,"Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd."
98639,98640,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.63,AARON,"An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,"
98640,98641,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.64,AARON,"'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak,"
98641,98642,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.65,AARON,"For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,"
98642,98643,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.66,AARON,"Acts of black night, abominable deeds,"
98643,98644,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.67,AARON,"Complots of mischief, treason, villanies"
98644,98645,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.68,AARON,"Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:"
98645,98646,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.69,AARON,"And this shall all be buried by my death,"
98646,98647,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.1.70,AARON,Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
98647,98648,Titus Andronicus,12.0,5.1.71,LUCIUS,"Tell on thy mind, I say thy child shall live."
98648,98649,Titus Andronicus,13.0,5.1.72,AARON,"Swear that he shall, and then I will begin."
98649,98650,Titus Andronicus,14.0,5.1.73,LUCIUS,Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
98650,98651,Titus Andronicus,14.0,5.1.74,LUCIUS,"That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?"
98651,98652,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.75,AARON,"What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not,"
98652,98653,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.76,AARON,"Yet, for I know thou art religious"
98653,98654,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.77,AARON,"And hast a thing within thee called conscience,"
98654,98655,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.78,AARON,"With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,"
98655,98656,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.79,AARON,"Which I have seen thee careful to observe,"
98656,98657,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.80,AARON,"Therefore I urge thy oath, for that I know"
98657,98658,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.81,AARON,An idiot holds his bauble for a god
98658,98659,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.82,AARON,"And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,"
98659,98660,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.83,AARON,To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
98660,98661,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.84,AARON,"By that same god, what god soe'er it be,"
98661,98662,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.85,AARON,"That thou adorest and hast in reverence,"
98662,98663,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.86,AARON,"To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,"
98663,98664,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.1.87,AARON,Or else I will discover nought to thee.
98664,98665,Titus Andronicus,16.0,5.1.88,LUCIUS,Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
98665,98666,Titus Andronicus,17.0,5.1.89,AARON,"First know thou, I begot him on the empress."
98666,98667,Titus Andronicus,18.0,5.1.90,LUCIUS,O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
98667,98668,Titus Andronicus,19.0,5.1.91,AARON,"Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity"
98668,98669,Titus Andronicus,19.0,5.1.92,AARON,To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
98669,98670,Titus Andronicus,19.0,5.1.93,AARON,"'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus,"
98670,98671,Titus Andronicus,19.0,5.1.94,AARON,They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
98671,98672,Titus Andronicus,19.0,5.1.95,AARON,And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
98672,98673,Titus Andronicus,20.0,5.1.96,LUCIUS,O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
98673,98674,Titus Andronicus,21.0,5.1.97,AARON,"Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas"
98674,98675,Titus Andronicus,21.0,5.1.98,AARON,Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
98675,98676,Titus Andronicus,22.0,5.1.99,LUCIUS,"O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!"
98676,98677,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.100,AARON,"Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:"
98677,98678,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.101,AARON,"That codding spirit had they from their mother,"
98678,98679,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.102,AARON,"As sure a card as ever won the set,"
98679,98680,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.103,AARON,"That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,"
98680,98681,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.104,AARON,As true a dog as ever fought at head.
98681,98682,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.105,AARON,"Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth."
98682,98683,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.106,AARON,I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
98683,98684,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.107,AARON,Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
98684,98685,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.108,AARON,I wrote the letter that thy father found
98685,98686,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.109,AARON,"And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,"
98686,98687,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.110,AARON,Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
98687,98688,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.111,AARON,"And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,"
98688,98689,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.112,AARON,Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
98689,98690,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.113,AARON,"I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,"
98690,98691,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.114,AARON,"And, when I had it, drew myself apart"
98691,98692,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.115,AARON,And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
98692,98693,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.116,AARON,I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
98693,98694,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.117,AARON,"When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads,"
98694,98695,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.118,AARON,"Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,"
98695,98696,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.119,AARON,That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
98696,98697,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.120,AARON,"And when I told the empress of this sport,"
98697,98698,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.121,AARON,"She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,"
98698,98699,Titus Andronicus,23.0,5.1.122,AARON,And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
98699,98700,Titus Andronicus,24.0,5.1.123,First Goth,"What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?"
98700,98701,Titus Andronicus,25.0,5.1.124,AARON,"Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is."
98701,98702,Titus Andronicus,26.0,5.1.125,LUCIUS,Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
98702,98703,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.126,AARON,"Ay, that I had not done a thousand more."
98703,98704,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.127,AARON,"Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,"
98704,98705,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.128,AARON,"Few come within the compass of my curse,--"
98705,98706,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.129,AARON,"Wherein I did not some notorious ill,"
98706,98707,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.130,AARON,"As kill a man, or else devise his death,"
98707,98708,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.131,AARON,"Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,"
98708,98709,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.132,AARON,"Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,"
98709,98710,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.133,AARON,"Set deadly enmity between two friends,"
98710,98711,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.134,AARON,"Make poor men's cattle break their necks,"
98711,98712,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.135,AARON,"Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,"
98712,98713,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.136,AARON,And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
98713,98714,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.137,AARON,"Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,"
98714,98715,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.138,AARON,"And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,"
98715,98716,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.139,AARON,"Even when their sorrows almost were forgot,"
98716,98717,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.140,AARON,"And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,"
98717,98718,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.141,AARON,"Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,"
98718,98719,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.142,AARON,"'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'"
98719,98720,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.143,AARON,"Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things"
98720,98721,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.144,AARON,"As willingly as one would kill a fly,"
98721,98722,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.145,AARON,And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
98722,98723,Titus Andronicus,27.0,5.1.146,AARON,But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
98723,98724,Titus Andronicus,28.0,5.1.147,LUCIUS,"Bring down the devil, for he must not die"
98724,98725,Titus Andronicus,28.0,5.1.148,LUCIUS,So sweet a death as hanging presently.
98725,98726,Titus Andronicus,29.0,5.1.149,AARON,"If there be devils, would I were a devil,"
98726,98727,Titus Andronicus,29.0,5.1.150,AARON,"To live and burn in everlasting fire,"
98727,98728,Titus Andronicus,29.0,5.1.151,AARON,"So I might have your company in hell,"
98728,98729,Titus Andronicus,29.0,5.1.152,AARON,But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
98729,98730,Titus Andronicus,30.0,5.1.153,LUCIUS,"Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more."
98730,98731,Titus Andronicus,30.0,,LUCIUS,Enter a Goth
98731,98732,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.1.154,Third Goth,"My lord, there is a messenger from Rome"
98732,98733,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.1.155,Third Goth,Desires to be admitted to your presence.
98733,98734,Titus Andronicus,32.0,5.1.156,LUCIUS,Let him come near.

98735,98736,Titus Andronicus,32.0,5.1.157,LUCIUS,"Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?"
98736,98737,Titus Andronicus,33.0,5.1.158,AEMILIUS,"Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,"
98737,98738,Titus Andronicus,33.0,5.1.159,AEMILIUS,"The Roman emperor greets you all by me,"
98738,98739,Titus Andronicus,33.0,5.1.160,AEMILIUS,"And, for he understands you are in arms,"
98739,98740,Titus Andronicus,33.0,5.1.161,AEMILIUS,"He craves a parley at your father's house,"
98740,98741,Titus Andronicus,33.0,5.1.162,AEMILIUS,"Willing you to demand your hostages,"
98741,98742,Titus Andronicus,33.0,5.1.163,AEMILIUS,And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
98742,98743,Titus Andronicus,34.0,5.1.164,First Goth,What says our general?
98743,98744,Titus Andronicus,35.0,5.1.165,LUCIUS,"AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges"
98744,98745,Titus Andronicus,35.0,5.1.166,LUCIUS,"Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,"
98745,98746,Titus Andronicus,35.0,5.1.167,LUCIUS,And we will come. March away.
98746,98747,Titus Andronicus,35.0,,LUCIUS,Exeunt

98750,98751,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.2.2,TAMORA,"I will encounter with Andronicus,"
98751,98752,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.2.3,TAMORA,"And say I am Revenge, sent from below"
98752,98753,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.2.4,TAMORA,To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
98753,98754,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.2.5,TAMORA,"Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,"
98754,98755,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.2.6,TAMORA,"To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge,"
98755,98756,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.2.7,TAMORA,"Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,"
98756,98757,Titus Andronicus,1.0,5.2.8,TAMORA,And work confusion on his enemies.

98760,98761,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.2.10,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Is it your trick to make me ope the door,"
98761,98762,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.2.11,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"That so my sad decrees may fly away,"
98762,98763,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.2.12,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And all my study be to no effect?
98763,98764,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.2.13,TITUS ANDRONICUS,You are deceived: for what I mean to do
98764,98765,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.2.14,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"See here in bloody lines I have set down,"
98765,98766,Titus Andronicus,2.0,5.2.15,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And what is written shall be executed.
98766,98767,Titus Andronicus,3.0,5.2.16,TAMORA,"Titus, I am come to talk with thee."
98767,98768,Titus Andronicus,4.0,5.2.17,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"No, not a word, how can I grace my talk,"
98768,98769,Titus Andronicus,4.0,5.2.18,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Wanting a hand to give it action?
98769,98770,Titus Andronicus,4.0,5.2.19,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Thou hast the odds of me, therefore no more."
98770,98771,Titus Andronicus,5.0,5.2.20,TAMORA,"If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me."
98771,98772,Titus Andronicus,6.0,5.2.21,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I am not mad, I know thee well enough:"

98787,98788,Titus Andronicus,7.0,5.2.37,TAMORA,Where bloody murder or detested rape
98788,98789,Titus Andronicus,7.0,5.2.38,TAMORA,"Can couch for fear, but I will find them out,"
98789,98790,Titus Andronicus,7.0,5.2.39,TAMORA,"And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,"

98798,98799,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.48,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,"
98799,98800,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.49,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And whirl along with thee about the globe.
98800,98801,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.50,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,"
98801,98802,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.51,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,"
98802,98803,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.52,TITUS ANDRONICUS,And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
98803,98804,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.53,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And when thy car is loaden with their heads,"
98804,98805,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.54,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel"

98806,98807,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.56,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
98807,98808,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.57,TITUS ANDRONICUS,Until his very downfall in the sea:
98808,98809,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.58,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And day by day I'll do this heavy task,"
98809,98810,Titus Andronicus,10.0,5.2.59,TITUS ANDRONICUS,So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
98810,98811,Titus Andronicus,11.0,5.2.60,TAMORA,"These are my ministers, and come with me."

98812,98813,Titus Andronicus,13.0,5.2.62,TAMORA,"Rapine and Murder, therefore called so,"
98813,98814,Titus Andronicus,13.0,5.2.63,TAMORA,Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
98814,98815,Titus Andronicus,14.0,5.2.64,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!"
98815,98816,Titus Andronicus,14.0,5.2.65,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"And you, the empress! but we worldly men"
98816,98817,Titus Andronicus,14.0,5.2.66,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes."
98817,98818,Titus Andronicus,14.0,5.2.67,TITUS ANDRONICUS,"O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee,"

98823,98824,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.72,TAMORA,"Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,"
98824,98825,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.73,TAMORA,"For now he firmly takes me for Revenge,"
98825,98826,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.74,TAMORA,"And, being credulous in this mad thought,"
98826,98827,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.75,TAMORA,"I'll make him send for Lucius his son,"
98827,98828,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.76,TAMORA,"And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,"
98828,98829,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.77,TAMORA,"I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,"
98829,98830,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.78,TAMORA,"To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,"
98830,98831,Titus Andronicus,15.0,5.2.79,TAMORA,"Or, at the least, make them his enemies."

98839,98840,Titus Andronicus,16.0,5.2.87,TITUS ANDRONICUS,For well I wot the empress never wags

99087,99088,Titus Andronicus,30.0,5.3.109,LUCIUS,And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
99088,99089,Titus Andronicus,30.0,5.3.110,LUCIUS,"I am the turned forth, be it known to you,"
99089,99090,Titus Andronicus,30.0,5.3.111,LUCIUS,"That have preserved her welfare in my blood,"

99092,99093,Titus Andronicus,30.0,5.3.114,LUCIUS,"Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I,"
99093,99094,Titus Andronicus,30.0,5.3.115,LUCIUS,"My scars can witness, dumb although they are,"
99094,99095,Titus Andronicus,30.0,5.3.116,LUCIUS,That my report is just and full of truth.

99104,99105,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.125,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And as he is, to witness this is true."
99105,99106,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.126,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
99106,99107,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.127,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,"
99107,99108,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.128,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Or more than any living man could bear.
99108,99109,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.129,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?"
99109,99110,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.130,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,"
99110,99111,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.131,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And, from the place where you behold us now,"
99111,99112,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.132,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,The poor remainder of Andronici
99112,99113,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.133,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down."
99113,99114,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.134,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,"
99114,99115,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.135,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,And make a mutual closure of our house.
99115,99116,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.136,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,"
99116,99117,Titus Andronicus,31.0,5.3.137,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,"Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall."

99126,99127,Titus Andronicus,34.0,5.3.146,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,As punishment for his most wicked life.
99127,99128,Titus Andronicus,34.0,,MARCUS ANDRONICUS,Exeunt Attendants

99135,99136,Titus Andronicus,36.0,5.3.153,LUCIUS,To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.

99152,99153,Titus Andronicus,38.0,5.3.169,LUCIUS,Because kind nature doth require it so:
99153,99154,Titus Andronicus,38.0,5.3.170,LUCIUS,Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
99154,99155,Titus Andronicus,38.0,5.3.171,LUCIUS,"Bid him farewell, commit him to the grave,"

99167,99168,Titus Andronicus,41.0,5.3.183,LUCIUS,For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
99168,99169,Titus Andronicus,41.0,5.3.184,LUCIUS,Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.

99171,99172,Titus Andronicus,42.0,5.3.187,AARON,I should repent the evils I have done:
99172,99173,Titus Andronicus,42.0,5.3.188,AARON,Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
99173,99174,Titus Andronicus,42.0,5.3.189,AARON,"Would I perform, if I might have my will,"

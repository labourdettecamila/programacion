40073,40074,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.1,Chorus,"I come no more to make you laugh: things now,"
40074,40075,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.2,Chorus,"That bear a weighty and a serious brow,"
40075,40076,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.3,Chorus,"Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,"
40076,40077,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.4,Chorus,"Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,"
40077,40078,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.5,Chorus,"We now present. Those that can pity, here"
40078,40079,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.6,Chorus,"May, if they think it well, let fall a tear,"
40079,40080,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.7,Chorus,The subject will deserve it. Such as give
40080,40081,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.8,Chorus,"Their money out of hope they may believe,"
40081,40082,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.9,Chorus,May here find truth too. Those that come to see
40082,40083,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.10,Chorus,"Only a show or two, and so agree"
40083,40084,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.11,Chorus,"The play may pass, if they be still and willing,"
40084,40085,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.12,Chorus,I'll undertake may see away their shilling
40085,40086,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.13,Chorus,Richly in two short hours. Only they
40086,40087,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.14,Chorus,"That come to hear a merry bawdy play,"
40087,40088,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.15,Chorus,"A noise of targets, or to see a fellow"
40088,40089,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.16,Chorus,"In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,"
40089,40090,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.17,Chorus,"Will be deceived, for, gentle hearers, know,"
40090,40091,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.18,Chorus,To rank our chosen truth with such a show
40091,40092,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.19,Chorus,"As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting"
40092,40093,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.20,Chorus,"Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,"
40093,40094,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.21,Chorus,"To make that only true we now intend,"
40094,40095,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.22,Chorus,Will leave us never an understanding friend.
40095,40096,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.23,Chorus,"Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known"
40096,40097,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.24,Chorus,"The first and happiest hearers of the town,"
40097,40098,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.25,Chorus,"Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see"
40098,40099,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.26,Chorus,The very persons of our noble story
40099,40100,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.27,Chorus,"As they were living, think you see them great,"
40100,40101,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.28,Chorus,And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
40101,40102,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.29,Chorus,"Of thousand friends, then in a moment, see"
40102,40103,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.30,Chorus,How soon this mightiness meets misery:
40103,40104,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.31,Chorus,"And, if you can be merry then, I'll say"
40104,40105,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.32,Chorus,A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
40105,40106,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.32,Chorus,SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.
40106,40107,Henry VIII,83.0,1.0.32,Chorus,"Enter NORFOLK at one door, at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY"
40107,40108,Henry VIII,1.0,1.1.1,BUCKINGHAM,"Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done"
40108,40109,Henry VIII,1.0,1.1.2,BUCKINGHAM,Since last we saw in France?
40109,40110,Henry VIII,2.0,1.1.3,NORFOLK,"I thank your grace,"
40110,40111,Henry VIII,2.0,1.1.4,NORFOLK,"Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer"
40111,40112,Henry VIII,2.0,1.1.5,NORFOLK,Of what I saw there.
40112,40113,Henry VIII,3.0,1.1.6,BUCKINGHAM,An untimely ague
40113,40114,Henry VIII,3.0,1.1.7,BUCKINGHAM,Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
40114,40115,Henry VIII,3.0,1.1.8,BUCKINGHAM,"Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,"
40115,40116,Henry VIII,3.0,1.1.9,BUCKINGHAM,Met in the vale of Andren.
40116,40117,Henry VIII,4.0,1.1.10,NORFOLK,'Twixt Guynes and Arde:
40117,40118,Henry VIII,4.0,1.1.11,NORFOLK,"I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,"
40118,40119,Henry VIII,4.0,1.1.12,NORFOLK,"Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung"
40119,40120,Henry VIII,4.0,1.1.13,NORFOLK,"In their embracement, as they grew together,"
40120,40121,Henry VIII,4.0,1.1.14,NORFOLK,"Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd"
40121,40122,Henry VIII,4.0,1.1.15,NORFOLK,Such a compounded one?
40122,40123,Henry VIII,5.0,1.1.16,BUCKINGHAM,All the whole time
40123,40124,Henry VIII,5.0,1.1.17,BUCKINGHAM,I was my chamber's prisoner.
40124,40125,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.18,NORFOLK,Then you lost
40125,40126,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.19,NORFOLK,"The view of earthly glory: men might say,"
40126,40127,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.20,NORFOLK,"Till this time pomp was single, but now married"
40127,40128,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.21,NORFOLK,To one above itself. Each following day
40128,40129,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.22,NORFOLK,"Became the next day's master, till the last"
40129,40130,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.23,NORFOLK,"Made former wonders its. To-day the French,"
40130,40131,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.24,NORFOLK,"All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,"
40131,40132,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.25,NORFOLK,"Shone down the English, and, to-morrow, they"
40132,40133,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.26,NORFOLK,Made Britain India: every man that stood
40133,40134,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.27,NORFOLK,Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
40134,40135,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.28,NORFOLK,"As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,"
40135,40136,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.29,NORFOLK,"Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear"
40136,40137,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.30,NORFOLK,"The pride upon them, that their very labour"
40137,40138,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.31,NORFOLK,Was to them as a painting: now this masque
40138,40139,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.32,NORFOLK,"Was cried incomparable, and the ensuing night"
40139,40140,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.33,NORFOLK,"Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,"
40140,40141,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.34,NORFOLK,"Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,"
40141,40142,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.35,NORFOLK,"As presence did present them, him in eye,"
40142,40143,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.36,NORFOLK,"Still him in praise: and, being present both"
40143,40144,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.37,NORFOLK,"'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner"
40144,40145,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.38,NORFOLK,Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
40145,40146,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.39,NORFOLK,For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
40146,40147,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.40,NORFOLK,"The noble spirits to arms, they did perform"
40147,40148,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.41,NORFOLK,"Beyond thought's compass, that former fabulous story,"
40148,40149,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.42,NORFOLK,"Being now seen possible enough, got credit,"
40149,40150,Henry VIII,6.0,1.1.43,NORFOLK,That Bevis was believed.
40150,40151,Henry VIII,7.0,1.1.44,BUCKINGHAM,"O, you go far."
40151,40152,Henry VIII,8.0,1.1.45,NORFOLK,As I belong to worship and affect
40152,40153,Henry VIII,8.0,1.1.46,NORFOLK,"In honour honesty, the tract of every thing"
40153,40154,Henry VIII,8.0,1.1.47,NORFOLK,"Would by a good discourser lose some life,"
40154,40155,Henry VIII,8.0,1.1.48,NORFOLK,"Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal,"
40155,40156,Henry VIII,8.0,1.1.49,NORFOLK,To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.
40156,40157,Henry VIII,8.0,1.1.50,NORFOLK,"Order gave each thing view, the office did"
40157,40158,Henry VIII,8.0,1.1.51,NORFOLK,Distinctly his full function.
40158,40159,Henry VIII,9.0,1.1.52,BUCKINGHAM,"Who did guide,"
40159,40160,Henry VIII,9.0,1.1.53,BUCKINGHAM,"I mean, who set the body and the limbs"
40160,40161,Henry VIII,9.0,1.1.54,BUCKINGHAM,"Of this great sport together, as you guess?"
40161,40162,Henry VIII,10.0,1.1.55,NORFOLK,"One, certes, that promises no element"
40162,40163,Henry VIII,10.0,1.1.56,NORFOLK,In such a business.
40163,40164,Henry VIII,11.0,1.1.57,BUCKINGHAM,"I pray you, who, my lord?"
40164,40165,Henry VIII,12.0,1.1.58,NORFOLK,All this was order'd by the good discretion
40165,40166,Henry VIII,12.0,1.1.59,NORFOLK,Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.
40166,40167,Henry VIII,13.0,1.1.60,BUCKINGHAM,The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
40167,40168,Henry VIII,13.0,1.1.61,BUCKINGHAM,From his ambitious finger. What had he
40168,40169,Henry VIII,13.0,1.1.62,BUCKINGHAM,To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
40169,40170,Henry VIII,13.0,1.1.63,BUCKINGHAM,That such a keech can with his very bulk
40170,40171,Henry VIII,13.0,1.1.64,BUCKINGHAM,Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
40171,40172,Henry VIII,13.0,1.1.65,BUCKINGHAM,And keep it from the earth.
40172,40173,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.66,NORFOLK,"Surely, sir,"
40173,40174,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.67,NORFOLK,"There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends,"
40174,40175,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.68,NORFOLK,"For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace"
40175,40176,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.69,NORFOLK,"Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon"
40176,40177,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.70,NORFOLK,"For high feats done to the crown, neither allied"
40177,40178,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.71,NORFOLK,"For eminent assistants, but, spider-like,"
40178,40179,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.72,NORFOLK,"Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,"
40179,40180,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.73,NORFOLK,The force of his own merit makes his way
40180,40181,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.74,NORFOLK,"A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys"
40181,40182,Henry VIII,14.0,1.1.75,NORFOLK,A place next to the king.
40182,40183,Henry VIII,15.0,1.1.76,ABERGAVENNY,I cannot tell
40183,40184,Henry VIII,15.0,1.1.77,ABERGAVENNY,"What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye"
40184,40185,Henry VIII,15.0,1.1.78,ABERGAVENNY,"Pierce into that, but I can see his pride"
40185,40186,Henry VIII,15.0,1.1.79,ABERGAVENNY,"Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,"
40186,40187,Henry VIII,15.0,1.1.80,ABERGAVENNY,"If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,"
40187,40188,Henry VIII,15.0,1.1.81,ABERGAVENNY,"Or has given all before, and he begins"
40188,40189,Henry VIII,15.0,1.1.82,ABERGAVENNY,A new hell in himself.
40189,40190,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.83,BUCKINGHAM,"Why the devil,"
40190,40191,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.84,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon this French going out, took he upon him,"
40191,40192,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.85,BUCKINGHAM,"Without the privity o' the king, to appoint"
40192,40193,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.86,BUCKINGHAM,Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
40193,40194,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.87,BUCKINGHAM,"Of all the gentry, for the most part such"
40194,40195,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.88,BUCKINGHAM,To whom as great a charge as little honour
40195,40196,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.89,BUCKINGHAM,"He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,"
40196,40197,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.90,BUCKINGHAM,"The honourable board of council out,"
40197,40198,Henry VIII,16.0,1.1.91,BUCKINGHAM,Must fetch him in the papers.
40198,40199,Henry VIII,17.0,1.1.92,ABERGAVENNY,I do know
40199,40200,Henry VIII,17.0,1.1.93,ABERGAVENNY,"Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have"
40200,40201,Henry VIII,17.0,1.1.94,ABERGAVENNY,"By this so sickened their estates, that never"
40201,40202,Henry VIII,17.0,1.1.95,ABERGAVENNY,They shall abound as formerly.
40202,40203,Henry VIII,18.0,1.1.96,BUCKINGHAM,"O, many"
40203,40204,Henry VIII,18.0,1.1.97,BUCKINGHAM,Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
40204,40205,Henry VIII,18.0,1.1.98,BUCKINGHAM,For this great journey. What did this vanity
40205,40206,Henry VIII,18.0,1.1.99,BUCKINGHAM,But minister communication of
40206,40207,Henry VIII,18.0,1.1.100,BUCKINGHAM,A most poor issue?
40207,40208,Henry VIII,19.0,1.1.101,NORFOLK,"Grievingly I think,"
40208,40209,Henry VIII,19.0,1.1.102,NORFOLK,The peace between the French and us not values
40209,40210,Henry VIII,19.0,1.1.103,NORFOLK,The cost that did conclude it.
40210,40211,Henry VIII,20.0,1.1.104,BUCKINGHAM,"Every man,"
40211,40212,Henry VIII,20.0,1.1.105,BUCKINGHAM,"After the hideous storm that follow'd, was"
40212,40213,Henry VIII,20.0,1.1.106,BUCKINGHAM,"A thing inspired, and, not consulting, broke"
40213,40214,Henry VIII,20.0,1.1.107,BUCKINGHAM,"Into a general prophecy, That this tempest,"
40214,40215,Henry VIII,20.0,1.1.108,BUCKINGHAM,"Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded"
40215,40216,Henry VIII,20.0,1.1.109,BUCKINGHAM,The sudden breach on't.
40216,40217,Henry VIII,21.0,1.1.110,NORFOLK,"Which is budded out,"
40217,40218,Henry VIII,21.0,1.1.111,NORFOLK,"For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd"
40218,40219,Henry VIII,21.0,1.1.112,NORFOLK,Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.
40219,40220,Henry VIII,22.0,1.1.113,ABERGAVENNY,Is it therefore
40220,40221,Henry VIII,22.0,1.1.114,ABERGAVENNY,The ambassador is silenced?
40221,40222,Henry VIII,23.0,1.1.115,NORFOLK,"Marry, is't."
40222,40223,Henry VIII,24.0,1.1.116,ABERGAVENNY,"A proper title of a peace, and purchased"
40223,40224,Henry VIII,24.0,1.1.117,ABERGAVENNY,At a superfluous rate!
40224,40225,Henry VIII,25.0,1.1.118,BUCKINGHAM,"Why, all this business"
40225,40226,Henry VIII,25.0,1.1.119,BUCKINGHAM,Our reverend cardinal carried.
40226,40227,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.120,NORFOLK,"Like it your grace,"
40227,40228,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.121,NORFOLK,The state takes notice of the private difference
40228,40229,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.122,NORFOLK,Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
40229,40230,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.123,NORFOLK,And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
40230,40231,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.124,NORFOLK,Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
40231,40232,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.125,NORFOLK,The cardinal's malice and his potency
40232,40233,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.126,NORFOLK,"Together, to consider further that"
40233,40234,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.127,NORFOLK,What his high hatred would effect wants not
40234,40235,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.128,NORFOLK,"A minister in his power. You know his nature,"
40235,40236,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.129,NORFOLK,"That he's revengeful, and I know his sword"
40236,40237,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.130,NORFOLK,"Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,"
40237,40238,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.131,NORFOLK,"It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,"
40238,40239,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.132,NORFOLK,"Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,"
40239,40240,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.133,NORFOLK,"You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock"
40240,40241,Henry VIII,26.0,1.1.134,NORFOLK,That I advise your shunning.
40241,40242,Henry VIII,26.0,,NORFOLK,"Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,  certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain"
40242,40243,Henry VIII,27.0,1.1.135,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?"
40243,40244,Henry VIII,27.0,1.1.136,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Where's his examination?
40244,40245,Henry VIII,28.0,1.1.137,First Secretary,"Here, so please you."
40245,40246,Henry VIII,29.0,1.1.138,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Is he in person ready?
40246,40247,Henry VIII,30.0,1.1.139,First Secretary,"Ay, please your grace."
40247,40248,Henry VIII,31.0,1.1.140,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham"
40248,40249,Henry VIII,31.0,1.1.141,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Shall lessen this big look.
40249,40250,Henry VIII,31.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train
40250,40251,Henry VIII,32.0,1.1.142,BUCKINGHAM,"This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I"
40251,40252,Henry VIII,32.0,1.1.143,BUCKINGHAM,"Have not the power to muzzle him, therefore best"
40252,40253,Henry VIII,32.0,1.1.144,BUCKINGHAM,Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
40253,40254,Henry VIII,32.0,1.1.145,BUCKINGHAM,Outworths a noble's blood.
40254,40255,Henry VIII,33.0,1.1.146,NORFOLK,"What, are you chafed?"
40255,40256,Henry VIII,33.0,1.1.147,NORFOLK,"Ask God for temperance, that's the appliance only"
40256,40257,Henry VIII,33.0,1.1.148,NORFOLK,Which your disease requires.
40257,40258,Henry VIII,34.0,1.1.149,BUCKINGHAM,I read in's looks
40258,40259,Henry VIII,34.0,1.1.150,BUCKINGHAM,"Matter against me, and his eye reviled"
40259,40260,Henry VIII,34.0,1.1.151,BUCKINGHAM,"Me, as his abject object: at this instant"
40260,40261,Henry VIII,34.0,1.1.152,BUCKINGHAM,"He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king,"
40261,40262,Henry VIII,34.0,1.1.153,BUCKINGHAM,I'll follow and outstare him.
40262,40263,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.154,NORFOLK,"Stay, my lord,"
40263,40264,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.155,NORFOLK,And let your reason with your choler question
40264,40265,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.156,NORFOLK,What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
40265,40266,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.157,NORFOLK,Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
40266,40267,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.158,NORFOLK,"A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,"
40267,40268,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.159,NORFOLK,Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
40268,40269,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.160,NORFOLK,Can advise me like you: be to yourself
40269,40270,Henry VIII,35.0,1.1.161,NORFOLK,As you would to your friend.
40270,40271,Henry VIII,36.0,1.1.162,BUCKINGHAM,"I'll to the king,"
40271,40272,Henry VIII,36.0,1.1.163,BUCKINGHAM,And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
40272,40273,Henry VIII,36.0,1.1.164,BUCKINGHAM,"This Ipswich fellow's insolence, or proclaim"
40273,40274,Henry VIII,36.0,1.1.165,BUCKINGHAM,There's difference in no persons.
40274,40275,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.166,NORFOLK,"Be advised,"
40275,40276,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.167,NORFOLK,Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
40276,40277,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.168,NORFOLK,"That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,"
40277,40278,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.169,NORFOLK,"By violent swiftness, that which we run at,"
40278,40279,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.170,NORFOLK,"And lose by over-running. Know you not,"
40279,40280,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.171,NORFOLK,"The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,"
40280,40281,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.172,NORFOLK,In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:
40281,40282,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.173,NORFOLK,"I say again, there is no English soul"
40282,40283,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.174,NORFOLK,"More stronger to direct you than yourself,"
40283,40284,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.175,NORFOLK,"If with the sap of reason you would quench,"
40284,40285,Henry VIII,37.0,1.1.176,NORFOLK,"Or but allay, the fire of passion."
40285,40286,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.177,BUCKINGHAM,"Sir,"
40286,40287,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.178,BUCKINGHAM,"I am thankful to you, and I'll go along"
40287,40288,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.179,BUCKINGHAM,"By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,"
40288,40289,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.180,BUCKINGHAM,Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
40289,40290,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.181,BUCKINGHAM,"From sincere motions, by intelligence,"
40290,40291,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.182,BUCKINGHAM,And proofs as clear as founts in July when
40291,40292,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.183,BUCKINGHAM,"We see each grain of gravel, I do know"
40292,40293,Henry VIII,38.0,1.1.184,BUCKINGHAM,To be corrupt and treasonous.
40293,40294,Henry VIII,39.0,1.1.185,NORFOLK,Say not 'treasonous.'
40294,40295,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.186,BUCKINGHAM,"To the king I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong"
40295,40296,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.187,BUCKINGHAM,"As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,"
40296,40297,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.188,BUCKINGHAM,"Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous"
40297,40298,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.189,BUCKINGHAM,"As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief"
40298,40299,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.190,BUCKINGHAM,"As able to perform't, his mind and place"
40299,40300,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.191,BUCKINGHAM,"Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--"
40300,40301,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.192,BUCKINGHAM,Only to show his pomp as well in France
40301,40302,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.193,BUCKINGHAM,"As here at home, suggests the king our master"
40302,40303,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.194,BUCKINGHAM,"To this last costly treaty, the interview,"
40303,40304,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.195,BUCKINGHAM,"That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass"
40304,40305,Henry VIII,40.0,1.1.196,BUCKINGHAM,Did break i' the rinsing.
40305,40306,Henry VIII,41.0,1.1.197,NORFOLK,"Faith, and so it did."
40306,40307,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.198,BUCKINGHAM,"Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal"
40307,40308,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.199,BUCKINGHAM,The articles o' the combination drew
40308,40309,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.200,BUCKINGHAM,"As himself pleased, and they were ratified"
40309,40310,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.201,BUCKINGHAM,As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end
40310,40311,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.202,BUCKINGHAM,As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal
40311,40312,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.203,BUCKINGHAM,"Has done this, and 'tis well, for worthy Wolsey,"
40312,40313,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.204,BUCKINGHAM,"Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--"
40313,40314,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.205,BUCKINGHAM,"Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy"
40314,40315,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.206,BUCKINGHAM,"To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,"
40315,40316,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.207,BUCKINGHAM,Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
40316,40317,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.208,BUCKINGHAM,"For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came"
40317,40318,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.209,BUCKINGHAM,"To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:"
40318,40319,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.210,BUCKINGHAM,"His fears were, that the interview betwixt"
40319,40320,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.211,BUCKINGHAM,"England and France might, through their amity,"
40320,40321,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.212,BUCKINGHAM,"Breed him some prejudice, for from this league"
40321,40322,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.213,BUCKINGHAM,Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily
40322,40323,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.214,BUCKINGHAM,"Deals with our cardinal, and, as I trow,--"
40323,40324,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.215,BUCKINGHAM,"Which I do well, for I am sure the emperor"
40324,40325,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.216,BUCKINGHAM,"Paid ere he promised, whereby his suit was granted"
40325,40326,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.217,BUCKINGHAM,"Ere it was ask'd, but when the way was made,"
40326,40327,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.218,BUCKINGHAM,"And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,"
40327,40328,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.219,BUCKINGHAM,"That he would please to alter the king's course,"
40328,40329,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.220,BUCKINGHAM,"And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,"
40329,40330,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.221,BUCKINGHAM,"As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal"
40330,40331,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.222,BUCKINGHAM,"Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,"
40331,40332,Henry VIII,42.0,1.1.223,BUCKINGHAM,And for his own advantage.
40332,40333,Henry VIII,43.0,1.1.224,NORFOLK,I am sorry
40333,40334,Henry VIII,43.0,1.1.225,NORFOLK,"To hear this of him, and could wish he were"
40334,40335,Henry VIII,43.0,1.1.226,NORFOLK,Something mistaken in't.
40335,40336,Henry VIII,44.0,1.1.227,BUCKINGHAM,"No, not a syllable:"
40336,40337,Henry VIII,44.0,1.1.228,BUCKINGHAM,I  do pronounce him in that very shape
40337,40338,Henry VIII,44.0,1.1.229,BUCKINGHAM,He shall appear in proof.
40338,40339,Henry VIII,44.0,,BUCKINGHAM,"Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the Guard"

40340,40341,Henry VIII,46.0,1.1.231,Sergeant,"Sir,"

40346,40347,Henry VIII,47.0,1.1.237,BUCKINGHAM,The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
40347,40348,Henry VIII,47.0,1.1.238,BUCKINGHAM,Under device and practise.
40348,40349,Henry VIII,48.0,1.1.239,BRANDON,I am sorry

40354,40355,Henry VIII,49.0,1.1.245,BUCKINGHAM,Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven

40356,40357,Henry VIII,49.0,1.1.247,BUCKINGHAM,"O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!"
40357,40358,Henry VIII,50.0,1.1.248,BRANDON,"Nay, he must bear you company. The king"

40369,40370,Henry VIII,53.0,1.1.259,BUCKINGHAM,"These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope."
40370,40371,Henry VIII,54.0,1.1.260,BRANDON,A monk o' the Chartreux.

40425,40426,Henry VIII,8.0,1.2.44,KING HENRY VIII,"You that are blamed for it alike with us,"
40426,40427,Henry VIII,8.0,1.2.45,KING HENRY VIII,Know you of this taxation?
40427,40428,Henry VIII,9.0,1.2.46,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Please you, sir,"

40437,40438,Henry VIII,10.0,1.2.56,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Most pestilent to the bearing, and, to bear 'em,"
40438,40439,Henry VIII,10.0,1.2.57,QUEEN KATHARINE,The back is sacrifice to the load. They say

40442,40443,Henry VIII,11.0,1.2.61,KING HENRY VIII,"The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,"
40443,40444,Henry VIII,11.0,1.2.62,KING HENRY VIII,Is this exaction?
40444,40445,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.63,QUEEN KATHARINE,I am much too venturous
40445,40446,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.64,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In tempting of your patience, but am bolden'd"
40446,40447,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.65,QUEEN KATHARINE,Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief
40447,40448,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.66,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Comes through commissions, which compel from each"
40448,40449,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.67,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The sixth part of his substance, to be levied"
40449,40450,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.68,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Without delay, and the pretence for this"
40450,40451,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.69,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:"
40451,40452,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.70,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze"
40452,40453,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.71,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Allegiance in them, their curses now"
40453,40454,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.72,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,"
40454,40455,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.73,QUEEN KATHARINE,This tractable obedience is a slave
40455,40456,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.74,QUEEN KATHARINE,To each incensed will. I would your highness
40456,40457,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.75,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Would give it quick consideration, for"
40457,40458,Henry VIII,12.0,1.2.76,QUEEN KATHARINE,There is no primer business.
40458,40459,Henry VIII,13.0,1.2.77,KING HENRY VIII,"By my life,"
40459,40460,Henry VIII,13.0,1.2.78,KING HENRY VIII,This is against our pleasure.
40460,40461,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.79,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And for me,"
40461,40462,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.80,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I have no further gone in this than by
40462,40463,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.81,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A single voice, and that not pass'd me but"
40463,40464,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.82,CARDINAL WOLSEY,By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
40464,40465,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.83,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know"
40465,40466,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.84,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My faculties nor person, yet will be"
40466,40467,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.85,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The chronicles of my doing, let me say"
40467,40468,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.86,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake"
40468,40469,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.87,CARDINAL WOLSEY,That virtue must go through. We must not stint
40469,40470,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.88,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Our necessary actions, in the fear"
40470,40471,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.89,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To cope malicious censurers, which ever,"
40471,40472,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.90,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow"
40472,40473,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.91,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further"
40473,40474,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.92,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,"
40474,40475,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.93,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is"
40475,40476,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.94,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Not ours, or not allow'd, what worst, as oft,"
40476,40477,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.95,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up"
40477,40478,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.96,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For our best act. If we shall stand still,"
40478,40479,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.97,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,"
40479,40480,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.98,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"We should take root here where we sit, or sit"
40480,40481,Henry VIII,14.0,1.2.99,CARDINAL WOLSEY,State-statues only.
40481,40482,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.100,KING HENRY VIII,"Things done well,"
40482,40483,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.101,KING HENRY VIII,"And with a care, exempt themselves from fear,"

40484,40485,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.103,KING HENRY VIII,Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent
40485,40486,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.104,KING HENRY VIII,"Of this commission? I believe, not any."
40486,40487,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.105,KING HENRY VIII,"We must not rend our subjects from our laws,"
40487,40488,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.106,KING HENRY VIII,And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
40488,40489,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.107,KING HENRY VIII,"A trembling contribution! Why, we take"
40489,40490,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.108,KING HENRY VIII,"From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber,"
40490,40491,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.109,KING HENRY VIII,"And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,"
40491,40492,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.110,KING HENRY VIII,The air will drink the sap. To every county
40492,40493,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.111,KING HENRY VIII,"Where this is question'd send our letters, with"
40493,40494,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.112,KING HENRY VIII,Free pardon to each man that has denied

40495,40496,Henry VIII,15.0,1.2.114,KING HENRY VIII,I put it to your care.
40496,40497,Henry VIII,16.0,1.2.115,CARDINAL WOLSEY,A word with you.
40497,40498,Henry VIII,16.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,To the Secretary
40498,40499,Henry VIII,16.0,1.2.116,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let there be letters writ to every shire,"
40499,40500,Henry VIII,16.0,1.2.117,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons
40500,40501,Henry VIII,16.0,1.2.118,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Hardly conceive of me, let it be noised"
40501,40502,Henry VIII,16.0,1.2.119,CARDINAL WOLSEY,That through our intercession this revokement
40502,40503,Henry VIII,16.0,1.2.120,CARDINAL WOLSEY,And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you
40503,40504,Henry VIII,16.0,1.2.121,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Further in the proceeding.

40506,40507,Henry VIII,17.0,1.2.122,QUEEN KATHARINE,I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
40507,40508,Henry VIII,17.0,1.2.123,QUEEN KATHARINE,Is run in your displeasure.
40508,40509,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.124,KING HENRY VIII,It grieves many:
40509,40510,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.125,KING HENRY VIII,"The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker,"
40510,40511,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.126,KING HENRY VIII,"To nature none more bound, his training such,"
40511,40512,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.127,KING HENRY VIII,"That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,"
40512,40513,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.128,KING HENRY VIII,"And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,"
40513,40514,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.129,KING HENRY VIII,When these so noble benefits shall prove
40514,40515,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.130,KING HENRY VIII,"Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,"
40515,40516,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.131,KING HENRY VIII,"They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly"
40516,40517,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.132,KING HENRY VIII,"Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,"
40517,40518,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.133,KING HENRY VIII,"Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,"
40518,40519,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.134,KING HENRY VIII,"Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find"
40519,40520,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.135,KING HENRY VIII,"His hour of speech a minute, he, my lady,"
40520,40521,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.136,KING HENRY VIII,Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
40521,40522,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.137,KING HENRY VIII,"That once were his, and is become as black"
40522,40523,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.138,KING HENRY VIII,"As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us, you shall hear--"
40523,40524,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.139,KING HENRY VIII,This was his gentleman in trust--of him
40524,40525,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.140,KING HENRY VIII,Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
40525,40526,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.141,KING HENRY VIII,"The fore-recited practises, whereof"
40526,40527,Henry VIII,18.0,1.2.142,KING HENRY VIII,"We cannot feel too little, hear too much."
40527,40528,Henry VIII,19.0,1.2.143,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,"
40528,40529,Henry VIII,19.0,1.2.144,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Most like a careful subject, have collected"
40529,40530,Henry VIII,19.0,1.2.145,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Out of the Duke of Buckingham.
40530,40531,Henry VIII,20.0,1.2.146,KING HENRY VIII,Speak freely.
40531,40532,Henry VIII,21.0,1.2.147,Surveyor,"First, it was usual with him, every day"
40532,40533,Henry VIII,21.0,1.2.148,Surveyor,"It would infect his speech, that if the king"
40533,40534,Henry VIII,21.0,1.2.149,Surveyor,"Should without issue die, he'll carry it so"
40534,40535,Henry VIII,21.0,1.2.150,Surveyor,To make the sceptre his: these very words
40535,40536,Henry VIII,21.0,1.2.151,Surveyor,"I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,"
40536,40537,Henry VIII,21.0,1.2.152,Surveyor,"Lord Abergavenny, to whom by oath he menaced"
40537,40538,Henry VIII,21.0,1.2.153,Surveyor,Revenge upon the cardinal.
40538,40539,Henry VIII,22.0,1.2.154,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Please your highness, note"
40539,40540,Henry VIII,22.0,1.2.155,CARDINAL WOLSEY,This dangerous conception in this point.
40540,40541,Henry VIII,22.0,1.2.156,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Not friended by by his wish, to your high person"
40541,40542,Henry VIII,22.0,1.2.157,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"His will is most malignant, and it stretches"
40542,40543,Henry VIII,22.0,1.2.158,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Beyond you, to your friends."
40543,40544,Henry VIII,23.0,1.2.159,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My learn'd lord cardinal,"
40544,40545,Henry VIII,23.0,1.2.160,QUEEN KATHARINE,Deliver all with charity.
40545,40546,Henry VIII,24.0,1.2.161,KING HENRY VIII,Speak on:
40546,40547,Henry VIII,24.0,1.2.162,KING HENRY VIII,"How grounded he his title to the crown,"
40547,40548,Henry VIII,24.0,1.2.163,KING HENRY VIII,Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him
40548,40549,Henry VIII,24.0,1.2.164,KING HENRY VIII,At any time speak aught?
40549,40550,Henry VIII,25.0,1.2.165,Surveyor,He was brought to this
40550,40551,Henry VIII,25.0,1.2.166,Surveyor,By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.
40551,40552,Henry VIII,26.0,1.2.167,KING HENRY VIII,What was that Hopkins?
40552,40553,Henry VIII,27.0,1.2.168,Surveyor,"Sir, a Chartreux friar,"
40553,40554,Henry VIII,27.0,1.2.169,Surveyor,"His confessor, who fed him every minute"
40554,40555,Henry VIII,27.0,1.2.170,Surveyor,With words of sovereignty.
40555,40556,Henry VIII,28.0,1.2.171,KING HENRY VIII,How know'st thou this?
40556,40557,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.172,Surveyor,"Not long before your highness sped to France,"
40557,40558,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.173,Surveyor,"The duke being at the Rose, within the parish"
40558,40559,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.174,Surveyor,"Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand"
40559,40560,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.175,Surveyor,What was the speech among the Londoners
40560,40561,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.176,Surveyor,"Concerning the French journey: I replied,"
40561,40562,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.177,Surveyor,"Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,"
40562,40563,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.178,Surveyor,To the king's danger. Presently the duke
40563,40564,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.179,Surveyor,"Said, 'twas the fear, indeed, and that he doubted"
40564,40565,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.180,Surveyor,'Twould prove the verity of certain words
40565,40566,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.181,Surveyor,"Spoke by a holy monk, 'that oft,' says he,"
40566,40567,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.182,Surveyor,"'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit"
40567,40568,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.183,Surveyor,"John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour"
40568,40569,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.184,Surveyor,To hear from him a matter of some moment:
40569,40570,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.185,Surveyor,Whom after under the confession's seal
40570,40571,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.186,Surveyor,"He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke"
40571,40572,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.187,Surveyor,"My chaplain to no creature living, but"
40572,40573,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.188,Surveyor,"To me, should utter, with demure confidence"
40573,40574,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.189,Surveyor,"This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,"
40574,40575,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.190,Surveyor,"Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive"
40575,40576,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.191,Surveyor,To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke
40576,40577,Henry VIII,29.0,1.2.192,Surveyor,Shall govern England.'
40577,40578,Henry VIII,30.0,1.2.193,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If I know you well,"
40578,40579,Henry VIII,30.0,1.2.194,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office"
40579,40580,Henry VIII,30.0,1.2.195,QUEEN KATHARINE,On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
40580,40581,Henry VIII,30.0,1.2.196,QUEEN KATHARINE,You charge not in your spleen a noble person
40581,40582,Henry VIII,30.0,1.2.197,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed,"
40582,40583,Henry VIII,30.0,1.2.198,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Yes, heartily beseech you."
40583,40584,Henry VIII,31.0,1.2.199,KING HENRY VIII,Let him on.
40584,40585,Henry VIII,31.0,1.2.200,KING HENRY VIII,Go forward.
40585,40586,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.201,Surveyor,"On my soul, I'll speak but truth."
40586,40587,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.202,Surveyor,"I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions"
40587,40588,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.203,Surveyor,"The monk might be deceived, and that 'twas dangerous for him"
40588,40589,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.204,Surveyor,"To ruminate on this so far, until"
40589,40590,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.205,Surveyor,"It forged him some design, which, being believed,"
40590,40591,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.206,Surveyor,"It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,"
40591,40592,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.207,Surveyor,"It can do me no damage,' adding further,"
40592,40593,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.208,Surveyor,"That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,"
40593,40594,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.209,Surveyor,The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
40594,40595,Henry VIII,32.0,1.2.210,Surveyor,Should have gone off.
40595,40596,Henry VIII,33.0,1.2.211,KING HENRY VIII,"Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!"
40596,40597,Henry VIII,33.0,1.2.212,KING HENRY VIII,There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?
40597,40598,Henry VIII,34.0,1.2.213,Surveyor,"I can, my liege."
40598,40599,Henry VIII,35.0,1.2.214,KING HENRY VIII,Proceed.
40599,40600,Henry VIII,36.0,1.2.215,Surveyor,"Being at Greenwich,"
40600,40601,Henry VIII,36.0,1.2.216,Surveyor,After your highness had reproved the duke
40601,40602,Henry VIII,36.0,1.2.217,Surveyor,"About Sir William Blomer,--"
40602,40603,Henry VIII,37.0,1.2.218,KING HENRY VIII,I remember
40603,40604,Henry VIII,37.0,1.2.219,KING HENRY VIII,"Of such a time: being my sworn servant,"
40604,40605,Henry VIII,37.0,1.2.220,KING HENRY VIII,"The duke retain'd him his. But on, what hence?"
40605,40606,Henry VIII,38.0,1.2.221,Surveyor,"'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,"
40606,40607,Henry VIII,38.0,1.2.222,Surveyor,"As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd"
40607,40608,Henry VIII,38.0,1.2.223,Surveyor,The part my father meant to act upon
40608,40609,Henry VIII,38.0,1.2.224,Surveyor,"The usurper Richard, who, being at Salisbury,"
40609,40610,Henry VIII,38.0,1.2.225,Surveyor,"Made suit to come in's presence, which if granted,"
40610,40611,Henry VIII,38.0,1.2.226,Surveyor,"As he made semblance of his duty, would"
40611,40612,Henry VIII,38.0,1.2.227,Surveyor,Have put his knife to him.'
40612,40613,Henry VIII,39.0,1.2.228,KING HENRY VIII,A giant traitor!

40614,40615,Henry VIII,40.0,1.2.230,CARDINAL WOLSEY,and this man out of prison?
40615,40616,Henry VIII,41.0,1.2.231,QUEEN KATHARINE,God mend all!
40616,40617,Henry VIII,42.0,1.2.232,KING HENRY VIII,"There's something more would out of thee, what say'st?"
40617,40618,Henry VIII,43.0,1.2.233,Surveyor,"After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'"
40618,40619,Henry VIII,43.0,1.2.234,Surveyor,"He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,"
40619,40620,Henry VIII,43.0,1.2.235,Surveyor,"Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes"
40620,40621,Henry VIII,43.0,1.2.236,Surveyor,"He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenor"
40621,40622,Henry VIII,43.0,1.2.237,Surveyor,"Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo"

40815,40816,Henry VIII,28.0,1.4.87,Chamberlain,"But leave their flocks, and, under your fair conduct,"
40816,40817,Henry VIII,28.0,1.4.88,Chamberlain,Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
40817,40818,Henry VIII,28.0,1.4.89,Chamberlain,An hour of revels with 'em.
40818,40819,Henry VIII,29.0,1.4.90,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Say, lord chamberlain,"
40819,40820,Henry VIII,29.0,1.4.91,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"They have done my poor house grace, for which I pay 'em"
40820,40821,Henry VIII,29.0,1.4.92,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures."
40821,40822,Henry VIII,29.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,They choose Ladies for the dance. KING HENRY VIII chooses ANNE
40822,40823,Henry VIII,30.0,1.4.93,KING HENRY VIII,"The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,"
40823,40824,Henry VIII,30.0,1.4.94,KING HENRY VIII,Till now I never knew thee!
40824,40825,Henry VIII,30.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Music. Dance
40825,40826,Henry VIII,31.0,1.4.95,CARDINAL WOLSEY,My lord!
40826,40827,Henry VIII,32.0,1.4.96,Chamberlain,Your grace?
40827,40828,Henry VIII,33.0,1.4.97,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:"
40828,40829,Henry VIII,33.0,1.4.98,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,"
40829,40830,Henry VIII,33.0,1.4.99,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"More worthy this place than myself, to whom,"
40830,40831,Henry VIII,33.0,1.4.100,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"If I but knew him, with my love and duty"
40831,40832,Henry VIII,33.0,1.4.101,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I would surrender it.
40832,40833,Henry VIII,34.0,1.4.102,Chamberlain,"I will, my lord."
40833,40834,Henry VIII,34.0,,Chamberlain,Whispers the Masquers
40834,40835,Henry VIII,35.0,1.4.103,CARDINAL WOLSEY,What say they?
40835,40836,Henry VIII,36.0,1.4.104,Chamberlain,"Such a one, they all confess,"
40836,40837,Henry VIII,36.0,1.4.105,Chamberlain,"There is indeed, which they would have your grace"
40837,40838,Henry VIII,36.0,1.4.106,Chamberlain,"Find out, and he will take it."
40838,40839,Henry VIII,37.0,1.4.107,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let me see, then."
40839,40840,Henry VIII,37.0,1.4.108,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By all your good leaves, gentlemen, here I'll make"
40840,40841,Henry VIII,37.0,1.4.109,CARDINAL WOLSEY,My royal choice.
40841,40842,Henry VIII,38.0,1.4.110,KING HENRY VIII,"Ye have found him, cardinal:"
40842,40843,Henry VIII,38.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Unmasking
40843,40844,Henry VIII,38.0,1.4.111,KING HENRY VIII,"You hold a fair assembly, you do well, lord:"
40844,40845,Henry VIII,38.0,1.4.112,KING HENRY VIII,"You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,"
40845,40846,Henry VIII,38.0,1.4.113,KING HENRY VIII,I should judge now unhappily.
40846,40847,Henry VIII,39.0,1.4.114,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I am glad
40847,40848,Henry VIII,39.0,1.4.115,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Your grace is grown so pleasant.
40848,40849,Henry VIII,40.0,1.4.116,KING HENRY VIII,"My lord chamberlain,"
40849,40850,Henry VIII,40.0,1.4.117,KING HENRY VIII,"Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?"
40850,40851,Henry VIII,41.0,1.4.118,Chamberlain,"An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--"
40851,40852,Henry VIII,41.0,1.4.119,Chamberlain,"The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women."
40852,40853,Henry VIII,42.0,1.4.120,KING HENRY VIII,"By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,"
40853,40854,Henry VIII,42.0,1.4.121,KING HENRY VIII,"I were unmannerly, to take you out,"
40854,40855,Henry VIII,42.0,1.4.122,KING HENRY VIII,"And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!"
40855,40856,Henry VIII,42.0,1.4.123,KING HENRY VIII,Let it go round.
40856,40857,Henry VIII,43.0,1.4.124,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready"
40857,40858,Henry VIII,43.0,1.4.125,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I' the privy chamber?
40858,40859,Henry VIII,44.0,1.4.126,LOVELL,"Yes, my lord."
40859,40860,Henry VIII,45.0,1.4.127,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Your grace,"
40860,40861,Henry VIII,45.0,1.4.128,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I fear, with dancing is a little heated."
40861,40862,Henry VIII,46.0,1.4.129,KING HENRY VIII,"I fear, too much."
40862,40863,Henry VIII,47.0,1.4.130,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There's fresher air, my lord,"
40863,40864,Henry VIII,47.0,1.4.131,CARDINAL WOLSEY,In the next chamber.
40864,40865,Henry VIII,48.0,1.4.132,KING HENRY VIII,"Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,"
40865,40866,Henry VIII,48.0,1.4.133,KING HENRY VIII,I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry:
40866,40867,Henry VIII,48.0,1.4.134,KING HENRY VIII,"Good my lord cardinal, I have half a dozen healths"
40867,40868,Henry VIII,48.0,1.4.135,KING HENRY VIII,"To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure"
40868,40869,Henry VIII,48.0,1.4.136,KING HENRY VIII,"To lead 'em once again, and then let's dream"
40869,40870,Henry VIII,48.0,1.4.137,KING HENRY VIII,Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.
40870,40871,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Exeunt with trumpets
40871,40872,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,ACT II
40872,40873,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,SCENE I. Westminster. A street.
40873,40874,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,"Enter two Gentlemen, meeting"
40874,40875,Henry VIII,1.0,2.1.1,First Gentleman,Whither away so fast?
40875,40876,Henry VIII,2.0,2.1.2,Second Gentleman,"O, God save ye!"
40876,40877,Henry VIII,2.0,2.1.3,Second Gentleman,"Even to the hall, to hear what shall become"
40877,40878,Henry VIII,2.0,2.1.4,Second Gentleman,Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
40878,40879,Henry VIII,3.0,2.1.5,First Gentleman,I'll save you
40879,40880,Henry VIII,3.0,2.1.6,First Gentleman,"That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony"
40880,40881,Henry VIII,3.0,2.1.7,First Gentleman,Of bringing back the prisoner.
40881,40882,Henry VIII,4.0,2.1.8,Second Gentleman,Were you there?
40882,40883,Henry VIII,5.0,2.1.9,First Gentleman,"Yes, indeed, was I."
40883,40884,Henry VIII,6.0,2.1.10,Second Gentleman,"Pray, speak what has happen'd."
40884,40885,Henry VIII,7.0,2.1.11,First Gentleman,You may guess quickly what.
40885,40886,Henry VIII,8.0,2.1.12,Second Gentleman,Is he found guilty?
40886,40887,Henry VIII,9.0,2.1.13,First Gentleman,"Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't."
40887,40888,Henry VIII,10.0,2.1.14,Second Gentleman,I am sorry for't.
40888,40889,Henry VIII,11.0,2.1.15,First Gentleman,So are a number more.
40889,40890,Henry VIII,12.0,2.1.16,Second Gentleman,"But, pray, how pass'd it?"
40890,40891,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.17,First Gentleman,I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
40891,40892,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.18,First Gentleman,"Came to the bar, where to his accusations"
40892,40893,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.19,First Gentleman,He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
40893,40894,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.20,First Gentleman,Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
40894,40895,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.21,First Gentleman,The king's attorney on the contrary
40895,40896,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.22,First Gentleman,"Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions"
40896,40897,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.23,First Gentleman,"Of divers witnesses, which the duke desired"
40897,40898,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.24,First Gentleman,To have brought viva voce to his face:
40898,40899,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.25,First Gentleman,"At which appear'd against him his surveyor,"
40899,40900,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.26,First Gentleman,"Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,"
40900,40901,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.27,First Gentleman,"Confessor to him, with that devil-monk,"
40901,40902,Henry VIII,13.0,2.1.28,First Gentleman,"Hopkins, that made this mischief."
40902,40903,Henry VIII,14.0,2.1.29,Second Gentleman,That was he
40903,40904,Henry VIII,14.0,2.1.30,Second Gentleman,That fed him with his prophecies?
40904,40905,Henry VIII,15.0,2.1.31,First Gentleman,The same.
40905,40906,Henry VIII,15.0,2.1.32,First Gentleman,"All these accused him strongly, which he fain"
40906,40907,Henry VIII,15.0,2.1.33,First Gentleman,"Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:"
40907,40908,Henry VIII,15.0,2.1.34,First Gentleman,"And so his peers, upon this evidence,"
40908,40909,Henry VIII,15.0,2.1.35,First Gentleman,Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
40909,40910,Henry VIII,15.0,2.1.36,First Gentleman,"He spoke, and learnedly, for life, but all"
40910,40911,Henry VIII,15.0,2.1.37,First Gentleman,Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
40911,40912,Henry VIII,16.0,2.1.38,Second Gentleman,"After all this, how did he bear himself?"
40912,40913,Henry VIII,17.0,2.1.39,First Gentleman,"When he was brought again to the bar, to hear"
40913,40914,Henry VIII,17.0,2.1.40,First Gentleman,"His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd"
40914,40915,Henry VIII,17.0,2.1.41,First Gentleman,"With such an agony, he sweat extremely,"
40915,40916,Henry VIII,17.0,2.1.42,First Gentleman,"And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:"
40916,40917,Henry VIII,17.0,2.1.43,First Gentleman,"But he fell to himself again, and sweetly"
40917,40918,Henry VIII,17.0,2.1.44,First Gentleman,In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
40918,40919,Henry VIII,18.0,2.1.45,Second Gentleman,I do not think he fears death.
40919,40920,Henry VIII,19.0,2.1.46,First Gentleman,"Sure, he does not:"
40920,40921,Henry VIII,19.0,2.1.47,First Gentleman,"He never was so womanish, the cause"
40921,40922,Henry VIII,19.0,2.1.48,First Gentleman,He may a little grieve at.
40922,40923,Henry VIII,20.0,2.1.49,Second Gentleman,Certainly
40923,40924,Henry VIII,20.0,2.1.50,Second Gentleman,The cardinal is the end of this.
40924,40925,Henry VIII,21.0,2.1.51,First Gentleman,"'Tis likely,"
40925,40926,Henry VIII,21.0,2.1.52,First Gentleman,"By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,"
40926,40927,Henry VIII,21.0,2.1.53,First Gentleman,"Then deputy of Ireland, who removed,"
40927,40928,Henry VIII,21.0,2.1.54,First Gentleman,"Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,"
40928,40929,Henry VIII,21.0,2.1.55,First Gentleman,Lest he should help his father.
40929,40930,Henry VIII,22.0,2.1.56,Second Gentleman,That trick of state
40930,40931,Henry VIII,22.0,2.1.57,Second Gentleman,Was a deep envious one.
40931,40932,Henry VIII,23.0,2.1.58,First Gentleman,At his return
40932,40933,Henry VIII,23.0,2.1.59,First Gentleman,"No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,"
40933,40934,Henry VIII,23.0,2.1.60,First Gentleman,"And generally, whoever the king favours,"
40934,40935,Henry VIII,23.0,2.1.61,First Gentleman,"The cardinal instantly will find employment,"
40935,40936,Henry VIII,23.0,2.1.62,First Gentleman,And far enough from court too.
40936,40937,Henry VIII,24.0,2.1.63,Second Gentleman,All the commons
40937,40938,Henry VIII,24.0,2.1.64,Second Gentleman,"Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,"
40938,40939,Henry VIII,24.0,2.1.65,Second Gentleman,Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much
40939,40940,Henry VIII,24.0,2.1.66,Second Gentleman,"They love and dote on, call him bounteous Buckingham,"
40940,40941,Henry VIII,24.0,2.1.67,Second Gentleman,"The mirror of all courtesy,--"
40941,40942,Henry VIII,25.0,2.1.68,First Gentleman,"Stay there, sir,"
40942,40943,Henry VIII,25.0,2.1.69,First Gentleman,And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.
40943,40944,Henry VIII,25.0,2.1.69,First Gentleman,"Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment, tip-staves  before him, the axe with the edge towards him,  halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL, VAUX, SANDS, and common people"
40944,40945,Henry VIII,26.0,2.1.70,Second Gentleman,"Let's stand close, and behold him."
40945,40946,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.71,BUCKINGHAM,"All good people,"
40946,40947,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.72,BUCKINGHAM,"You that thus far have come to pity me,"
40947,40948,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.73,BUCKINGHAM,"Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me."
40948,40949,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.74,BUCKINGHAM,"I have this day received a traitor's judgment,"
40949,40950,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.75,BUCKINGHAM,"And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,"
40950,40951,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.76,BUCKINGHAM,"And if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,"
40951,40952,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.77,BUCKINGHAM,"Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!"
40952,40953,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.78,BUCKINGHAM,"The law I bear no malice for my death,"
40953,40954,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.79,BUCKINGHAM,"'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:"
40954,40955,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.80,BUCKINGHAM,But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
40955,40956,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.81,BUCKINGHAM,"Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:"
40956,40957,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.82,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,"
40957,40958,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.83,BUCKINGHAM,"Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,"
40958,40959,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.84,BUCKINGHAM,For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
40959,40960,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.85,BUCKINGHAM,"For further life in this world I ne'er hope,"
40960,40961,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.86,BUCKINGHAM,"Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies"
40961,40962,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.87,BUCKINGHAM,"More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,"
40962,40963,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.88,BUCKINGHAM,"And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,"
40963,40964,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.89,BUCKINGHAM,"His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave"
40964,40965,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.90,BUCKINGHAM,"Is only bitter to him, only dying,"
40965,40966,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.91,BUCKINGHAM,"Go with me, like good angels, to my end,"
40966,40967,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.92,BUCKINGHAM,"And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,"
40967,40968,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.93,BUCKINGHAM,"Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,"
40968,40969,Henry VIII,27.0,2.1.94,BUCKINGHAM,"And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name."
40969,40970,Henry VIII,28.0,2.1.95,LOVELL,"I do beseech your grace, for charity,"
40970,40971,Henry VIII,28.0,2.1.96,LOVELL,If ever any malice in your heart
40971,40972,Henry VIII,28.0,2.1.97,LOVELL,"Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly."
40972,40973,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.98,BUCKINGHAM,"Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you"
40973,40974,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.99,BUCKINGHAM,"As I would be forgiven: I forgive all,"
40974,40975,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.100,BUCKINGHAM,There cannot be those numberless offences
40975,40976,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.101,BUCKINGHAM,"'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:"
40976,40977,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.102,BUCKINGHAM,no black envy
40977,40978,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.103,BUCKINGHAM,"Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace,"
40978,40979,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.104,BUCKINGHAM,"And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him"
40979,40980,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.105,BUCKINGHAM,You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
40980,40981,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.106,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet are the king's, and, till my soul forsake,"
40981,40982,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.107,BUCKINGHAM,Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
40982,40983,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.108,BUCKINGHAM,Longer than I have time to tell his years!
40983,40984,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.109,BUCKINGHAM,Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!
40984,40985,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.110,BUCKINGHAM,"And when old time shall lead him to his end,"
40985,40986,Henry VIII,29.0,2.1.111,BUCKINGHAM,Goodness and he fill up one monument!
40986,40987,Henry VIII,30.0,2.1.112,LOVELL,"To the water side I must conduct your grace,"
40987,40988,Henry VIII,30.0,2.1.113,LOVELL,"Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,"
40988,40989,Henry VIII,30.0,2.1.114,LOVELL,Who undertakes you to your end.
40989,40990,Henry VIII,31.0,2.1.115,VAUX,"Prepare there,"
40990,40991,Henry VIII,31.0,2.1.116,VAUX,"The duke is coming: see the barge be ready,"
40991,40992,Henry VIII,31.0,2.1.117,VAUX,And fit it with such furniture as suits
40992,40993,Henry VIII,31.0,2.1.118,VAUX,The greatness of his person.
40993,40994,Henry VIII,32.0,2.1.119,BUCKINGHAM,"Nay, Sir Nicholas,"
40994,40995,Henry VIII,32.0,2.1.120,BUCKINGHAM,"Let it alone, my state now will but mock me."
40995,40996,Henry VIII,32.0,2.1.121,BUCKINGHAM,"When I came hither, I was lord high constable"
40996,40997,Henry VIII,32.0,2.1.122,BUCKINGHAM,"And Duke of Buckingham, now, poor Edward Bohun:"
40997,40998,Henry VIII,32.0,2.1.123,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet I am richer than my base accusers,"
40998,40999,Henry VIII,32.0,2.1.124,BUCKINGHAM,"That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it,"
40999,41000,Henry VIII,32.0,2.1.125,BUCKINGHAM,And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.

41188,41189,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.109,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,"
41189,41190,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.110,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Must now confess, if they have any goodness,"
41190,41191,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.111,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The trial just and noble. All the clerks,"
41191,41192,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.112,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms"
41192,41193,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.113,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,"
41193,41194,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.114,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Invited by your noble self, hath sent"
41194,41195,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.115,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"One general tongue unto us, this good man,"
41195,41196,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.116,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius,"
41196,41197,Henry VIII,31.0,2.2.117,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Whom once more I present unto your highness.
41197,41198,Henry VIII,32.0,2.2.118,KING HENRY VIII,"And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,"
41198,41199,Henry VIII,32.0,2.2.119,KING HENRY VIII,And thank the holy conclave for their loves:
41199,41200,Henry VIII,32.0,2.2.120,KING HENRY VIII,They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.
41200,41201,Henry VIII,33.0,2.2.121,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,"
41201,41202,Henry VIII,33.0,2.2.122,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,You are so noble. To your highness' hand
41202,41203,Henry VIII,33.0,2.2.123,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"I tender my commission, by whose virtue,"
41203,41204,Henry VIII,33.0,2.2.124,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord"
41204,41205,Henry VIII,33.0,2.2.125,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant"
41205,41206,Henry VIII,33.0,2.2.126,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,In the unpartial judging of this business.
41206,41207,Henry VIII,34.0,2.2.127,KING HENRY VIII,Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted
41207,41208,Henry VIII,34.0,2.2.128,KING HENRY VIII,Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?
41208,41209,Henry VIII,35.0,2.2.129,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I know your majesty has always loved her
41209,41210,Henry VIII,35.0,2.2.130,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So dear in heart, not to deny her that"
41210,41211,Henry VIII,35.0,2.2.131,CARDINAL WOLSEY,A woman of less place might ask by law:
41211,41212,Henry VIII,35.0,2.2.132,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.
41212,41213,Henry VIII,36.0,2.2.133,KING HENRY VIII,"Ay, and the best she shall have, and my favour"
41213,41214,Henry VIII,36.0,2.2.134,KING HENRY VIII,"To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,"
41214,41215,Henry VIII,36.0,2.2.135,KING HENRY VIII,"Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:"
41215,41216,Henry VIII,36.0,2.2.136,KING HENRY VIII,I find him a fit fellow.
41216,41217,Henry VIII,36.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY
41217,41218,Henry VIII,36.0,,KING HENRY VIII,"Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, with GARDINER"
41218,41219,Henry VIII,37.0,2.2.137,CARDINAL WOLSEY,[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand much joy and
41219,41220,Henry VIII,37.0,2.2.138,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"favour to you,"
41220,41221,Henry VIII,37.0,2.2.139,CARDINAL WOLSEY,You are the king's now.
41221,41222,Henry VIII,38.0,2.2.140,GARDINER,[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY]
41222,41223,Henry VIII,38.0,2.2.141,GARDINER,But to be commanded
41223,41224,Henry VIII,38.0,2.2.142,GARDINER,"For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me."
41224,41225,Henry VIII,39.0,2.2.143,KING HENRY VIII,"Come hither, Gardiner."
41225,41226,Henry VIII,39.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Walks and whispers
41226,41227,Henry VIII,40.0,2.2.144,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace"
41227,41228,Henry VIII,40.0,2.2.145,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,In this man's place before him?
41228,41229,Henry VIII,41.0,2.2.146,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Yes, he was."
41229,41230,Henry VIII,42.0,2.2.147,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,Was he not held a learned man?
41230,41231,Henry VIII,43.0,2.2.148,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Yes, surely."
41231,41232,Henry VIII,44.0,2.2.149,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then"
41232,41233,Henry VIII,44.0,2.2.150,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Even of yourself, lord cardinal."
41233,41234,Henry VIII,45.0,2.2.151,CARDINAL WOLSEY,How! of me?
41234,41235,Henry VIII,46.0,2.2.152,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"They will not stick to say you envied him,"
41235,41236,Henry VIII,46.0,2.2.153,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,"
41236,41237,Henry VIII,46.0,2.2.154,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Kept him a foreign man still, which so grieved him,"
41237,41238,Henry VIII,46.0,2.2.155,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,That he ran mad and died.
41238,41239,Henry VIII,47.0,2.2.156,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Heaven's peace be with him!
41239,41240,Henry VIII,47.0,2.2.157,CARDINAL WOLSEY,That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers
41240,41241,Henry VIII,47.0,2.2.158,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There's places of rebuke. He was a fool,"
41241,41242,Henry VIII,47.0,2.2.159,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,"
41242,41243,Henry VIII,47.0,2.2.160,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"If I command him, follows my appointment:"
41243,41244,Henry VIII,47.0,2.2.161,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,"
41244,41245,Henry VIII,47.0,2.2.162,CARDINAL WOLSEY,We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.
41245,41246,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.163,KING HENRY VIII,Deliver this with modesty to the queen.
41246,41247,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Exit GARDINER
41247,41248,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.164,KING HENRY VIII,The most convenient place that I can think of
41248,41249,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.165,KING HENRY VIII,"For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars,"
41249,41250,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.166,KING HENRY VIII,There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
41250,41251,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.167,KING HENRY VIII,"My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,"
41251,41252,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.168,KING HENRY VIII,Would it not grieve an able man to leave
41252,41253,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.169,KING HENRY VIII,"So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!"
41253,41254,Henry VIII,48.0,2.2.170,KING HENRY VIII,"O, 'tis a tender place, and I must leave her."
41254,41255,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Exeunt
41255,41256,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,SCENE III. An ante-chamber of the QUEEN'S apartments.
41256,41257,Henry VIII,48.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Enter ANNE and an Old Lady
41257,41258,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.1,ANNE,Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
41258,41259,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.2,ANNE,"His highness having lived so long with her, and she"
41259,41260,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.3,ANNE,So good a lady that no tongue could ever
41260,41261,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.4,ANNE,"Pronounce dishonour of her, by my life,"
41261,41262,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.5,ANNE,"She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after"
41262,41263,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.6,ANNE,"So many courses of the sun enthroned,"
41263,41264,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.7,ANNE,"Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which"
41264,41265,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.8,ANNE,To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
41265,41266,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.9,ANNE,"'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,"
41266,41267,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.10,ANNE,To give her the avaunt! it is a pity
41267,41268,Henry VIII,1.0,2.3.11,ANNE,Would move a monster.
41268,41269,Henry VIII,2.0,2.3.12,Old Lady,Hearts of most hard temper
41269,41270,Henry VIII,2.0,2.3.13,Old Lady,Melt and lament for her.
41270,41271,Henry VIII,3.0,2.3.14,ANNE,"O, God's will! much better"
41271,41272,Henry VIII,3.0,2.3.15,ANNE,"She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,"
41272,41273,Henry VIII,3.0,2.3.16,ANNE,"Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce"
41273,41274,Henry VIII,3.0,2.3.17,ANNE,"It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging"
41274,41275,Henry VIII,3.0,2.3.18,ANNE,As soul and body's severing.
41275,41276,Henry VIII,4.0,2.3.19,Old Lady,"Alas, poor lady!"
41276,41277,Henry VIII,4.0,2.3.20,Old Lady,She's a stranger now again.
41277,41278,Henry VIII,5.0,2.3.21,ANNE,So much the more
41278,41279,Henry VIII,5.0,2.3.22,ANNE,"Must pity drop upon her. Verily,"
41279,41280,Henry VIII,5.0,2.3.23,ANNE,"I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,"
41280,41281,Henry VIII,5.0,2.3.24,ANNE,"And range with humble livers in content,"
41281,41282,Henry VIII,5.0,2.3.25,ANNE,"Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,"
41282,41283,Henry VIII,5.0,2.3.26,ANNE,And wear a golden sorrow.
41283,41284,Henry VIII,6.0,2.3.27,Old Lady,Our content
41284,41285,Henry VIII,6.0,2.3.28,Old Lady,Is our best having.
41285,41286,Henry VIII,7.0,2.3.29,ANNE,"By my troth and maidenhead,"
41286,41287,Henry VIII,7.0,2.3.30,ANNE,I would not be a queen.
41287,41288,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.31,Old Lady,"Beshrew me, I would,"
41288,41289,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.32,Old Lady,"And venture maidenhead for't, and so would you,"
41289,41290,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.33,Old Lady,For all this spice of your hypocrisy:
41290,41291,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.34,Old Lady,"You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,"
41291,41292,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.35,Old Lady,"Have too a woman's heart, which ever yet"
41292,41293,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.36,Old Lady,"Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty,"
41293,41294,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.37,Old Lady,"Which, to say sooth, are blessings, and which gifts,"
41294,41295,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.38,Old Lady,"Saving your mincing, the capacity"
41295,41296,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.39,Old Lady,"Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,"
41296,41297,Henry VIII,8.0,2.3.40,Old Lady,If you might please to stretch it.
41297,41298,Henry VIII,9.0,2.3.41,ANNE,"Nay, good troth."
41298,41299,Henry VIII,10.0,2.3.42,Old Lady,"Yes, troth, and troth, you would not be a queen?"
41299,41300,Henry VIII,11.0,2.3.43,ANNE,"No, not for all the riches under heaven."
41300,41301,Henry VIII,11.0,2.3.44,ANNE,"Old Lady:	'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,"
41301,41302,Henry VIII,11.0,2.3.45,ANNE,"Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,"
41302,41303,Henry VIII,11.0,2.3.46,ANNE,What think you of a duchess? have you limbs
41303,41304,Henry VIII,11.0,2.3.47,ANNE,To bear that load of title?
41304,41305,Henry VIII,12.0,2.3.48,ANNE,"No, in truth."
41305,41306,Henry VIII,13.0,2.3.49,Old Lady,"Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little,"
41306,41307,Henry VIII,13.0,2.3.50,Old Lady,"I would not be a young count in your way,"
41307,41308,Henry VIII,13.0,2.3.51,Old Lady,For more than blushing comes to: if your back
41308,41309,Henry VIII,13.0,2.3.52,Old Lady,"Cannot vouchsafe this burthen,'tis too weak"
41309,41310,Henry VIII,13.0,2.3.53,Old Lady,Ever to get a boy.
41310,41311,Henry VIII,14.0,2.3.54,ANNE,How you do talk!
41311,41312,Henry VIII,14.0,2.3.55,ANNE,"I swear again, I would not be a queen"
41312,41313,Henry VIII,14.0,2.3.56,ANNE,For all the world.
41313,41314,Henry VIII,15.0,2.3.57,Old Lady,"In faith, for little England"
41314,41315,Henry VIII,15.0,2.3.58,Old Lady,You'ld venture an emballing: I myself
41315,41316,Henry VIII,15.0,2.3.59,Old Lady,"Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd"
41316,41317,Henry VIII,15.0,2.3.60,Old Lady,"No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?"
41317,41318,Henry VIII,15.0,,Old Lady,Enter Chamberlain
41318,41319,Henry VIII,16.0,2.3.61,Chamberlain,"Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know"
41319,41320,Henry VIII,16.0,2.3.62,Chamberlain,The secret of your conference?
41320,41321,Henry VIII,17.0,2.3.63,ANNE,"My good lord,"
41321,41322,Henry VIII,17.0,2.3.64,ANNE,"Not your demand, it values not your asking:"
41322,41323,Henry VIII,17.0,2.3.65,ANNE,Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.
41323,41324,Henry VIII,18.0,2.3.66,Chamberlain,"It was a gentle business, and becoming"
41324,41325,Henry VIII,18.0,2.3.67,Chamberlain,The action of good women: there is hope
41325,41326,Henry VIII,18.0,2.3.68,Chamberlain,All will be well.
41326,41327,Henry VIII,19.0,2.3.69,ANNE,"Now, I pray God, amen!"
41327,41328,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.70,Chamberlain,"You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings"
41328,41329,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.71,Chamberlain,"Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,"
41329,41330,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.72,Chamberlain,"Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's"
41330,41331,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.73,Chamberlain,"Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty"
41331,41332,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.74,Chamberlain,"Commends his good opinion of you, and"
41332,41333,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.75,Chamberlain,Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
41333,41334,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.76,Chamberlain,Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title
41334,41335,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.77,Chamberlain,"A thousand pound a year, annual support,"
41335,41336,Henry VIII,20.0,2.3.78,Chamberlain,Out of his grace he adds.
41336,41337,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.79,ANNE,I do not know
41337,41338,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.80,ANNE,"What kind of my obedience I should tender,"
41338,41339,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.81,ANNE,More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
41339,41340,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.82,ANNE,"Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes"
41340,41341,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.83,ANNE,"More worth than empty vanities, yet prayers and wishes"
41341,41342,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.84,ANNE,"Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,"
41342,41343,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.85,ANNE,"Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,"
41343,41344,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.86,ANNE,"As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness,"
41344,41345,Henry VIII,21.0,2.3.87,ANNE,Whose health and royalty I pray for.
41345,41346,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.88,Chamberlain,"Lady,"
41346,41347,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.89,Chamberlain,I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
41347,41348,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.90,Chamberlain,The king hath of you.
41348,41349,Henry VIII,22.0,,Chamberlain,Aside
41349,41350,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.91,Chamberlain,"I have perused her well,"
41350,41351,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.92,Chamberlain,Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
41351,41352,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.93,Chamberlain,That they have caught the king: and who knows yet
41352,41353,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.94,Chamberlain,But from this lady may proceed a gem
41353,41354,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.95,Chamberlain,"To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,"
41354,41355,Henry VIII,22.0,2.3.96,Chamberlain,And say I spoke with you.
41355,41356,Henry VIII,22.0,,Chamberlain,Exit Chamberlain
41356,41357,Henry VIII,23.0,2.3.97,ANNE,My honour'd lord.
41357,41358,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.98,Old Lady,"Why, this it is, see, see!"
41358,41359,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.99,Old Lady,"I have been begging sixteen years in court,"
41359,41360,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.100,Old Lady,"Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could"
41360,41361,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.101,Old Lady,Come pat betwixt too early and too late
41361,41362,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.102,Old Lady,"For any suit of pounds, and you, O fate!"
41362,41363,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.103,Old Lady,"A very fresh-fish here--fie, fie, fie upon"
41363,41364,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.104,Old Lady,This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up
41364,41365,Henry VIII,24.0,2.3.105,Old Lady,Before you open it.
41365,41366,Henry VIII,25.0,2.3.106,ANNE,This is strange to me.
41366,41367,Henry VIII,26.0,2.3.107,Old Lady,"How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no."
41367,41368,Henry VIII,26.0,2.3.108,Old Lady,"There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,"
41368,41369,Henry VIII,26.0,2.3.109,Old Lady,"That would not be a queen, that would she not,"
41369,41370,Henry VIII,26.0,2.3.110,Old Lady,For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?
41370,41371,Henry VIII,27.0,2.3.111,ANNE,"Come, you are pleasant."
41371,41372,Henry VIII,28.0,2.3.112,Old Lady,"With your theme, I could"
41372,41373,Henry VIII,28.0,2.3.113,Old Lady,O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!

41593,41594,Henry VIII,26.0,2.4.200,KING HENRY VIII,"I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had"

41604,41605,Henry VIII,26.0,2.4.211,KING HENRY VIII,"By this my issue's fail, and that gave to me"
41605,41606,Henry VIII,26.0,2.4.212,KING HENRY VIII,Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in

41615,41616,Henry VIII,26.0,2.4.222,KING HENRY VIII,When I first moved you.
41616,41617,Henry VIII,27.0,2.4.223,LINCOLN,"Very well, my liege."
41617,41618,Henry VIII,28.0,2.4.224,KING HENRY VIII,I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say
41618,41619,Henry VIII,28.0,2.4.225,KING HENRY VIII,How far you satisfied me.
41619,41620,Henry VIII,29.0,2.4.226,LINCOLN,"So please your highness,"

41626,41627,Henry VIII,30.0,2.4.233,KING HENRY VIII,"I then moved you,"
41627,41628,Henry VIII,30.0,2.4.234,KING HENRY VIII,"My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave"
41628,41629,Henry VIII,30.0,2.4.235,KING HENRY VIII,To make this present summons: unsolicited

41649,41650,Henry VIII,32.0,2.4.256,KING HENRY VIII,"My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,"

41727,41728,Henry VIII,13.0,3.1.67,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Like free and honest men, our just opinions"
41728,41729,Henry VIII,13.0,3.1.68,CARDINAL WOLSEY,And comforts to your cause.
41729,41730,Henry VIII,14.0,3.1.69,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Most honour'd madam,"
41730,41731,Henry VIII,14.0,3.1.70,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,"
41731,41732,Henry VIII,14.0,3.1.71,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,"
41732,41733,Henry VIII,14.0,3.1.72,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Forgetting, like a good man your late censure"
41733,41734,Henry VIII,14.0,3.1.73,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Both of his truth and him, which was too far,"
41734,41735,Henry VIII,14.0,3.1.74,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,"
41735,41736,Henry VIII,14.0,3.1.75,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,His service and his counsel.
41736,41737,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.76,QUEEN KATHARINE,[Aside]	To betray me.--
41737,41738,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.77,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My lords, I thank you both for your good wills,"
41738,41739,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.78,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ye speak like honest men, pray God, ye prove so!"
41739,41740,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.79,QUEEN KATHARINE,"But how to make ye suddenly an answer,"
41740,41741,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.80,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--"
41741,41742,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.81,QUEEN KATHARINE,"More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,"
41742,41743,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.82,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And to such men of gravity and learning,"
41743,41744,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.83,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In truth, I know not. I was set at work"
41744,41745,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.84,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking"
41745,41746,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.85,QUEEN KATHARINE,Either for such men or such business.
41746,41747,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.86,QUEEN KATHARINE,"For her sake that I have been,--for I feel"
41747,41748,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.87,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,"
41748,41749,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.88,QUEEN KATHARINE,Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
41749,41750,Henry VIII,15.0,3.1.89,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!"
41750,41751,Henry VIII,16.0,3.1.90,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:"
41751,41752,Henry VIII,16.0,3.1.91,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Your hopes and friends are infinite.
41752,41753,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.92,QUEEN KATHARINE,In England
41753,41754,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.93,QUEEN KATHARINE,"But little for my profit: can you think, lords,"
41754,41755,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.94,QUEEN KATHARINE,That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
41755,41756,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.95,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,"
41756,41757,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.96,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,"
41757,41758,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.97,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,"
41758,41759,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.98,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They that must weigh out my afflictions,"
41759,41760,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.99,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They that my trust must grow to, live not here:"
41760,41761,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.100,QUEEN KATHARINE,"They are, as all my other comforts, far hence"
41761,41762,Henry VIII,17.0,3.1.101,QUEEN KATHARINE,"In mine own country, lords."
41762,41763,Henry VIII,18.0,3.1.102,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,I would your grace
41763,41764,Henry VIII,18.0,3.1.103,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel."
41764,41765,Henry VIII,19.0,3.1.104,QUEEN KATHARINE,"How, sir?"
41765,41766,Henry VIII,20.0,3.1.105,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Put your main cause into the king's protection,"
41766,41767,Henry VIII,20.0,3.1.106,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
41767,41768,Henry VIII,20.0,3.1.107,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Both for your honour better and your cause,"
41768,41769,Henry VIII,20.0,3.1.108,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,"
41769,41770,Henry VIII,20.0,3.1.109,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,You'll part away disgraced.
41770,41771,Henry VIII,21.0,3.1.110,CARDINAL WOLSEY,He tells you rightly.
41771,41772,Henry VIII,22.0,3.1.111,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:"
41772,41773,Henry VIII,22.0,3.1.112,QUEEN KATHARINE,Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
41773,41774,Henry VIII,22.0,3.1.113,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Heaven is above all yet, there sits a judge"
41774,41775,Henry VIII,22.0,3.1.114,QUEEN KATHARINE,That no king can corrupt.
41775,41776,Henry VIII,23.0,3.1.115,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,Your rage mistakes us.
41776,41777,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.116,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,"
41777,41778,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.117,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues,"
41778,41779,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.118,QUEEN KATHARINE,But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:
41779,41780,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.119,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?"
41780,41781,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.120,QUEEN KATHARINE,"The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,"
41781,41782,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.121,QUEEN KATHARINE,"A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?"
41782,41783,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.122,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I will not wish ye half my miseries,"
41783,41784,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.123,QUEEN KATHARINE,"I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye,"
41784,41785,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.124,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once"
41785,41786,Henry VIII,24.0,3.1.125,QUEEN KATHARINE,The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.
41786,41787,Henry VIII,25.0,3.1.126,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Madam, this is a mere distraction,"
41787,41788,Henry VIII,25.0,3.1.127,CARDINAL WOLSEY,You turn the good we offer into envy.
41788,41789,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.128,QUEEN KATHARINE,Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye
41789,41790,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.129,QUEEN KATHARINE,And all such false professors! would you have me--
41790,41791,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.130,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If you have any justice, any pity,"
41791,41792,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.131,QUEEN KATHARINE,If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--
41792,41793,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.132,QUEEN KATHARINE,Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
41793,41794,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.133,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,"
41794,41795,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.134,QUEEN KATHARINE,"His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,"
41795,41796,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.135,QUEEN KATHARINE,And all the fellowship I hold now with him
41796,41797,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.136,QUEEN KATHARINE,Is only my obedience. What can happen
41797,41798,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.137,QUEEN KATHARINE,To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
41798,41799,Henry VIII,26.0,3.1.138,QUEEN KATHARINE,Make me a curse like this.
41799,41800,Henry VIII,27.0,3.1.139,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,Your fears are worse.
41800,41801,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.140,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,"
41801,41802,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.141,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?"
41802,41803,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.142,QUEEN KATHARINE,"A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,"
41803,41804,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.143,QUEEN KATHARINE,Never yet branded with suspicion?
41804,41805,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.144,QUEEN KATHARINE,Have I with all my full affections
41805,41806,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.145,QUEEN KATHARINE,Still met the king? loved him next heaven?
41806,41807,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.146,QUEEN KATHARINE,obey'd him?
41807,41808,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.147,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?"
41808,41809,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.148,QUEEN KATHARINE,Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
41809,41810,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.149,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords."
41810,41811,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.150,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Bring me a constant woman to her husband,"
41811,41812,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.151,QUEEN KATHARINE,"One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure,"
41812,41813,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.152,QUEEN KATHARINE,"And to that woman, when she has done most,"
41813,41814,Henry VIII,28.0,3.1.153,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Yet will I add an honour, a great patience."
41814,41815,Henry VIII,29.0,3.1.154,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Madam, you wander from the good we aim at."
41815,41816,Henry VIII,30.0,3.1.155,QUEEN KATHARINE,"My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,"
41816,41817,Henry VIII,30.0,3.1.156,QUEEN KATHARINE,To give up willingly that noble title
41817,41818,Henry VIII,30.0,3.1.157,QUEEN KATHARINE,Your master wed me to: nothing but death
41818,41819,Henry VIII,30.0,3.1.158,QUEEN KATHARINE,Shall e'er divorce my dignities.
41819,41820,Henry VIII,31.0,3.1.159,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Pray, hear me."
41820,41821,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.160,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Would I had never trod this English earth,"
41821,41822,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.161,QUEEN KATHARINE,Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
41822,41823,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.162,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts."
41823,41824,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.163,QUEEN KATHARINE,"What will become of me now, wretched lady!"
41824,41825,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.164,QUEEN KATHARINE,I am the most unhappy woman living.
41825,41826,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.165,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!"
41826,41827,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.166,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,"
41827,41828,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.167,QUEEN KATHARINE,"No friend, no hope, no kindred weep for me,"
41828,41829,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.168,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,"
41829,41830,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.169,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,"
41830,41831,Henry VIII,32.0,3.1.170,QUEEN KATHARINE,I'll hang my head and perish.
41831,41832,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.171,CARDINAL WOLSEY,If your grace
41832,41833,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.172,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,"
41833,41834,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.173,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,"
41834,41835,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.174,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,"
41835,41836,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.175,CARDINAL WOLSEY,The way of our profession is against it:
41836,41837,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.176,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em."
41837,41838,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.177,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For goodness' sake, consider what you do,"
41838,41839,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.178,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly"
41839,41840,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.179,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage."
41840,41841,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.180,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The hearts of princes kiss obedience,"
41841,41842,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.181,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"So much they love it, but to stubborn spirits"
41842,41843,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.182,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"They swell, and grow as terrible as storms."
41843,41844,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.183,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know you have a gentle, noble temper,"
41844,41845,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.184,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us"
41845,41846,Henry VIII,33.0,3.1.185,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants."
41846,41847,Henry VIII,34.0,3.1.186,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues"
41847,41848,Henry VIII,34.0,3.1.187,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,"
41848,41849,Henry VIII,34.0,3.1.188,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"As yours was put into you, ever casts"
41849,41850,Henry VIII,34.0,3.1.189,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you,"
41850,41851,Henry VIII,34.0,3.1.190,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please"
41851,41852,Henry VIII,34.0,3.1.191,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,"To trust us in your business, we are ready"
41852,41853,Henry VIII,34.0,3.1.192,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,To use our utmost  studies in your service.
41853,41854,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.193,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,"
41854,41855,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.194,QUEEN KATHARINE,"If I have used myself unmannerly,"
41855,41856,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.195,QUEEN KATHARINE,"You know I am a woman, lacking wit"
41856,41857,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.196,QUEEN KATHARINE,To make a seemly answer to such persons.
41857,41858,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.197,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Pray, do my service to his majesty:"
41858,41859,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.198,QUEEN KATHARINE,"He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers"
41859,41860,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.199,QUEEN KATHARINE,"While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,"
41860,41861,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.200,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,"
41861,41862,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.201,QUEEN KATHARINE,"That little thought, when she set footing here,"
41862,41863,Henry VIII,35.0,3.1.202,QUEEN KATHARINE,She should have bought her dignities so dear.
41863,41864,Henry VIII,35.0,,QUEEN KATHARINE,Exeunt
41864,41865,Henry VIII,35.0,,QUEEN KATHARINE,SCENE II. Ante-chamber to KING HENRY VIII's apartment.
41865,41866,Henry VIII,35.0,,QUEEN KATHARINE,"Enter NORFOLK, SUFFOLK, SURREY, and Chamberlain"
41866,41867,Henry VIII,1.0,3.2.1,NORFOLK,"If you will now unite in your complaints,"
41867,41868,Henry VIII,1.0,3.2.2,NORFOLK,"And force them with a constancy, the cardinal"
41868,41869,Henry VIII,1.0,3.2.3,NORFOLK,Cannot stand under them: if you omit
41869,41870,Henry VIII,1.0,3.2.4,NORFOLK,"The offer of this time, I cannot promise"
41870,41871,Henry VIII,1.0,3.2.5,NORFOLK,"But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,"
41871,41872,Henry VIII,1.0,3.2.6,NORFOLK,With these you bear already.
41872,41873,Henry VIII,2.0,3.2.7,SURREY,I am joyful
41873,41874,Henry VIII,2.0,3.2.8,SURREY,To meet the least occasion that may give me
41874,41875,Henry VIII,2.0,3.2.9,SURREY,"Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,"
41875,41876,Henry VIII,2.0,3.2.10,SURREY,To be revenged on him.
41876,41877,Henry VIII,3.0,3.2.11,SUFFOLK,Which of the peers
41877,41878,Henry VIII,3.0,3.2.12,SUFFOLK,"Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least"
41878,41879,Henry VIII,3.0,3.2.13,SUFFOLK,Strangely neglected? when did he regard
41879,41880,Henry VIII,3.0,3.2.14,SUFFOLK,The stamp of nobleness in any person
41880,41881,Henry VIII,3.0,3.2.15,SUFFOLK,Out of himself?
41881,41882,Henry VIII,4.0,3.2.16,Chamberlain,"My lords, you speak your pleasures:"
41882,41883,Henry VIII,4.0,3.2.17,Chamberlain,"What he deserves of you and me I know,"
41883,41884,Henry VIII,4.0,3.2.18,Chamberlain,"What we can do to him, though now the time"
41884,41885,Henry VIII,4.0,3.2.19,Chamberlain,"Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot"
41885,41886,Henry VIII,4.0,3.2.20,Chamberlain,"Bar his access to the king, never attempt"
41886,41887,Henry VIII,4.0,3.2.21,Chamberlain,"Any thing on him, for he hath a witchcraft"
41887,41888,Henry VIII,4.0,3.2.22,Chamberlain,Over the king in's tongue.
41888,41889,Henry VIII,5.0,3.2.23,NORFOLK,"O, fear him not,"
41889,41890,Henry VIII,5.0,3.2.24,NORFOLK,His spell in that is out: the king hath found
41890,41891,Henry VIII,5.0,3.2.25,NORFOLK,Matter against him that for ever mars
41891,41892,Henry VIII,5.0,3.2.26,NORFOLK,"The honey of his language. No, he's settled,"
41892,41893,Henry VIII,5.0,3.2.27,NORFOLK,"Not to come off, in his displeasure."
41893,41894,Henry VIII,6.0,3.2.28,SURREY,"Sir,"
41894,41895,Henry VIII,6.0,3.2.29,SURREY,I should be glad to hear such news as this
41895,41896,Henry VIII,6.0,3.2.30,SURREY,Once every hour.
41896,41897,Henry VIII,7.0,3.2.31,NORFOLK,"Believe it, this is true:"
41897,41898,Henry VIII,7.0,3.2.32,NORFOLK,In the divorce his contrary proceedings
41898,41899,Henry VIII,7.0,3.2.33,NORFOLK,Are all unfolded wherein he appears
41899,41900,Henry VIII,7.0,3.2.34,NORFOLK,As I would wish mine enemy.
41900,41901,Henry VIII,8.0,3.2.35,SURREY,How came

42086,42087,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.216,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends
42087,42088,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.217,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
42088,42089,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.218,CARDINAL WOLSEY,To the good of your most sacred person and
42089,42090,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.219,CARDINAL WOLSEY,The profit of the state. For your great graces
42090,42091,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.220,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I"
42091,42092,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.221,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,"
42092,42093,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.222,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,"
42093,42094,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.223,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Which ever has and ever shall be growing,"
42094,42095,Henry VIII,61.0,3.2.224,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Till death, that winter, kill it."
42095,42096,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.225,KING HENRY VIII,"Fairly answer'd,"
42096,42097,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.226,KING HENRY VIII,A loyal and obedient subject is
42097,42098,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.227,KING HENRY VIII,Therein illustrated: the honour of it
42098,42099,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.228,KING HENRY VIII,"Does pay the act of it, as, i' the contrary,"
42099,42100,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.229,KING HENRY VIII,The foulness is the punishment. I presume
42100,42101,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.230,KING HENRY VIII,"That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,"
42101,42102,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.231,KING HENRY VIII,"My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more"
42102,42103,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.232,KING HENRY VIII,"On you than any, so your hand and heart,"
42103,42104,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.233,KING HENRY VIII,"Your brain, and every function of your power,"
42104,42105,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.234,KING HENRY VIII,"Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,"
42105,42106,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.235,KING HENRY VIII,"As 'twere in love's particular, be more"
42106,42107,Henry VIII,62.0,3.2.236,KING HENRY VIII,"To me, your friend, than any."
42107,42108,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.237,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I do profess
42108,42109,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.238,CARDINAL WOLSEY,That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
42109,42110,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.239,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"More than mine own, that am, have, and will be--"
42110,42111,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.240,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Though all the world should crack their duty to you,"
42111,42112,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.241,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And throw it from their soul, though perils did"
42112,42113,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.242,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and"
42113,42114,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.243,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,"
42114,42115,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.244,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"As doth a rock against the chiding flood,"
42115,42116,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.245,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Should the approach of this wild river break,"
42116,42117,Henry VIII,63.0,3.2.246,CARDINAL WOLSEY,And stand unshaken yours.
42117,42118,Henry VIII,64.0,3.2.247,KING HENRY VIII,'Tis nobly spoken:
42118,42119,Henry VIII,64.0,3.2.248,KING HENRY VIII,"Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,"
42119,42120,Henry VIII,64.0,3.2.249,KING HENRY VIII,"For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this,"
42120,42121,Henry VIII,64.0,,KING HENRY VIII,Giving him papers
42121,42122,Henry VIII,64.0,3.2.250,KING HENRY VIII,"And after, this: and then to breakfast with"
42122,42123,Henry VIII,64.0,3.2.251,KING HENRY VIII,What appetite you have.
42123,42124,Henry VIII,64.0,3.2.251,KING HENRY VIII,"Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY: the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering"
42124,42125,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.252,CARDINAL WOLSEY,What should this mean?
42125,42126,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.253,CARDINAL WOLSEY,What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
42126,42127,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.254,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"He parted frowning from me, as if ruin"
42127,42128,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.255,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
42128,42129,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.256,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him,"
42129,42130,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.257,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper,"
42130,42131,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.258,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so,"
42131,42132,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.259,CARDINAL WOLSEY,This paper has undone me: 'tis the account
42132,42133,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.260,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
42133,42134,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.261,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For mine own ends, indeed, to gain the popedom,"
42134,42135,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.262,CARDINAL WOLSEY,And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
42135,42136,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.263,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
42136,42137,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.264,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Made me put this main secret in the packet
42137,42138,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.265,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
42138,42139,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.266,CARDINAL WOLSEY,No new device to beat this from his brains?
42139,42140,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.267,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know 'twill stir him strongly, yet I know"
42140,42141,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.268,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune"
42141,42142,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.269,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'
42142,42143,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.270,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The letter, as I live, with all the business"
42143,42144,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.271,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!"
42144,42145,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.272,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,"
42145,42146,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.273,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And, from that full meridian of my glory,"
42146,42147,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.274,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
42147,42148,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.275,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Like a bright exhalation m the evening,"
42148,42149,Henry VIII,65.0,3.2.276,CARDINAL WOLSEY,And no man see me more.
42149,42150,Henry VIII,65.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY, and the Chamberlain"
42150,42151,Henry VIII,66.0,3.2.277,NORFOLK,"Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you"
42151,42152,Henry VIII,66.0,3.2.278,NORFOLK,To render up the great seal presently
42152,42153,Henry VIII,66.0,3.2.279,NORFOLK,"Into our hands, and to confine yourself"
42153,42154,Henry VIII,66.0,3.2.280,NORFOLK,"To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,"
42154,42155,Henry VIII,66.0,3.2.281,NORFOLK,Till you hear further from his highness.
42155,42156,Henry VIII,67.0,3.2.282,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Stay:
42156,42157,Henry VIII,67.0,3.2.283,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry"
42157,42158,Henry VIII,67.0,3.2.284,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Authority so weighty.
42158,42159,Henry VIII,68.0,3.2.285,SUFFOLK,"Who dare cross 'em,"
42159,42160,Henry VIII,68.0,3.2.286,SUFFOLK,Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?
42160,42161,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.287,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Till I find more than will or words to do it,"
42161,42162,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.288,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I mean your malice, know, officious lords,"
42162,42163,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.289,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
42163,42164,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.290,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:"
42164,42165,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.291,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,"
42165,42166,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.292,CARDINAL WOLSEY,As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton
42166,42167,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.293,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
42167,42168,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.294,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Follow your envious courses, men of malice,"
42168,42169,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.295,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,"
42169,42170,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.296,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,"
42170,42171,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.297,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You ask with such a violence, the king,"
42171,42172,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.298,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me,"
42172,42173,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.299,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,"
42173,42174,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.300,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"During my life, and, to confirm his goodness,"
42174,42175,Henry VIII,69.0,3.2.301,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?"
42175,42176,Henry VIII,70.0,3.2.302,SURREY,"The king, that gave it."
42176,42177,Henry VIII,71.0,3.2.303,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"It must be himself, then."
42177,42178,Henry VIII,72.0,3.2.304,SURREY,"Thou art a proud traitor, priest."
42178,42179,Henry VIII,73.0,3.2.305,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Proud lord, thou liest:"
42179,42180,Henry VIII,73.0,3.2.306,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
42180,42181,Henry VIII,73.0,3.2.307,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Have burnt that tongue than said so.
42181,42182,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.308,SURREY,"Thy ambition,"
42182,42183,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.309,SURREY,"Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land"
42183,42184,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.310,SURREY,"Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:"
42184,42185,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.311,SURREY,"The heads of all thy brother cardinals,"
42185,42186,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.312,SURREY,"With thee and all thy best parts bound together,"
42186,42187,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.313,SURREY,Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
42187,42188,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.314,SURREY,"You sent me deputy for Ireland,"
42188,42189,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.315,SURREY,"Far from his succor, from the king, from all"
42189,42190,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.316,SURREY,"That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him,"
42190,42191,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.317,SURREY,"Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,"
42191,42192,Henry VIII,74.0,3.2.318,SURREY,Absolved him with an axe.
42192,42193,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.319,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This, and all else"
42193,42194,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.320,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This talking lord can lay upon my credit,"
42194,42195,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.321,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I answer is most false. The duke by law
42195,42196,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.322,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Found his deserts: how innocent I was
42196,42197,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.323,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"From any private malice in his end,"
42197,42198,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.324,CARDINAL WOLSEY,His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
42198,42199,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.325,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you"
42199,42200,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.326,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"You have as little honesty as honour,"
42200,42201,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.327,CARDINAL WOLSEY,That in the way of loyalty and truth

42202,42203,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.329,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,"
42203,42204,Henry VIII,75.0,3.2.330,CARDINAL WOLSEY,And all that love his follies.
42204,42205,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.331,SURREY,"By my soul,"
42205,42206,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.332,SURREY,"Your long coat, priest, protects you, thou"
42206,42207,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.333,SURREY,shouldst feel
42207,42208,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.334,SURREY,"My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,"
42208,42209,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.335,SURREY,Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
42209,42210,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.336,SURREY,"And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,"
42210,42211,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.337,SURREY,"To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,"
42211,42212,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.338,SURREY,"Farewell nobility, let his grace go forward,"
42212,42213,Henry VIII,76.0,3.2.339,SURREY,And dare us with his cap like larks.
42213,42214,Henry VIII,77.0,3.2.340,CARDINAL WOLSEY,All goodness
42214,42215,Henry VIII,77.0,3.2.341,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Is poison to thy stomach.
42215,42216,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.342,SURREY,"Yes, that goodness"
42216,42217,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.343,SURREY,"Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,"
42217,42218,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.344,SURREY,"Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion,"
42218,42219,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.345,SURREY,The goodness of your intercepted packets
42219,42220,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.346,SURREY,"You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,"
42220,42221,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.347,SURREY,"Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious."
42221,42222,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.348,SURREY,"My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,"
42222,42223,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.349,SURREY,"As you respect the common good, the state"
42223,42224,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.350,SURREY,"Of our despised nobility, our issues,"
42224,42225,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.351,SURREY,"Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,"
42225,42226,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.352,SURREY,"Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles"
42226,42227,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.353,SURREY,Collected from his life. I'll startle you
42227,42228,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.354,SURREY,"Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench"
42228,42229,Henry VIII,78.0,3.2.355,SURREY,"Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal."
42229,42230,Henry VIII,79.0,3.2.356,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"How much, methinks, I could despise this man,"
42230,42231,Henry VIII,79.0,3.2.357,CARDINAL WOLSEY,But that I am bound in charity against it!
42231,42232,Henry VIII,80.0,3.2.358,NORFOLK,"Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:"
42232,42233,Henry VIII,80.0,3.2.359,NORFOLK,"But, thus much, they are foul ones."
42233,42234,Henry VIII,81.0,3.2.360,CARDINAL WOLSEY,So much fairer
42234,42235,Henry VIII,81.0,3.2.361,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And spotless shall mine innocence arise,"
42235,42236,Henry VIII,81.0,3.2.362,CARDINAL WOLSEY,When the king knows my truth.
42236,42237,Henry VIII,82.0,3.2.363,SURREY,This cannot save you:
42237,42238,Henry VIII,82.0,3.2.364,SURREY,"I thank my memory, I yet remember"
42238,42239,Henry VIII,82.0,3.2.365,SURREY,"Some of these articles, and out they shall."
42239,42240,Henry VIII,82.0,3.2.366,SURREY,"Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,"
42240,42241,Henry VIII,82.0,3.2.367,SURREY,You'll show a little honesty.
42241,42242,Henry VIII,83.0,3.2.368,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Speak on, sir,"
42242,42243,Henry VIII,83.0,3.2.369,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I dare your worst objections: if I blush,"
42243,42244,Henry VIII,83.0,3.2.370,CARDINAL WOLSEY,It is to see a nobleman want manners.
42244,42245,Henry VIII,84.0,3.2.371,SURREY,I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
42245,42246,Henry VIII,84.0,3.2.372,SURREY,"First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,"
42246,42247,Henry VIII,84.0,3.2.373,SURREY,"You wrought to be a legate, by which power"
42247,42248,Henry VIII,84.0,3.2.374,SURREY,You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.
42248,42249,Henry VIII,85.0,3.2.375,NORFOLK,"Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else"
42249,42250,Henry VIII,85.0,3.2.376,NORFOLK,"To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'"
42250,42251,Henry VIII,85.0,3.2.377,NORFOLK,"Was still inscribed, in which you brought the king"

42252,42253,Henry VIII,86.0,3.2.379,SUFFOLK,"Then that, without the knowledge"

42254,42255,Henry VIII,86.0,3.2.381,SUFFOLK,"Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold"
42255,42256,Henry VIII,86.0,3.2.382,SUFFOLK,To carry into Flanders the great seal.
42256,42257,Henry VIII,87.0,3.2.383,SURREY,"Item, you sent a large commission"
42257,42258,Henry VIII,87.0,3.2.384,SURREY,"To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,"
42258,42259,Henry VIII,87.0,3.2.385,SURREY,"Without the king's will or the state's allowance,"
42259,42260,Henry VIII,87.0,3.2.386,SURREY,A league between his highness and Ferrara.
42260,42261,Henry VIII,88.0,3.2.387,SUFFOLK,"That, out of mere ambition, you have caused"
42261,42262,Henry VIII,88.0,3.2.388,SUFFOLK,Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.
42262,42263,Henry VIII,89.0,3.2.389,SURREY,Then that you have sent innumerable substance--
42263,42264,Henry VIII,89.0,3.2.390,SURREY,"By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--"
42264,42265,Henry VIII,89.0,3.2.391,SURREY,"To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways"
42265,42266,Henry VIII,89.0,3.2.392,SURREY,"You have for dignities, to the mere undoing"
42266,42267,Henry VIII,89.0,3.2.393,SURREY,"Of all the kingdom. Many more there are,"
42267,42268,Henry VIII,89.0,3.2.394,SURREY,"Which, since they are of you, and odious,"
42268,42269,Henry VIII,89.0,3.2.395,SURREY,I will not taint my mouth with.
42269,42270,Henry VIII,90.0,3.2.396,Chamberlain,"O my lord,"
42270,42271,Henry VIII,90.0,3.2.397,Chamberlain,Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:
42271,42272,Henry VIII,90.0,3.2.398,Chamberlain,"His faults lie open to the laws, let them,"
42272,42273,Henry VIII,90.0,3.2.399,Chamberlain,"Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him"
42273,42274,Henry VIII,90.0,3.2.400,Chamberlain,So little of his great self.
42274,42275,Henry VIII,91.0,3.2.401,SURREY,I forgive him.
42275,42276,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.402,SUFFOLK,"Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,"
42276,42277,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.403,SUFFOLK,"Because all those things you have done of late,"
42277,42278,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.404,SUFFOLK,"By your power legatine, within this kingdom,"
42278,42279,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.405,SUFFOLK,"Fall into the compass of a praemunire,"
42279,42280,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.406,SUFFOLK,"That therefore such a writ be sued against you,"
42280,42281,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.407,SUFFOLK,"To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,"
42281,42282,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.408,SUFFOLK,"Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be"
42282,42283,Henry VIII,92.0,3.2.409,SUFFOLK,Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.
42283,42284,Henry VIII,93.0,3.2.410,NORFOLK,And so we'll leave you to your meditations
42284,42285,Henry VIII,93.0,3.2.411,NORFOLK,How to live better. For your stubborn answer
42285,42286,Henry VIII,93.0,3.2.412,NORFOLK,"About the giving back the great seal to us,"
42286,42287,Henry VIII,93.0,3.2.413,NORFOLK,"The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you."
42287,42288,Henry VIII,93.0,3.2.414,NORFOLK,"So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal."
42288,42289,Henry VIII,93.0,,NORFOLK,Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY
42289,42290,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.415,CARDINAL WOLSEY,So farewell to the little good you bear me.
42290,42291,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.416,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!"
42291,42292,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.417,CARDINAL WOLSEY,This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
42292,42293,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.418,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The tender leaves of hopes, to-morrow blossoms,"
42293,42294,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.419,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And bears his blushing honours thick upon him,"
42294,42295,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.420,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,"
42295,42296,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.421,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely"
42296,42297,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.422,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,"
42297,42298,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.423,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,"
42298,42299,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.424,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,"
42299,42300,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.425,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"This many summers in a sea of glory,"
42300,42301,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.426,CARDINAL WOLSEY,But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
42301,42302,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.427,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"At length broke under me and now has left me,"
42302,42303,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.428,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Weary and old with service, to the mercy"
42303,42304,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.429,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me."
42304,42305,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.430,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:"
42305,42306,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.431,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched"
42306,42307,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.432,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
42307,42308,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.433,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,"
42308,42309,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.434,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,"
42309,42310,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.435,CARDINAL WOLSEY,More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
42310,42311,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.436,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,"
42311,42312,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.437,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Never to hope again.
42312,42313,Henry VIII,94.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed"
42313,42314,Henry VIII,94.0,3.2.438,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Why, how now, Cromwell!"
42314,42315,Henry VIII,95.0,3.2.439,CROMWELL,"I have no power to speak, sir."
42315,42316,Henry VIII,96.0,3.2.440,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What, amazed"
42316,42317,Henry VIII,96.0,3.2.441,CARDINAL WOLSEY,At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
42317,42318,Henry VIII,96.0,3.2.442,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,"
42318,42319,Henry VIII,96.0,3.2.443,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I am fall'n indeed.
42319,42320,Henry VIII,97.0,3.2.444,CROMWELL,How does your grace?
42320,42321,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.445,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Why, well,"
42321,42322,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.446,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell."
42322,42323,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.447,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I know myself now, and I feel within me"
42323,42324,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.448,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A peace above all earthly dignities,"
42324,42325,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.449,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,"
42325,42326,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.450,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I humbly thank his grace, and from these shoulders,"
42326,42327,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.451,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken"
42327,42328,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.452,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A load would sink a navy, too much honour:"
42328,42329,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.453,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen"
42329,42330,Henry VIII,98.0,3.2.454,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!
42330,42331,Henry VIII,99.0,3.2.455,CROMWELL,I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.
42331,42332,Henry VIII,100.0,3.2.456,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,"
42332,42333,Henry VIII,100.0,3.2.457,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,"
42333,42334,Henry VIII,100.0,3.2.458,CARDINAL WOLSEY,To endure more miseries and greater far
42334,42335,Henry VIII,100.0,3.2.459,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
42335,42336,Henry VIII,100.0,3.2.460,CARDINAL WOLSEY,What news abroad?
42336,42337,Henry VIII,101.0,3.2.461,CROMWELL,The heaviest and the worst
42337,42338,Henry VIII,101.0,3.2.462,CROMWELL,Is your displeasure with the king.
42338,42339,Henry VIII,102.0,3.2.463,CARDINAL WOLSEY,God bless him!
42339,42340,Henry VIII,103.0,3.2.464,CROMWELL,"The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen"
42340,42341,Henry VIII,103.0,3.2.465,CROMWELL,Lord chancellor in your place.
42341,42342,Henry VIII,104.0,3.2.466,CARDINAL WOLSEY,That's somewhat sudden:
42342,42343,Henry VIII,104.0,3.2.467,CARDINAL WOLSEY,But he's a learned man. May he continue
42343,42344,Henry VIII,104.0,3.2.468,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Long in his highness' favour, and do justice"
42344,42345,Henry VIII,104.0,3.2.469,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"For truth's sake and his conscience, that his bones,"
42345,42346,Henry VIII,104.0,3.2.470,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,"
42346,42347,Henry VIII,104.0,3.2.471,CARDINAL WOLSEY,May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?
42347,42348,Henry VIII,105.0,3.2.472,CROMWELL,"That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,"
42348,42349,Henry VIII,105.0,3.2.473,CROMWELL,Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.
42349,42350,Henry VIII,106.0,3.2.474,CARDINAL WOLSEY,That's news indeed.
42350,42351,Henry VIII,107.0,3.2.475,CROMWELL,"Last, that the Lady Anne,"
42351,42352,Henry VIII,107.0,3.2.476,CROMWELL,"Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,"
42352,42353,Henry VIII,107.0,3.2.477,CROMWELL,"This day was view'd in open as his queen,"
42353,42354,Henry VIII,107.0,3.2.478,CROMWELL,"Going to chapel, and the voice is now"
42354,42355,Henry VIII,107.0,3.2.479,CROMWELL,Only about her coronation.
42355,42356,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.480,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,"
42356,42357,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.481,CARDINAL WOLSEY,The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
42357,42358,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.482,CARDINAL WOLSEY,In that one woman I have lost for ever:
42358,42359,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.483,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,"
42359,42360,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.484,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Or gild again the noble troops that waited
42360,42361,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.485,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell,"
42361,42362,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.486,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now"
42362,42363,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.487,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To be thy lord and master: seek the king,"
42363,42364,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.488,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him"
42364,42365,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.489,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"What and how true thou art: he will advance thee,"
42365,42366,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.490,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Some little memory of me will stir him--
42366,42367,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.491,CARDINAL WOLSEY,I know his noble nature--not to let
42367,42368,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.492,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,"
42368,42369,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.493,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Neglect him not, make use now, and provide"
42369,42370,Henry VIII,108.0,3.2.494,CARDINAL WOLSEY,For thine own future safety.
42370,42371,Henry VIII,109.0,3.2.495,CROMWELL,"O my lord,"
42371,42372,Henry VIII,109.0,3.2.496,CROMWELL,"Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego"
42372,42373,Henry VIII,109.0,3.2.497,CROMWELL,"So good, so noble and so true a master?"
42373,42374,Henry VIII,109.0,3.2.498,CROMWELL,"Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,"
42374,42375,Henry VIII,109.0,3.2.499,CROMWELL,With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
42375,42376,Henry VIII,109.0,3.2.500,CROMWELL,The king shall have my service: but my prayers
42376,42377,Henry VIII,109.0,3.2.501,CROMWELL,For ever and for ever shall be yours.
42377,42378,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.502,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear"
42378,42379,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.503,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"In all my miseries, but thou hast forced me,"
42379,42380,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.504,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman."
42380,42381,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.505,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell,"
42381,42382,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.506,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,"
42382,42383,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.507,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention"
42383,42384,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.508,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,"
42384,42385,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.509,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,"
42385,42386,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.510,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,"
42386,42387,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.511,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in,"
42387,42388,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.512,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it."
42388,42389,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.513,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me."
42389,42390,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.514,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:"
42390,42391,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.515,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"By that sin fell the angels, how can man, then,"
42391,42392,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.516,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?"
42392,42393,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.517,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee,"
42393,42394,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.518,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Corruption wins not more than honesty.
42394,42395,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.519,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,"
42395,42396,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.520,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:"
42396,42397,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.521,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,"
42397,42398,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.522,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Thy God's, and truth's, then if thou fall'st,"
42398,42399,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.523,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"O Cromwell,"
42399,42400,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.524,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king,"
42400,42401,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.525,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And,--prithee, lead me in:"
42401,42402,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.526,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"There take an inventory of all I have,"
42402,42403,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.527,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"To the last penny, 'tis the king's: my robe,"
42403,42404,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.528,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"And my integrity to heaven, is all"
42404,42405,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.529,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!"
42405,42406,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.530,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Had I but served my God with half the zeal
42406,42407,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.531,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"I served my king, he would not in mine age"
42407,42408,Henry VIII,110.0,3.2.532,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Have left me naked to mine enemies.
42408,42409,Henry VIII,111.0,3.2.533,CROMWELL,"Good sir, have patience."
42409,42410,Henry VIII,112.0,3.2.534,CARDINAL WOLSEY,So I have. Farewell
42410,42411,Henry VIII,112.0,3.2.535,CARDINAL WOLSEY,The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.
42411,42412,Henry VIII,112.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Exeunt
42412,42413,Henry VIII,112.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,ACT IV
42413,42414,Henry VIII,112.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,SCENE I. A street in Westminster.
42414,42415,Henry VIII,112.0,,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another"
42415,42416,Henry VIII,1.0,4.1.1,First Gentleman,You're well met once again.
42416,42417,Henry VIII,2.0,4.1.2,Second Gentleman,So are you.
42417,42418,Henry VIII,3.0,4.1.3,First Gentleman,"You come to take your stand here, and behold"
42418,42419,Henry VIII,3.0,4.1.4,First Gentleman,The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
42419,42420,Henry VIII,4.0,4.1.5,Second Gentleman,"'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,"
42420,42421,Henry VIII,4.0,4.1.6,Second Gentleman,The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
42421,42422,Henry VIII,5.0,4.1.7,First Gentleman,"'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow,"
42422,42423,Henry VIII,5.0,4.1.8,First Gentleman,"This, general joy."
42423,42424,Henry VIII,6.0,4.1.9,Second Gentleman,"'Tis well: the citizens,"
42424,42425,Henry VIII,6.0,4.1.10,Second Gentleman,"I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--"
42425,42426,Henry VIII,6.0,4.1.11,Second Gentleman,"As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--"
42426,42427,Henry VIII,6.0,4.1.12,Second Gentleman,"In celebration of this day with shows,"
42427,42428,Henry VIII,6.0,4.1.13,Second Gentleman,Pageants and sights of honour.
42428,42429,Henry VIII,7.0,4.1.14,First Gentleman,"Never greater,"
42429,42430,Henry VIII,7.0,4.1.15,First Gentleman,"Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir."
42430,42431,Henry VIII,8.0,4.1.16,Second Gentleman,"May I be bold to ask at what that contains,"
42431,42432,Henry VIII,8.0,4.1.17,Second Gentleman,That paper in your hand?
42432,42433,Henry VIII,9.0,4.1.18,First Gentleman,"Yes, 'tis the list"
42433,42434,Henry VIII,9.0,4.1.19,First Gentleman,Of those that claim their offices this day
42434,42435,Henry VIII,9.0,4.1.20,First Gentleman,By custom of the coronation.
42435,42436,Henry VIII,9.0,4.1.21,First Gentleman,"The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims"
42436,42437,Henry VIII,9.0,4.1.22,First Gentleman,"To be high-steward, next, the Duke of Norfolk,"

42630,42631,Henry VIII,8.0,4.2.36,KATHARINE,And yet with charity. He was a man

42672,42673,Henry VIII,12.0,4.2.78,KATHARINE,But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.

Enter, solemnly tripping one after  another, six personages, clad in white robes,  wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden  vizards on their faces, branches of bays or palm in  their hands. They first congee unto her, then  dance, and, at certain changes, the first two hold  a spare garland over her head, at which the other  four make reverent curtsies, then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two,  who observe the same order in their changes, and  holding the garland over her head: which done,  they deliver the same garland to the last two, who  likewise observe the same order: at which, as it  were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:  and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues"

43129,43130,Henry VIII,15.0,5.3.58,GARDINER,"My lord, because we have business of more moment,"
43130,43131,Henry VIII,15.0,5.3.59,GARDINER,"We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,"
43131,43132,Henry VIII,15.0,5.3.60,GARDINER,"And our consent, for better trial of you,"

43149,43150,Henry VIII,17.0,5.3.78,GARDINER,"That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,"
43150,43151,Henry VIII,17.0,5.3.79,GARDINER,"To men that understand you, words and weakness."
43151,43152,Henry VIII,18.0,5.3.80,CROMWELL,"My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,"

43153,43154,Henry VIII,18.0,5.3.82,CROMWELL,"However faulty, yet should find respect"
43154,43155,Henry VIII,18.0,5.3.83,CROMWELL,For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty
43155,43156,Henry VIII,18.0,5.3.84,CROMWELL,To load a falling man.
43156,43157,Henry VIII,19.0,5.3.85,GARDINER,"Good master secretary,"
43157,43158,Henry VIII,19.0,5.3.86,GARDINER,"I cry your honour mercy, you may, worst"

43159,43160,Henry VIII,20.0,5.3.88,CROMWELL,"Why, my lord?"
43160,43161,Henry VIII,21.0,5.3.89,GARDINER,Do not I know you for a favourer
43161,43162,Henry VIII,21.0,5.3.90,GARDINER,Of this new sect? ye are not sound.
43162,43163,Henry VIII,22.0,5.3.91,CROMWELL,Not sound?
43163,43164,Henry VIII,23.0,5.3.92,GARDINER,"Not sound, I say."
43164,43165,Henry VIII,24.0,5.3.93,CROMWELL,Would you were half so honest!
43165,43166,Henry VIII,24.0,5.3.94,CROMWELL,"Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears."
43166,43167,Henry VIII,25.0,5.3.95,GARDINER,I shall remember this bold language.
43167,43168,Henry VIII,26.0,5.3.96,CROMWELL,Do.
43168,43169,Henry VIII,26.0,5.3.97,CROMWELL,Remember your bold life too.
43169,43170,Henry VIII,27.0,5.3.98,Chancellor,"This is too much,"
43170,43171,Henry VIII,27.0,5.3.99,Chancellor,"Forbear, for shame, my lords."
43171,43172,Henry VIII,28.0,5.3.100,GARDINER,I have done.
43172,43173,Henry VIII,29.0,5.3.101,CROMWELL,And I.
43173,43174,Henry VIII,30.0,5.3.102,Chancellor,"Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,"
43174,43175,Henry VIII,30.0,5.3.103,Chancellor,"I take it, by all voices, that forthwith"

9522,9523,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,,WARWICK,ACT I
9523,9524,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,,WARWICK,SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.
9524,9525,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,,WARWICK,"Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers"
9525,9526,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.1.1,WARWICK,I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
9526,9527,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.2,YORK,"While we pursued the horsemen of the north,"
9527,9528,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.3,YORK,He slily stole away and left his men:
9528,9529,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.4,YORK,"Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,"
9529,9530,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.5,YORK,"Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,"
9530,9531,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.6,YORK,"Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself,"
9531,9532,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.7,YORK,"Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,"
9532,9533,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.8,YORK,"Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in"
9533,9534,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.1.9,YORK,Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
9534,9535,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.1.10,EDWARD,"Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,"
9535,9536,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.1.11,EDWARD,"Is either slain or wounded dangerously,"
9536,9537,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.1.12,EDWARD,I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
9537,9538,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.1.13,EDWARD,"That this is true, father, behold his blood."
9538,9539,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.1.14,MONTAGUE,"And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,"
9539,9540,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.1.15,MONTAGUE,Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
9540,9541,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.1.16,RICHARD,Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
9541,9542,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,,RICHARD,Throwing down SOMERSET's head
9542,9543,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.1.17,YORK,Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
9543,9544,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.1.18,YORK,"But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?"
9544,9545,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.1.19,NORFOLK,Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
9545,9546,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,1.1.20,RICHARD,Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
9546,9547,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.1.21,WARWICK,"And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,"
9547,9548,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.1.22,WARWICK,Before I see thee seated in that throne
9548,9549,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.1.23,WARWICK,"Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,"
9549,9550,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.1.24,WARWICK,I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
9550,9551,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.1.25,WARWICK,"This is the palace of the fearful king,"
9551,9552,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.1.26,WARWICK,"And this the regal seat: possess it, York,"
9552,9553,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.1.27,WARWICK,For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
9553,9554,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.1.28,YORK,"Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will,"
9554,9555,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.1.29,YORK,For hither we have broken in by force.
9555,9556,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,1.1.30,NORFOLK,"We'll all assist you, he that flies shall die."
9556,9557,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,1.1.31,YORK,"Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords,"
9557,9558,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,1.1.32,YORK,"And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night."
9558,9559,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,,YORK,They go up
9559,9560,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,1.1.33,WARWICK,"And when the king comes, offer no violence,"
9560,9561,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,1.1.34,WARWICK,Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
9561,9562,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.1.35,YORK,"The queen this day here holds her parliament,"
9562,9563,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.1.36,YORK,But little thinks we shall be of her council:
9563,9564,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.1.37,YORK,By words or blows here let us win our right.
9564,9565,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.1.38,RICHARD,"Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house."
9565,9566,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,1.1.39,WARWICK,"The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,"
9566,9567,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,1.1.40,WARWICK,"Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,"
9567,9568,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,1.1.41,WARWICK,"And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice"
9568,9569,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,1.1.42,WARWICK,Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
9569,9570,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.1.43,YORK,"Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,"
9570,9571,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.1.44,YORK,I mean to take possession of my right.
9571,9572,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.1.45,WARWICK,"Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,"
9572,9573,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.1.46,WARWICK,"The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,"
9573,9574,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.1.47,WARWICK,"Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells."
9574,9575,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.1.48,WARWICK,"I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:"
9575,9576,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.1.49,WARWICK,"Resolve thee, Richard, claim the English crown."
9576,9577,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,,WARWICK,"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest"
9577,9578,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.1.50,KING HENRY VI,"My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,"
9578,9579,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.1.51,KING HENRY VI,"Even in the chair of state: belike he means,"
9579,9580,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.1.52,KING HENRY VI,"Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,"
9580,9581,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.1.53,KING HENRY VI,To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
9581,9582,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.1.54,KING HENRY VI,"Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father."
9582,9583,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.1.55,KING HENRY VI,"And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow'd revenge"
9583,9584,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.1.56,KING HENRY VI,"On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends."
9584,9585,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.1.57,NORTHUMBERLAND,"If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!"
9585,9586,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,1.1.58,CLIFFORD,The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
9586,9587,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,1.1.59,WESTMORELAND,"What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:"
9587,9588,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,1.1.60,WESTMORELAND,"My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it."
9588,9589,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,1.1.61,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland."
9589,9590,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.1.62,CLIFFORD,"Patience is for poltroons, such as he:"
9590,9591,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.1.63,CLIFFORD,"He durst not sit there, had your father lived."
9591,9592,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.1.64,CLIFFORD,"My gracious lord, here in the parliament"
9592,9593,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.1.65,CLIFFORD,Let us assail the family of York.
9593,9594,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,1.1.66,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so."
9594,9595,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,1.1.67,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, know you not the city favours them,"
9595,9596,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,1.1.68,KING HENRY VI,And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
9596,9597,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,1.1.69,EXETER,"But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly."
9597,9598,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,1.1.70,KING HENRY VI,"Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,"
9598,9599,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,1.1.71,KING HENRY VI,To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
9599,9600,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,1.1.72,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats"
9600,9601,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,1.1.73,KING HENRY VI,Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
9601,9602,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,1.1.74,KING HENRY VI,"Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,"
9602,9603,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,1.1.75,KING HENRY VI,"and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet,"
9603,9604,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,1.1.76,KING HENRY VI,I am thy sovereign.
9604,9605,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,1.1.77,YORK,I am thine.
9605,9606,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,1.1.78,EXETER,"For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York."
9606,9607,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,1.1.79,YORK,"'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was."
9607,9608,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,1.1.80,EXETER,Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
9608,9609,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,1.1.81,WARWICK,"Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown"
9609,9610,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,1.1.82,WARWICK,In following this usurping Henry.
9610,9611,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,1.1.83,CLIFFORD,Whom should he follow but his natural king?
9611,9612,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,1.1.84,WARWICK,"True, Clifford, and that's Richard Duke of York."
9612,9613,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,1.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?"
9613,9614,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,1.1.86,YORK,It must and shall be so: content thyself.
9614,9615,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,1.1.87,WARWICK,"Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be king."
9615,9616,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,1.1.88,WESTMORELAND,"He is both king and Duke of Lancaster,"
9616,9617,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,1.1.89,WESTMORELAND,And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
9617,9618,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,1.1.90,WARWICK,And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
9618,9619,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,1.1.91,WARWICK,That we are those which chased you from the field
9619,9620,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,1.1.92,WARWICK,"And slew your fathers, and with colours spread"
9620,9621,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,1.1.93,WARWICK,March'd through the city to the palace gates.
9621,9622,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,1.1.94,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,"
9622,9623,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,1.1.95,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it."
9623,9624,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,1.1.96,WESTMORELAND,"Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,"
9624,9625,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,1.1.97,WESTMORELAND,"Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives"
9625,9626,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,1.1.98,WESTMORELAND,Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
9626,9627,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,1.1.99,CLIFFORD,"Urge it no more, lest that, instead of words,"
9627,9628,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,1.1.100,CLIFFORD,"I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger"
9628,9629,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,1.1.101,CLIFFORD,As shall revenge his death before I stir.
9629,9630,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,1.1.102,WARWICK,Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
9630,9631,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,1.1.103,YORK,Will you we show our title to the crown?
9631,9632,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,1.1.104,YORK,"If not, our swords shall plead it in the field."
9632,9633,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,1.1.105,KING HENRY VI,"What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?"
9633,9634,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,1.1.106,KING HENRY VI,"Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,"
9634,9635,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,1.1.107,KING HENRY VI,"Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:"
9635,9636,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,1.1.108,KING HENRY VI,"I am the son of Henry the Fifth,"
9636,9637,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,1.1.109,KING HENRY VI,Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
9637,9638,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,1.1.110,KING HENRY VI,And seized upon their towns and provinces.
9638,9639,Henry VI Part 3,47.0,1.1.111,WARWICK,"Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all."
9639,9640,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,1.1.112,KING HENRY VI,"The lord protector lost it, and not I:"
9640,9641,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,1.1.113,KING HENRY VI,When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
9641,9642,Henry VI Part 3,49.0,1.1.114,RICHARD,"You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose."
9642,9643,Henry VI Part 3,49.0,1.1.115,RICHARD,"Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head."
9643,9644,Henry VI Part 3,50.0,1.1.116,EDWARD,"Sweet father, do so, set it on your head."
9644,9645,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,1.1.117,MONTAGUE,"Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,"
9645,9646,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,1.1.118,MONTAGUE,Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
9646,9647,Henry VI Part 3,52.0,1.1.119,RICHARD,"Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly."
9647,9648,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,1.1.120,YORK,"Sons, peace!"
9648,9649,Henry VI Part 3,54.0,1.1.121,KING HENRY VI,"Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak."
9649,9650,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,1.1.122,WARWICK,"Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords,"
9650,9651,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,1.1.123,WARWICK,"And be you silent and attentive too,"
9651,9652,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,1.1.124,WARWICK,For he that interrupts him shall not live.
9652,9653,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,1.1.125,KING HENRY VI,"Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,"
9653,9654,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,1.1.126,KING HENRY VI,Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
9654,9655,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,1.1.127,KING HENRY VI,"No: first shall war unpeople this my realm,"
9655,9656,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,1.1.128,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,"
9656,9657,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,1.1.129,KING HENRY VI,"And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,"
9657,9658,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,1.1.130,KING HENRY VI,"Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?"
9658,9659,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,1.1.131,KING HENRY VI,"My title's good, and better far than his."
9659,9660,Henry VI Part 3,57.0,1.1.132,WARWICK,"Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king."
9660,9661,Henry VI Part 3,58.0,1.1.133,KING HENRY VI,Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
9661,9662,Henry VI Part 3,59.0,1.1.134,YORK,'Twas by rebellion against his king.
9662,9663,Henry VI Part 3,60.0,1.1.135,KING HENRY VI,"[Aside]  I know not what to say, my title's weak.--"
9663,9664,Henry VI Part 3,60.0,1.1.136,KING HENRY VI,"Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?"
9664,9665,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,1.1.137,YORK,What then?
9665,9666,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,1.1.138,KING HENRY VI,"An if he may, then am I lawful king,"
9666,9667,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,1.1.139,KING HENRY VI,"For Richard, in the view of many lords,"
9667,9668,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,1.1.140,KING HENRY VI,"Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,"
9668,9669,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,1.1.141,KING HENRY VI,"Whose heir my father was, and I am his."
9669,9670,Henry VI Part 3,63.0,1.1.142,YORK,"He rose against him, being his sovereign,"
9670,9671,Henry VI Part 3,63.0,1.1.143,YORK,And made him to resign his crown perforce.
9671,9672,Henry VI Part 3,64.0,1.1.144,WARWICK,"Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,"
9672,9673,Henry VI Part 3,64.0,1.1.145,WARWICK,Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
9673,9674,Henry VI Part 3,65.0,1.1.146,EXETER,"No, for he could not so resign his crown"
9674,9675,Henry VI Part 3,65.0,1.1.147,EXETER,But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
9675,9676,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,1.1.148,KING HENRY VI,"Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?"
9676,9677,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,1.1.149,EXETER,"His is the right, and therefore pardon me."
9677,9678,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,1.1.150,YORK,"Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?"
9678,9679,Henry VI Part 3,69.0,1.1.151,EXETER,My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
9679,9680,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,1.1.152,KING HENRY VI,"[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him."
9680,9681,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,1.1.153,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,"
9681,9682,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,1.1.154,NORTHUMBERLAND,Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
9682,9683,Henry VI Part 3,72.0,1.1.155,WARWICK,"Deposed he shall be, in despite of all."
9683,9684,Henry VI Part 3,73.0,1.1.156,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,"
9684,9685,Henry VI Part 3,73.0,1.1.157,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,"
9685,9686,Henry VI Part 3,73.0,1.1.158,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,"
9686,9687,Henry VI Part 3,73.0,1.1.159,NORTHUMBERLAND,Can set the duke up in despite of me.
9687,9688,Henry VI Part 3,74.0,1.1.160,CLIFFORD,"King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,"
9688,9689,Henry VI Part 3,74.0,1.1.161,CLIFFORD,Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
9689,9690,Henry VI Part 3,74.0,1.1.162,CLIFFORD,"May that ground gape and swallow me alive,"
9690,9691,Henry VI Part 3,74.0,1.1.163,CLIFFORD,Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
9691,9692,Henry VI Part 3,75.0,1.1.164,KING HENRY VI,"O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!"
9692,9693,Henry VI Part 3,76.0,1.1.165,YORK,"Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown."
9693,9694,Henry VI Part 3,76.0,1.1.166,YORK,"What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?"
9694,9695,Henry VI Part 3,77.0,1.1.167,WARWICK,"Do right unto this princely Duke of York,"
9695,9696,Henry VI Part 3,77.0,1.1.168,WARWICK,"Or I will fill the house with armed men,"
9696,9697,Henry VI Part 3,77.0,1.1.169,WARWICK,"And over the chair of state, where now he sits,"
9697,9698,Henry VI Part 3,77.0,1.1.170,WARWICK,Write up his title with usurping blood.
9698,9699,Henry VI Part 3,77.0,,WARWICK,He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves

9753,9754,Henry VI Part 3,110.0,1.1.221,QUEEN MARGARET,Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
9754,9755,Henry VI Part 3,110.0,1.1.222,QUEEN MARGARET,Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?

9759,9760,Henry VI Part 3,110.0,1.1.227,QUEEN MARGARET,Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
9760,9761,Henry VI Part 3,110.0,1.1.228,QUEEN MARGARET,And disinherited thine only son.
9761,9762,Henry VI Part 3,111.0,1.1.229,PRINCE EDWARD,"Father, you cannot disinherit me:"

9768,9769,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.236,QUEEN MARGARET,And given unto the house of York such head
9769,9770,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.237,QUEEN MARGARET,As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
9770,9771,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.238,QUEEN MARGARET,"To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,"

9772,9773,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.240,QUEEN MARGARET,And creep into it far before thy time?

9776,9777,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.244,QUEEN MARGARET,And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
9777,9778,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.245,QUEEN MARGARET,The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
9778,9779,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.246,QUEEN MARGARET,"Had I been there, which am a silly woman,"
9779,9780,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.247,QUEEN MARGARET,The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
9780,9781,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.248,QUEEN MARGARET,Before I would have granted to that act.
9781,9782,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.249,QUEEN MARGARET,But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
9782,9783,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.250,QUEEN MARGARET,"And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself"
9783,9784,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.251,QUEEN MARGARET,"Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,"
9784,9785,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.252,QUEEN MARGARET,Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
9785,9786,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.253,QUEEN MARGARET,Whereby my son is disinherited.

9787,9788,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.255,QUEEN MARGARET,"Will follow mine, if once they see them spread,"
9788,9789,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.256,QUEEN MARGARET,"And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace"
9789,9790,Henry VI Part 3,113.0,1.1.257,QUEEN MARGARET,And utter ruin of the house of York.

9805,9806,Henry VI Part 3,120.0,1.1.272,KING HENRY VI,Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
9806,9807,Henry VI Part 3,120.0,1.1.273,KING HENRY VI,The loss of those three lords torments my heart:

9815,9816,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.2.3,MONTAGUE,But I have reasons strong and forcible.
9816,9817,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,,MONTAGUE,Enter YORK
9817,9818,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.2.4,YORK,"Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?"
9818,9819,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.2.5,YORK,What is your quarrel? how began it first?
9819,9820,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.2.6,EDWARD,"No quarrel, but a slight contention."
9820,9821,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.2.7,YORK,About what?
9821,9822,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.2.8,RICHARD,"About that which concerns your grace and us,"

9824,9825,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.2.11,RICHARD,Your right depends not on his life or death.

9828,9829,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,1.2.15,YORK,I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
9829,9830,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,1.2.16,EDWARD,But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
9830,9831,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,1.2.17,EDWARD,I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
9831,9832,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,1.2.18,RICHARD,"No, God forbid your grace should be forsworn."

9837,9838,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.2.24,RICHARD,That hath authority over him that swears:

9839,9840,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.2.26,RICHARD,"Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,"

9841,9842,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.2.28,RICHARD,"Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think"

9844,9845,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.2.31,RICHARD,And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
9845,9846,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.2.32,RICHARD,Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
9846,9847,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.2.33,RICHARD,Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
9847,9848,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.2.34,RICHARD,Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
9848,9849,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.2.35,YORK,"Richard, enough, I will be king, or die."

9858,9859,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.2.45,YORK,"But that I seek occasion how to rise,"
9859,9860,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.2.46,YORK,"And yet the king not privy to my drift,"
9860,9861,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.2.47,YORK,Nor any of the house of Lancaster?

9867,9868,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.2.53,YORK,"Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?"
9868,9869,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.2.54,YORK,"Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me,"
9869,9870,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.2.55,YORK,My brother Montague shall post to London:

9873,9874,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.2.59,YORK,And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
9874,9875,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,1.2.60,MONTAGUE,"Brother, I go, I'll win them, fear it not:"
9875,9876,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,1.2.61,MONTAGUE,And thus most humbly I do take my leave.

9880,9881,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,1.2.64,MONTAGUE,The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
9881,9882,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,1.2.65,JOHN MORTIMER,"She shall not need, we'll meet her in the field."
9882,9883,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,1.2.66,YORK,"What, with five thousand men?"
9883,9884,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.2.67,RICHARD,"Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:"
9884,9885,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.2.68,RICHARD,"A woman's general, what should we fear?"
9885,9886,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,,RICHARD,A march afar off
9886,9887,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,1.2.69,EDWARD,"I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,"
9887,9888,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,1.2.70,EDWARD,And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
9888,9889,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,1.2.71,YORK,"Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,"
9889,9890,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,1.2.72,YORK,"I doubt not, uncle, of our victory."
9890,9891,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,1.2.73,YORK,"Many a battle have I won in France,"
9891,9892,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,1.2.74,YORK,When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
9892,9893,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,1.2.75,YORK,Why should I not now have the like success?
9893,9894,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,,YORK,Alarum. Exeunt
9894,9895,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,,YORK,SCENE III. Field of battle betwixt Sandal Castle and Wakefield.
9895,9896,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,,YORK,Alarums. Enter RUTLAND and his Tutor
9896,9897,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.3.1,RUTLAND,"Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?"
9897,9898,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.3.2,RUTLAND,"Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!"
9898,9899,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,RUTLAND,Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers
9899,9900,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.3.3,CLIFFORD,"Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life."
9900,9901,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.3.4,CLIFFORD,"As for the brat of this accursed duke,"
9901,9902,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.3.5,CLIFFORD,"Whose father slew my father, he shall die."
9902,9903,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.3.6,Tutor,"And I, my lord, will bear him company."
9903,9904,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.3.7,CLIFFORD,"Soldiers, away with him!"
9904,9905,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.3.8,Tutor,"Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,"
9905,9906,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.3.9,Tutor,Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
9906,9907,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,,Tutor,"Exit, dragged off by Soldiers"
9907,9908,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.3.10,CLIFFORD,How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
9908,9909,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.3.11,CLIFFORD,That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
9909,9910,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.12,RUTLAND,So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
9910,9911,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.13,RUTLAND,"That trembles under his devouring paws,"
9911,9912,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.14,RUTLAND,"And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,"
9912,9913,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.15,RUTLAND,"And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder."
9913,9914,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.16,RUTLAND,"Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,"
9914,9915,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.17,RUTLAND,And not with such a cruel threatening look.
9915,9916,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.18,RUTLAND,"Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die."
9916,9917,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.19,RUTLAND,I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
9917,9918,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.3.20,RUTLAND,"Be thou revenged on men, and let me live."
9918,9919,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,1.3.21,CLIFFORD,"In vain thou speak'st, poor boy, my father's blood"
9919,9920,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,1.3.22,CLIFFORD,Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
9920,9921,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.3.23,RUTLAND,Then let my father's blood open it again:
9921,9922,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.3.24,RUTLAND,"He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him."
9922,9923,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.25,CLIFFORD,"Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine"
9923,9924,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.26,CLIFFORD,"Were not revenge sufficient for me,"
9924,9925,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.27,CLIFFORD,"No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves"
9925,9926,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.28,CLIFFORD,"And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,"
9926,9927,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.29,CLIFFORD,"It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart."
9927,9928,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.30,CLIFFORD,The sight of any of the house of York
9928,9929,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.31,CLIFFORD,"Is as a fury to torment my soul,"
9929,9930,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.32,CLIFFORD,And till I root out their accursed line
9930,9931,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.33,CLIFFORD,"And leave not one alive, I live in hell."
9931,9932,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.3.34,CLIFFORD,Therefore--
9932,9933,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,,CLIFFORD,Lifting his hand
9933,9934,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,1.3.35,RUTLAND,"O, let me pray before I take my death!"
9934,9935,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,1.3.36,RUTLAND,"To thee I pray, sweet Clifford, pity me!"
9935,9936,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,1.3.37,CLIFFORD,Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
9936,9937,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,1.3.38,RUTLAND,I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
9937,9938,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.3.39,CLIFFORD,Thy father hath.
9938,9939,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.3.40,RUTLAND,But 'twas ere I was born.
9939,9940,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.3.41,RUTLAND,"Thou hast one son, for his sake pity me,"
9940,9941,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.3.42,RUTLAND,"Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,"
9941,9942,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.3.43,RUTLAND,He be as miserably slain as I.
9942,9943,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.3.44,RUTLAND,"Ah, let me live in prison all my days,"
9943,9944,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.3.45,RUTLAND,"And when I give occasion of offence,"
9944,9945,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.3.46,RUTLAND,"Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause."
9945,9946,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,1.3.47,CLIFFORD,No cause!
9946,9947,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,1.3.48,CLIFFORD,"Thy father slew my father, therefore, die."
9947,9948,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,,CLIFFORD,Stabs him
9948,9949,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.3.49,RUTLAND,Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
9949,9950,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,,RUTLAND,Dies
9950,9951,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.3.50,CLIFFORD,"Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!"
9951,9952,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.3.51,CLIFFORD,And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
9952,9953,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.3.52,CLIFFORD,"Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,"
9953,9954,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.3.53,CLIFFORD,"Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both."
9954,9955,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,,CLIFFORD,Exit
9955,9956,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,,CLIFFORD,SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
9956,9957,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,,CLIFFORD,Alarum. Enter YORK
9957,9958,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.1,YORK,The army of the queen hath got the field:
9958,9959,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.2,YORK,"My uncles both are slain in rescuing me,"
9959,9960,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.3,YORK,And all my followers to the eager foe
9960,9961,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.4,YORK,"Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind"
9961,9962,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.5,YORK,Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
9962,9963,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.6,YORK,"My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:"
9963,9964,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.7,YORK,"But this I know, they have demean'd themselves"
9964,9965,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.8,YORK,Like men born to renown by life or death.
9965,9966,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.9,YORK,Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
9966,9967,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.10,YORK,"And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'"
9967,9968,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.11,YORK,"And full as oft came Edward to my side,"
9968,9969,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.12,YORK,"With purple falchion, painted to the hilt"
9969,9970,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.13,YORK,In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
9970,9971,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.14,YORK,"And when the hardiest warriors did retire,"
9971,9972,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.15,YORK,Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
9972,9973,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.16,YORK,"And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!"
9973,9974,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.17,YORK,"A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'"
9974,9975,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.18,YORK,"With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!"
9975,9976,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.19,YORK,"We bodged again, as I have seen a swan"
9976,9977,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.20,YORK,With bootless labour swim against the tide
9977,9978,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.21,YORK,And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
9978,9979,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,YORK,A short alarum within
9979,9980,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.22,YORK,"Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue,"
9980,9981,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.23,YORK,And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
9981,9982,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.24,YORK,"And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:"
9982,9983,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.25,YORK,"The sands are number'd that make up my life,"
9983,9984,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.26,YORK,"Here must I stay, and here my life must end."
9984,9985,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,YORK,"Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, PRINCE EDWARD, and Soldiers"
9985,9986,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.27,YORK,"Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,"
9986,9987,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.28,YORK,I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
9987,9988,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,1.4.29,YORK,"I am your butt, and I abide your shot."
9988,9989,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,1.4.30,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet."
9989,9990,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.4.31,CLIFFORD,"Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,"
9990,9991,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.4.32,CLIFFORD,"With downright payment, show'd unto my father."
9991,9992,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.4.33,CLIFFORD,"Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,"
9992,9993,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,1.4.34,CLIFFORD,And made an evening at the noontide prick.
9993,9994,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.4.35,YORK,"My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth"
9994,9995,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.4.36,YORK,A bird that will revenge upon you all:
9995,9996,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.4.37,YORK,"And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,"
9996,9997,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.4.38,YORK,Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
9997,9998,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,1.4.39,YORK,"Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?"
9998,9999,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.4.40,CLIFFORD,"So cowards fight when they can fly no further,"
9999,10000,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.4.41,CLIFFORD,"So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons,"
10000,10001,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.4.42,CLIFFORD,"So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,"
10001,10002,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,1.4.43,CLIFFORD,Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
10002,10003,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.4.44,YORK,"O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,"
10003,10004,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.4.45,YORK,"And in thy thought o'er-run my former time,"
10004,10005,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.4.46,YORK,"And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,"
10005,10006,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.4.47,YORK,"And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice"
10006,10007,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,1.4.48,YORK,Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
10007,10008,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.4.49,CLIFFORD,"I will not bandy with thee word for word,"
10008,10009,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,1.4.50,CLIFFORD,"But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one."
10009,10010,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,1.4.51,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes"
10010,10011,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,1.4.52,QUEEN MARGARET,I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
10011,10012,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,1.4.53,QUEEN MARGARET,"Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland."
10012,10013,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.4.54,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much"
10013,10014,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.4.55,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:"
10014,10015,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.4.56,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,"
10015,10016,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.4.57,NORTHUMBERLAND,"For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,"
10016,10017,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.4.58,NORTHUMBERLAND,When he might spurn him with his foot away?
10017,10018,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.4.59,NORTHUMBERLAND,"It is war's prize to take all vantages,"
10018,10019,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,1.4.60,NORTHUMBERLAND,And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
10019,10020,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,,NORTHUMBERLAND,"They lay hands on YORK, who struggles"
10020,10021,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,1.4.61,CLIFFORD,"Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin."
10021,10022,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,1.4.62,NORTHUMBERLAND,So doth the cony struggle in the net.
10022,10023,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,1.4.63,YORK,"So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty,"
10023,10024,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,1.4.64,YORK,"So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd."
10024,10025,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,1.4.65,NORTHUMBERLAND,What would your grace have done unto him now?
10025,10026,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.66,QUEEN MARGARET,"Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,"
10026,10027,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.67,QUEEN MARGARET,"Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,"
10027,10028,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.68,QUEEN MARGARET,"That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,"
10028,10029,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.69,QUEEN MARGARET,Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
10029,10030,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.70,QUEEN MARGARET,What! was it you that would be England's king?
10030,10031,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.71,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,"
10031,10032,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.72,QUEEN MARGARET,And made a preachment of your high descent?
10032,10033,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.73,QUEEN MARGARET,Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
10033,10034,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?"
10034,10035,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,"
10035,10036,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice"
10036,10037,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.77,QUEEN MARGARET,Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
10037,10038,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?"
10038,10039,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood"
10039,10040,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.80,QUEEN MARGARET,"That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,"
10040,10041,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Made issue from the bosom of the boy,"
10041,10042,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if thine eyes can water for his death,"
10042,10043,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.83,QUEEN MARGARET,I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
10043,10044,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.84,QUEEN MARGARET,"Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,"
10044,10045,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.85,QUEEN MARGARET,I should lament thy miserable state.
10045,10046,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.86,QUEEN MARGARET,"I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York."
10046,10047,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.87,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails"
10047,10048,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.88,QUEEN MARGARET,That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
10048,10049,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.89,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad,"
10049,10050,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.90,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus."
10050,10051,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.91,QUEEN MARGARET,"Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance."
10051,10052,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.92,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:"
10052,10053,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.93,QUEEN MARGARET,"York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown."
10053,10054,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.94,QUEEN MARGARET,"A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:"
10054,10055,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.95,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on."
10055,10056,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Putting a paper crown on his head
10056,10057,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.96,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!"
10057,10058,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.97,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,"
10058,10059,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.98,QUEEN MARGARET,And this is he was his adopted heir.
10059,10060,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.99,QUEEN MARGARET,But how is it that great Plantagenet
10060,10061,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.100,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?"
10061,10062,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.101,QUEEN MARGARET,"As I bethink me, you should not be king"
10062,10063,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.102,QUEEN MARGARET,Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
10063,10064,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.103,QUEEN MARGARET,"And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,"
10064,10065,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.104,QUEEN MARGARET,"And rob his temples of the diadem,"
10065,10066,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.105,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now in his life, against your holy oath?"
10066,10067,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.106,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!"
10067,10068,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.107,QUEEN MARGARET,"Off with the crown, and with the crown his head,"
10068,10069,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,1.4.108,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead."
10069,10070,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,1.4.109,CLIFFORD,"That is my office, for my father's sake."
10070,10071,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,1.4.110,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, stay, lets hear the orisons he makes."
10071,10072,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.111,YORK,"She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,"
10072,10073,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.112,YORK,Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
10073,10074,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.113,YORK,How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
10074,10075,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.114,YORK,"To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,"
10075,10076,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.115,YORK,Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
10076,10077,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.116,YORK,"But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,"
10077,10078,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.117,YORK,"Made impudent with use of evil deeds,"
10078,10079,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.118,YORK,"I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush."
10079,10080,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.119,YORK,"To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,"
10080,10081,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.120,YORK,"Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless."
10081,10082,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.121,YORK,"Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,"
10082,10083,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.122,YORK,"Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,"
10083,10084,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.123,YORK,Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
10084,10085,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.124,YORK,Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
10085,10086,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.125,YORK,"It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,"
10086,10087,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.126,YORK,"Unless the adage must be verified,"
10087,10088,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.127,YORK,That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
10088,10089,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.128,YORK,"'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,"
10089,10090,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.129,YORK,"But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:"
10090,10091,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.130,YORK,"'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired,"
10091,10092,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.131,YORK,The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
10092,10093,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.132,YORK,"'Tis government that makes them seem divine,"
10093,10094,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.133,YORK,The want thereof makes thee abominable:
10094,10095,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.134,YORK,Thou art as opposite to every good
10095,10096,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.135,YORK,"As the Antipodes are unto us,"
10096,10097,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.136,YORK,Or as the south to the septentrion.
10097,10098,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.137,YORK,O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
10098,10099,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.138,YORK,"How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,"
10099,10100,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.139,YORK,"To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,"
10100,10101,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.140,YORK,And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
10101,10102,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.141,YORK,"Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible,"
10102,10103,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.142,YORK,"Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless."
10103,10104,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.143,YORK,"Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:"
10104,10105,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.144,YORK,"Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:"
10105,10106,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.145,YORK,"For raging wind blows up incessant showers,"
10106,10107,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.146,YORK,"And when the rage allays, the rain begins."
10107,10108,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.147,YORK,These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
10108,10109,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.148,YORK,"And every drop cries vengeance for his death,"
10109,10110,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.149,YORK,"'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false"
10110,10111,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,1.4.150,YORK,Frenchwoman.
10111,10112,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.4.151,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so"
10112,10113,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,1.4.152,NORTHUMBERLAND,That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
10113,10114,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.153,YORK,That face of his the hungry cannibals
10114,10115,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.154,YORK,"Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:"
10115,10116,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.155,YORK,"But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,"
10116,10117,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.156,YORK,"O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania."
10117,10118,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.157,YORK,"See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:"
10118,10119,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.158,YORK,"This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,"
10119,10120,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.159,YORK,And I with tears do wash the blood away.
10120,10121,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.160,YORK,"Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:"
10121,10122,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.161,YORK,"And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,"
10122,10123,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.162,YORK,"Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears,"
10123,10124,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.163,YORK,"Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,"
10124,10125,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.164,YORK,"And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'"
10125,10126,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.165,YORK,"There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse,"
10126,10127,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.166,YORK,And in thy need such comfort come to thee
10127,10128,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.167,YORK,As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
10128,10129,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.168,YORK,"Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:"
10129,10130,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,1.4.169,YORK,"My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!"
10130,10131,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.4.170,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,"
10131,10132,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.4.171,NORTHUMBERLAND,I should not for my life but weep with him.
10132,10133,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,1.4.172,NORTHUMBERLAND,To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
10133,10134,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,1.4.173,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?"
10134,10135,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,1.4.174,QUEEN MARGARET,"Think but upon the wrong he did us all,"
10135,10136,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,1.4.175,QUEEN MARGARET,And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
10136,10137,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,1.4.176,CLIFFORD,"Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death."
10137,10138,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,,CLIFFORD,Stabbing him
10138,10139,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,1.4.177,QUEEN MARGARET,And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
10139,10140,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Stabbing him
10140,10141,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.4.178,YORK,"Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!"
10141,10142,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,1.4.179,YORK,My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
10142,10143,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,,YORK,Dies
10143,10144,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,1.4.180,QUEEN MARGARET,"Off with his head, and set it on York gates,"
10144,10145,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,1.4.181,QUEEN MARGARET,So York may overlook the town of York.
10145,10146,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Flourish. Exeunt
10146,10147,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,ACT II
10147,10148,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.
10148,10149,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,"A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power"
10149,10150,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.1,EDWARD,"I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,"
10150,10151,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.2,EDWARD,Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
10151,10152,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.3,EDWARD,From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
10152,10153,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.4,EDWARD,"Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news,"
10153,10154,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.5,EDWARD,"Had he been slain, we should have heard the news,"
10154,10155,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.6,EDWARD,"Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard"
10155,10156,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.7,EDWARD,The happy tidings of his good escape.
10156,10157,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.1.8,EDWARD,How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
10157,10158,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.9,RICHARD,"I cannot joy, until I be resolved"
10158,10159,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.10,RICHARD,Where our right valiant father is become.
10159,10160,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.11,RICHARD,"I saw him in the battle range about,"
10160,10161,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.12,RICHARD,And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
10161,10162,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.13,RICHARD,Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
10162,10163,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.14,RICHARD,"As doth a lion in a herd of neat,"
10163,10164,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.15,RICHARD,"Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,"
10164,10165,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.16,RICHARD,"Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,"
10165,10166,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.17,RICHARD,"The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him."
10166,10167,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.18,RICHARD,"So fared our father with his enemies,"
10167,10168,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.19,RICHARD,So fled his enemies my warlike father:
10168,10169,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.20,RICHARD,"Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son."
10169,10170,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.21,RICHARD,"See how the morning opes her golden gates,"
10170,10171,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.22,RICHARD,And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
10171,10172,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.23,RICHARD,"How well resembles it the prime of youth,"
10172,10173,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.1.24,RICHARD,Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
10173,10174,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.1.25,EDWARD,"Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?"
10174,10175,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.1.26,RICHARD,"Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,"
10175,10176,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.1.27,RICHARD,"Not separated with the racking clouds,"
10176,10177,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.1.28,RICHARD,But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
10177,10178,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.1.29,RICHARD,"See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,"
10178,10179,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.1.30,RICHARD,As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
10179,10180,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.1.31,RICHARD,"Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun."
10180,10181,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.1.32,RICHARD,In this the heaven figures some event.
10181,10182,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.33,EDWARD,"'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of."
10182,10183,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.34,EDWARD,"I think it cites us, brother, to the field,"
10183,10184,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.35,EDWARD,"That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,"
10184,10185,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.36,EDWARD,"Each one already blazing by our meeds,"
10185,10186,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.37,EDWARD,Should notwithstanding join our lights together
10186,10187,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.38,EDWARD,And over-shine the earth as this the world.
10187,10188,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.39,EDWARD,"Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear"
10188,10189,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.1.40,EDWARD,Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
10189,10190,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.1.41,RICHARD,"Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,"
10190,10191,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.1.42,RICHARD,You love the breeder better than the male.
10191,10192,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,,RICHARD,Enter a Messenger
10192,10193,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.1.43,RICHARD,"But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell"
10193,10194,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.1.44,RICHARD,Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
10194,10195,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.1.45,Messenger,"Ah, one that was a woful looker-on"
10195,10196,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.1.46,Messenger,"When as the noble Duke of York was slain,"
10196,10197,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.1.47,Messenger,Your princely father and my loving lord!
10197,10198,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,2.1.48,EDWARD,"O, speak no more, for I have heard too much."
10198,10199,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.1.49,RICHARD,"Say how he died, for I will hear it all."
10199,10200,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.50,Messenger,"Environed he was with many foes,"
10200,10201,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.51,Messenger,"And stood against them, as the hope of Troy"
10201,10202,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.52,Messenger,Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
10202,10203,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.53,Messenger,"But Hercules himself must yield to odds,"
10203,10204,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.54,Messenger,"And many strokes, though with a little axe,"
10204,10205,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.55,Messenger,Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
10205,10206,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.56,Messenger,"By many hands your father was subdued,"
10206,10207,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.57,Messenger,But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
10207,10208,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.58,Messenger,"Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,"
10208,10209,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.59,Messenger,"Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,"
10209,10210,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.60,Messenger,"Laugh'd in his face, and when with grief he wept,"
10210,10211,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.61,Messenger,The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
10211,10212,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.62,Messenger,A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
10212,10213,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.63,Messenger,"Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:"
10213,10214,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.64,Messenger,"And after many scorns, many foul taunts,"
10214,10215,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.65,Messenger,"They took his head, and on the gates of York"
10215,10216,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.66,Messenger,"They set the same, and there it doth remain,"
10216,10217,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.1.67,Messenger,The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
10217,10218,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.68,EDWARD,"Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,"
10218,10219,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.69,EDWARD,"Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay."
10219,10220,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.70,EDWARD,"O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain"
10220,10221,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.71,EDWARD,"The flower of Europe for his chivalry,"
10221,10222,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.72,EDWARD,"And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,"
10222,10223,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.73,EDWARD,For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
10223,10224,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.74,EDWARD,Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
10224,10225,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.75,EDWARD,"Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body"
10225,10226,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.76,EDWARD,Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
10226,10227,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.77,EDWARD,"For never henceforth shall I joy again,"
10227,10228,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.1.78,EDWARD,"Never, O never shall I see more joy!"
10228,10229,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.79,RICHARD,"I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture"
10229,10230,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.80,RICHARD,Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
10230,10231,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.81,RICHARD,"Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen,"
10231,10232,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.82,RICHARD,For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
10232,10233,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.83,RICHARD,"Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,"
10233,10234,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.84,RICHARD,And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
10234,10235,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.85,RICHARD,To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
10235,10236,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.86,RICHARD,"Tears then for babes, blows and revenge for me"
10236,10237,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.87,RICHARD,"Richard, I bear thy name, I'll venge thy death,"
10237,10238,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.1.88,RICHARD,Or die renowned by attempting it.
10238,10239,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,2.1.89,EDWARD,"His name that valiant duke hath left with thee,"
10239,10240,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,2.1.90,EDWARD,His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
10240,10241,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.1.91,RICHARD,"Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,"
10241,10242,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.1.92,RICHARD,Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
10242,10243,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.1.93,RICHARD,"For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say,"
10243,10244,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.1.94,RICHARD,"Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his."
10244,10245,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,,RICHARD,"March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army"
10245,10246,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,2.1.95,WARWICK,"How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?"
10246,10247,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.1.96,RICHARD,"Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount"
10247,10248,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.1.97,RICHARD,"Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance"
10248,10249,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.1.98,RICHARD,"Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,"
10249,10250,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.1.99,RICHARD,The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
10250,10251,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.1.100,RICHARD,"O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!"
10251,10252,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.1.101,EDWARD,"O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,"
10252,10253,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.1.102,EDWARD,"Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,"
10253,10254,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.1.103,EDWARD,Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
10254,10255,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.104,WARWICK,"Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears,"
10255,10256,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.105,WARWICK,"And now, to add more measure to your woes,"
10256,10257,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.106,WARWICK,I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
10257,10258,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.107,WARWICK,"After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,"
10258,10259,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.108,WARWICK,"Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,"
10259,10260,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.109,WARWICK,"Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,"
10260,10261,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.110,WARWICK,Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
10261,10262,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.111,WARWICK,"I, then in London keeper of the king,"
10262,10263,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.112,WARWICK,"Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,"
10263,10264,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.113,WARWICK,"And very well appointed, as I thought,"
10264,10265,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.114,WARWICK,"March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,"
10265,10266,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.115,WARWICK,"Bearing the king in my behalf along,"
10266,10267,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.116,WARWICK,For by my scouts I was advertised
10267,10268,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.117,WARWICK,That she was coming with a full intent
10268,10269,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.118,WARWICK,To dash our late decree in parliament
10269,10270,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.119,WARWICK,Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
10270,10271,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.120,WARWICK,"Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met"
10271,10272,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.121,WARWICK,"Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:"
10272,10273,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.122,WARWICK,"But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,"
10273,10274,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.123,WARWICK,"Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,"
10274,10275,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.124,WARWICK,"That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen,"
10275,10276,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.125,WARWICK,"Or whether 'twas report of her success,"
10276,10277,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.126,WARWICK,"Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,"
10277,10278,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.127,WARWICK,"Who thunders to his captives blood and death,"
10278,10279,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.128,WARWICK,"I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,"
10279,10280,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.129,WARWICK,"Their weapons like to lightning came and went,"
10280,10281,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.130,WARWICK,"Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,"
10281,10282,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.131,WARWICK,"Or like an idle thresher with a flail,"
10282,10283,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.132,WARWICK,"Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends."
10283,10284,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.133,WARWICK,"I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,"
10284,10285,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.134,WARWICK,With promise of high pay and great rewards:
10285,10286,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.135,WARWICK,"But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,"
10286,10287,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.136,WARWICK,"And we in them no hope to win the day,"
10287,10288,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.137,WARWICK,"So that we fled, the king unto the queen,"
10288,10289,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.138,WARWICK,"Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,"
10289,10290,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.139,WARWICK,"In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:"
10290,10291,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.140,WARWICK,"For in the marches here we heard you were,"
10291,10292,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.1.141,WARWICK,Making another head to fight again.
10292,10293,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,2.1.142,EDWARD,"Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?"
10293,10294,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,2.1.143,EDWARD,And when came George from Burgundy to England?
10294,10295,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,2.1.144,WARWICK,"Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers,"
10295,10296,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,2.1.145,WARWICK,"And for your brother, he was lately sent"
10296,10297,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,2.1.146,WARWICK,"From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,"
10297,10298,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,2.1.147,WARWICK,With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
10298,10299,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.1.148,RICHARD,"'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:"
10299,10300,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.1.149,RICHARD,"Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,"
10300,10301,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.1.150,RICHARD,But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
10301,10302,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.1.151,WARWICK,"Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear,"
10302,10303,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.1.152,WARWICK,For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
10303,10304,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.1.153,WARWICK,"Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,"
10304,10305,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.1.154,WARWICK,"And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,"
10305,10306,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.1.155,WARWICK,Were he as famous and as bold in war
10306,10307,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.1.156,WARWICK,"As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer."
10307,10308,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.157,RICHARD,"I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not:"
10308,10309,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.158,RICHARD,'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
10309,10310,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.159,RICHARD,But in this troublous time what's to be done?
10310,10311,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.160,RICHARD,"Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,"
10311,10312,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.161,RICHARD,"And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,"
10312,10313,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.162,RICHARD,Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
10313,10314,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.163,RICHARD,Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
10314,10315,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.164,RICHARD,Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
10315,10316,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.1.165,RICHARD,"If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords."
10316,10317,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.166,WARWICK,"Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,"
10317,10318,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.167,WARWICK,And therefore comes my brother Montague.
10318,10319,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.168,WARWICK,"Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,"
10319,10320,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.169,WARWICK,"With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,"
10320,10321,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.170,WARWICK,"And of their feather many more proud birds,"
10321,10322,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.171,WARWICK,Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
10322,10323,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.172,WARWICK,"He swore consent to your succession,"
10323,10324,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.173,WARWICK,"His oath enrolled in the parliament,"
10324,10325,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.174,WARWICK,"And now to London all the crew are gone,"
10325,10326,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.175,WARWICK,To frustrate both his oath and what beside
10326,10327,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.176,WARWICK,May make against the house of Lancaster.
10327,10328,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.177,WARWICK,"Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:"
10328,10329,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.178,WARWICK,"Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,"
10329,10330,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.179,WARWICK,"With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,"
10330,10331,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.180,WARWICK,"Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,"
10331,10332,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.181,WARWICK,"Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,"
10332,10333,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.182,WARWICK,"Why, Via! to London will we march amain,"
10333,10334,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.183,WARWICK,"And once again bestride our foaming steeds,"
10334,10335,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.184,WARWICK,And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
10335,10336,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.1.185,WARWICK,But never once again turn back and fly.
10336,10337,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.1.186,RICHARD,"Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:"
10337,10338,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.1.187,RICHARD,"Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,"
10338,10339,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.1.188,RICHARD,"That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay."
10339,10340,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,2.1.189,EDWARD,"Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,"
10340,10341,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,2.1.190,EDWARD,And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
10341,10342,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,2.1.191,EDWARD,"Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!"
10342,10343,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.192,WARWICK,"No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:"
10343,10344,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.193,WARWICK,"The next degree is England's royal throne,"
10344,10345,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.194,WARWICK,For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
10345,10346,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.195,WARWICK,"In every borough as we pass along,"
10346,10347,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.196,WARWICK,And he that throws not up his cap for joy
10347,10348,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.197,WARWICK,Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
10348,10349,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.198,WARWICK,"King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,"
10349,10350,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.199,WARWICK,"Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,"
10350,10351,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.1.200,WARWICK,"But sound the trumpets, and about our task."
10351,10352,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,2.1.201,RICHARD,"Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,"
10352,10353,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,2.1.202,RICHARD,"As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,"
10353,10354,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,2.1.203,RICHARD,"I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine."
10354,10355,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,2.1.204,EDWARD,Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
10355,10356,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,,EDWARD,Enter a Messenger
10356,10357,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,2.1.205,WARWICK,How now! what news?
10357,10358,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,2.1.206,Messenger,"The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,"
10358,10359,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,2.1.207,Messenger,"The queen is coming with a puissant host,"
10359,10360,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,2.1.208,Messenger,And craves your company for speedy counsel.
10360,10361,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,2.1.209,WARWICK,"Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away."
10361,10362,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,,WARWICK,Exeunt
10362,10363,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,,WARWICK,SCENE II. Before York.
10363,10364,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,,WARWICK,"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,  PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets"
10364,10365,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.2.1,QUEEN MARGARET,"Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York."
10365,10366,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.2.2,QUEEN MARGARET,Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
10366,10367,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.2.3,QUEEN MARGARET,That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
10367,10368,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.2.4,QUEEN MARGARET,"Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?"
10368,10369,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.2.5,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:"
10369,10370,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.2.6,KING HENRY VI,"To see this sight, it irks my very soul."
10370,10371,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.2.7,KING HENRY VI,"Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,"
10371,10372,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.2.8,KING HENRY VI,Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
10372,10373,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.9,CLIFFORD,"My gracious liege, this too much lenity"
10373,10374,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.10,CLIFFORD,And harmful pity must be laid aside.
10374,10375,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.11,CLIFFORD,To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
10375,10376,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.12,CLIFFORD,Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
10376,10377,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.13,CLIFFORD,Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
10377,10378,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.14,CLIFFORD,Not his that spoils her young before her face.
10378,10379,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.15,CLIFFORD,Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
10379,10380,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.16,CLIFFORD,Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
10380,10381,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.17,CLIFFORD,"The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,"
10381,10382,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.18,CLIFFORD,And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
10382,10383,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.19,CLIFFORD,"Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,"
10383,10384,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.20,CLIFFORD,Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
10384,10385,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.21,CLIFFORD,"He, but a duke, would have his son a king,"
10385,10386,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.22,CLIFFORD,"And raise his issue, like a loving sire,"
10386,10387,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.23,CLIFFORD,"Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,"
10387,10388,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.24,CLIFFORD,"Didst yield consent to disinherit him,"
10388,10389,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.25,CLIFFORD,Which argued thee a most unloving father.
10389,10390,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.26,CLIFFORD,"Unreasonable creatures feed their young,"
10390,10391,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.27,CLIFFORD,"And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,"
10391,10392,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.28,CLIFFORD,"Yet, in protection of their tender ones,"
10392,10393,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.29,CLIFFORD,"Who hath not seen them, even with those wings"
10393,10394,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.30,CLIFFORD,"Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,"
10394,10395,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.31,CLIFFORD,"Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,"
10395,10396,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.32,CLIFFORD,Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
10396,10397,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.33,CLIFFORD,"For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!"
10397,10398,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.34,CLIFFORD,Were it not pity that this goodly boy
10398,10399,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.35,CLIFFORD,"Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,"
10399,10400,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.36,CLIFFORD,"And long hereafter say unto his child,"
10400,10401,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.37,CLIFFORD,'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
10401,10402,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.38,CLIFFORD,My careless father fondly gave away'?
10402,10403,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.39,CLIFFORD,"Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,"
10403,10404,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.40,CLIFFORD,"And let his manly face, which promiseth"
10404,10405,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.41,CLIFFORD,"Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart"
10405,10406,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.2.42,CLIFFORD,To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
10406,10407,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.43,KING HENRY VI,"Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,"
10407,10408,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.44,KING HENRY VI,Inferring arguments of mighty force.
10408,10409,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.45,KING HENRY VI,"But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear"
10409,10410,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.46,KING HENRY VI,That things ill-got had ever bad success?
10410,10411,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.47,KING HENRY VI,And happy always was it for that son
10411,10412,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.48,KING HENRY VI,Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
10412,10413,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.49,KING HENRY VI,"I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,"
10413,10414,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.50,KING HENRY VI,And would my father had left me no more!
10414,10415,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.51,KING HENRY VI,For all the rest is held at such a rate
10415,10416,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.52,KING HENRY VI,As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
10416,10417,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.53,KING HENRY VI,Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
10417,10418,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.54,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know"
10418,10419,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.2.55,KING HENRY VI,How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
10419,10420,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.2.56,QUEEN MARGARET,"My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,"
10420,10421,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.2.57,QUEEN MARGARET,And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
10421,10422,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.2.58,QUEEN MARGARET,You promised knighthood to our forward son:
10422,10423,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.2.59,QUEEN MARGARET,"Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently."
10423,10424,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.2.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward, kneel down."
10424,10425,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.2.61,KING HENRY VI,"Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,"
10425,10426,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.2.62,KING HENRY VI,"And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right."
10426,10427,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.2.63,PRINCE,"My gracious father, by your kingly leave,"
10427,10428,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.2.64,PRINCE,"I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,"
10428,10429,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.2.65,PRINCE,And in that quarrel use it to the death.
10429,10430,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,2.2.66,CLIFFORD,"Why, that is spoken like a toward prince."
10430,10431,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,,CLIFFORD,Enter a Messenger
10431,10432,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.2.67,Messenger,"Royal commanders, be in readiness:"
10432,10433,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.2.68,Messenger,For with a band of thirty thousand men
10433,10434,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.2.69,Messenger,"Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York,"
10434,10435,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.2.70,Messenger,"And in the towns, as they do march along,"
10435,10436,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.2.71,Messenger,"Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:"
10436,10437,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.2.72,Messenger,"Darraign your battle, for they are at hand."
10437,10438,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.2.73,CLIFFORD,I would your highness would depart the field:
10438,10439,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.2.74,CLIFFORD,The queen hath best success when you are absent.
10439,10440,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.2.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune."
10440,10441,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.2.76,KING HENRY VI,"Why, that's my fortune too, therefore I'll stay."
10441,10442,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,2.2.77,NORTHUMBERLAND,Be it with resolution then to fight.
10442,10443,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.2.78,PRINCE EDWARD,"My royal father, cheer these noble lords"
10443,10444,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.2.79,PRINCE EDWARD,And hearten those that fight in your defence:
10444,10445,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.2.80,PRINCE EDWARD,"Unsheathe your sword, good father, cry 'Saint George!'"
10445,10446,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,,PRINCE EDWARD,"March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers"
10446,10447,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,2.2.81,EDWARD,"Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,"
10447,10448,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,2.2.82,EDWARD,"And set thy diadem upon my head,"
10448,10449,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,2.2.83,EDWARD,Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
10449,10450,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.2.84,QUEEN MARGARET,"Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!"
10450,10451,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.2.85,QUEEN MARGARET,Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
10451,10452,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.2.86,QUEEN MARGARET,Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
10452,10453,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.2.87,EDWARD,"I am his king, and he should bow his knee,"
10453,10454,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.2.88,EDWARD,I was adopted heir by his consent:
10454,10455,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.2.89,EDWARD,"Since when, his oath is broke, for, as I hear,"
10455,10456,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.2.90,EDWARD,"You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,"
10456,10457,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.2.91,EDWARD,"Have caused him, by new act of parliament,"
10457,10458,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.2.92,EDWARD,"To blot out me, and put his own son in."
10458,10459,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.2.93,CLIFFORD,And reason too:
10459,10460,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.2.94,CLIFFORD,Who should succeed the father but the son?
10460,10461,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,2.2.95,RICHARD,"Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!"
10461,10462,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,2.2.96,CLIFFORD,"Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,"
10462,10463,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,2.2.97,CLIFFORD,Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
10463,10464,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.2.98,RICHARD,"'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?"
10464,10465,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.2.99,CLIFFORD,"Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied."
10465,10466,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.2.100,RICHARD,"For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight."
10466,10467,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.2.101,WARWICK,"What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?"
10467,10468,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.2.102,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?"
10468,10469,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.2.103,QUEEN MARGARET,"When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,"
10469,10470,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.2.104,QUEEN MARGARET,Your legs did better service than your hands.
10470,10471,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,2.2.105,WARWICK,"Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine."
10471,10472,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,2.2.106,CLIFFORD,"You said so much before, and yet you fled."
10472,10473,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,2.2.107,WARWICK,"'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence."
10473,10474,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,2.2.108,NORTHUMBERLAND,"No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay."
10474,10475,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,2.2.109,RICHARD,"Northumberland, I hold thee reverently."
10475,10476,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,2.2.110,RICHARD,"Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain"
10476,10477,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,2.2.111,RICHARD,The execution of my big-swoln heart
10477,10478,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,2.2.112,RICHARD,"Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer."
10478,10479,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,2.2.113,CLIFFORD,"I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?"
10479,10480,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,2.2.114,RICHARD,"Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,"
10480,10481,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,2.2.115,RICHARD,"As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland,"
10481,10482,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,2.2.116,RICHARD,But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
10482,10483,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,2.2.117,KING HENRY VI,"Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak."
10483,10484,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,2.2.118,QUEEN MARGARET,"Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips."
10484,10485,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,2.2.119,KING HENRY VI,"I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:"
10485,10486,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,2.2.120,KING HENRY VI,"I am a king, and privileged to speak."
10486,10487,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,2.2.121,CLIFFORD,"My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here"
10487,10488,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,2.2.122,CLIFFORD,"Cannot be cured by words, therefore be still."
10488,10489,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,2.2.123,RICHARD,"Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:"
10489,10490,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,2.2.124,RICHARD,"By him that made us all, I am resolved"
10490,10491,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,2.2.125,RICHARD,that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
10491,10492,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,2.2.126,EDWARD,"Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?"
10492,10493,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,2.2.127,EDWARD,"A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,"
10493,10494,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,2.2.128,EDWARD,That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
10494,10495,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,2.2.129,WARWICK,"If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,"
10495,10496,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,2.2.130,WARWICK,For York in justice puts his armour on.
10496,10497,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,2.2.131,PRINCE EDWARD,"If that be right which Warwick says is right,"
10497,10498,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,2.2.132,PRINCE EDWARD,"There is no wrong, but every thing is right."
10498,10499,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,2.2.133,RICHARD,"Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,"
10499,10500,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,2.2.134,RICHARD,"For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue."
10500,10501,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,2.2.135,QUEEN MARGARET,"But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,"
10501,10502,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,2.2.136,QUEEN MARGARET,"But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,"
10502,10503,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,2.2.137,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,"
10503,10504,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,2.2.138,QUEEN MARGARET,"As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings."
10504,10505,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,2.2.139,RICHARD,"Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,"
10505,10506,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,2.2.140,RICHARD,"Whose father bears the title of a king,--"
10506,10507,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,2.2.141,RICHARD,"As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--"
10507,10508,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,2.2.142,RICHARD,"Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,"
10508,10509,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,2.2.143,RICHARD,To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
10509,10510,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.144,EDWARD,"A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,"
10510,10511,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.145,EDWARD,To make this shameless callet know herself.
10511,10512,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.146,EDWARD,"Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,"
10512,10513,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.147,EDWARD,"Although thy husband may be Menelaus,"
10513,10514,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.148,EDWARD,And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
10514,10515,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.149,EDWARD,"By that false woman, as this king by thee."
10515,10516,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.150,EDWARD,"His father revell'd in the heart of France,"
10516,10517,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.151,EDWARD,"And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop,"
10517,10518,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.152,EDWARD,"And had he match'd according to his state,"
10518,10519,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.153,EDWARD,"He might have kept that glory to this day,"
10519,10520,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.154,EDWARD,"But when he took a beggar to his bed,"
10520,10521,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.155,EDWARD,"And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,"
10521,10522,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.156,EDWARD,"Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,"
10522,10523,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.157,EDWARD,"That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,"
10523,10524,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.158,EDWARD,And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
10524,10525,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.159,EDWARD,For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
10525,10526,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.160,EDWARD,"Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,"
10526,10527,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.161,EDWARD,"And we, in pity of the gentle king,"
10527,10528,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,2.2.162,EDWARD,Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
10528,10529,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,2.2.163,GEORGE,"But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,"
10529,10530,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,2.2.164,GEORGE,"And that thy summer bred us no increase,"
10530,10531,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,2.2.165,GEORGE,"We set the axe to thy usurping root,"
10531,10532,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,2.2.166,GEORGE,"And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,"
10532,10533,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,2.2.167,GEORGE,"Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,"
10533,10534,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,2.2.168,GEORGE,"We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,"
10534,10535,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,2.2.169,GEORGE,Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
10535,10536,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,2.2.170,EDWARD,"And, in this resolution, I defy thee,"
10536,10537,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,2.2.171,EDWARD,"Not willing any longer conference,"
10537,10538,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,2.2.172,EDWARD,Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
10538,10539,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,2.2.173,EDWARD,Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
10539,10540,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,2.2.174,EDWARD,"And either victory, or else a grave."
10540,10541,Henry VI Part 3,47.0,2.2.175,QUEEN MARGARET,"Stay, Edward."
10541,10542,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,2.2.176,EDWARD,"No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:"
10542,10543,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,2.2.177,EDWARD,These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
10543,10544,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,,EDWARD,Exeunt
10544,10545,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,,EDWARD,"SCENE III. A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in"

10546,10547,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,,EDWARD,Alarum. Excursions. Enter WARWICK
10547,10548,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.3.2,WARWICK,"Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,"
10548,10549,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.3.3,WARWICK,"I lay me down a little while to breathe,"
10549,10550,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.3.4,WARWICK,"For strokes received, and many blows repaid,"
10550,10551,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.3.5,WARWICK,"Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,"
10551,10552,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.3.6,WARWICK,And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
10552,10553,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,WARWICK,"Enter EDWARD, running"
10553,10554,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.3.7,EDWARD,"Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!"
10554,10555,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.3.8,EDWARD,"For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded."
10555,10556,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.3.9,WARWICK,"How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?"
10556,10557,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,,WARWICK,Enter GEORGE
10557,10558,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.3.10,GEORGE,"Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair,"
10558,10559,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.3.11,GEORGE,"Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:"
10559,10560,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.3.12,GEORGE,What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?
10560,10561,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.3.13,EDWARD,"Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings,"
10561,10562,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.3.14,EDWARD,And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
10562,10563,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,,EDWARD,Enter RICHARD
10563,10564,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.15,RICHARD,"Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?"
10564,10565,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.16,RICHARD,"Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,"
10565,10566,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.17,RICHARD,"Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance,"
10566,10567,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.18,RICHARD,"And in the very pangs of death he cried,"
10567,10568,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.19,RICHARD,"Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,"
10568,10569,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.20,RICHARD,"'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'"
10569,10570,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.21,RICHARD,"So, underneath the belly of their steeds,"
10570,10571,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.22,RICHARD,"That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,"
10571,10572,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.3.23,RICHARD,The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
10572,10573,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.3.24,WARWICK,Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
10573,10574,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.3.25,WARWICK,"I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly."
10574,10575,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.3.26,WARWICK,"Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,"
10575,10576,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.3.27,WARWICK,"Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage,"
10576,10577,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.3.28,WARWICK,"And look upon, as if the tragedy"
10577,10578,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.3.29,WARWICK,Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
10578,10579,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.3.30,WARWICK,"Here on my knee I vow to God above,"

10665,10666,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.5.40,KING HENRY VI,Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.

10757,10758,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,2.5.127,PRINCE EDWARD,Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
10758,10759,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.5.128,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mount you, my lord, towards Berwick post amain:"
10759,10760,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.5.129,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds"
10760,10761,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.5.130,QUEEN MARGARET,"Having the fearful flying hare in sight,"
10761,10762,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.5.131,QUEEN MARGARET,"With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,"
10762,10763,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.5.132,QUEEN MARGARET,"And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,"
10763,10764,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.5.133,QUEEN MARGARET,"Are at our backs, and therefore hence amain."
10764,10765,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.5.134,EXETER,Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
10765,10766,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.5.135,EXETER,"Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed,"
10766,10767,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.5.136,EXETER,Or else come after: I'll away before.
10767,10768,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.5.137,KING HENRY VI,"Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:"
10768,10769,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.5.138,KING HENRY VI,"Not that I fear to stay, but love to go"
10769,10770,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.5.139,KING HENRY VI,"Whither the queen intends. Forward, away!"
10770,10771,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,,KING HENRY VI,Exeunt
10771,10772,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,,KING HENRY VI,SCENE VI. Another part of the field.
10772,10773,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,,KING HENRY VI,"A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded"
10773,10774,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.1,CLIFFORD,"Here burns my candle out, ay, here it dies,"
10774,10775,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.2,CLIFFORD,"Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light."
10775,10776,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.3,CLIFFORD,"O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow"
10776,10777,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.4,CLIFFORD,More than my body's parting with my soul!
10777,10778,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.5,CLIFFORD,"My love and fear glued many friends to thee,"
10778,10779,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.6,CLIFFORD,"And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts."
10779,10780,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.7,CLIFFORD,"Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,"
10780,10781,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.8,CLIFFORD,"The common people swarm like summer flies,"
10781,10782,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.9,CLIFFORD,And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
10782,10783,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.10,CLIFFORD,And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
10783,10784,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.11,CLIFFORD,"O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent"
10784,10785,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.12,CLIFFORD,"That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,"
10785,10786,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.13,CLIFFORD,Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
10786,10787,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.14,CLIFFORD,"And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,"
10787,10788,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.15,CLIFFORD,"Or as thy father and his father did,"
10788,10789,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.16,CLIFFORD,"Giving no ground unto the house of York,"
10789,10790,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.17,CLIFFORD,"They never then had sprung like summer flies,"
10790,10791,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.18,CLIFFORD,I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
10791,10792,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.19,CLIFFORD,"Had left no mourning widows for our death,"
10792,10793,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.20,CLIFFORD,And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
10793,10794,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.21,CLIFFORD,For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
10794,10795,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.22,CLIFFORD,And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
10795,10796,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.23,CLIFFORD,"Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds,"
10796,10797,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.24,CLIFFORD,"No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:"
10797,10798,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.25,CLIFFORD,"The foe is merciless, and will not pity,"
10798,10799,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.26,CLIFFORD,For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
10799,10800,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.27,CLIFFORD,"The air hath got into my deadly wounds,"
10800,10801,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.28,CLIFFORD,And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
10801,10802,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.29,CLIFFORD,"Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest,"
10802,10803,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,2.6.30,CLIFFORD,"I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast."
10803,10804,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,CLIFFORD,He faints
10804,10805,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,CLIFFORD,"Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers"
10805,10806,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.6.31,EDWARD,"Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,"
10806,10807,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.6.32,EDWARD,And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
10807,10808,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.6.33,EDWARD,"Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,"
10808,10809,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.6.34,EDWARD,"That led calm Henry, though he were a king,"
10809,10810,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.6.35,EDWARD,"As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,"
10810,10811,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.6.36,EDWARD,Command an argosy to stem the waves.
10811,10812,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,2.6.37,EDWARD,"But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?"
10812,10813,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.6.38,WARWICK,"No, 'tis impossible he should escape,"
10813,10814,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.6.39,WARWICK,"For, though before his face I speak the words"
10814,10815,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.6.40,WARWICK,Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
10815,10816,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,2.6.41,WARWICK,"And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead."
10816,10817,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,,WARWICK,"CLIFFORD groans, and dies"
10817,10818,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,2.6.42,EDWARD,Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
10818,10819,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,2.6.43,RICHARD,"A deadly groan, like life and death's departing."
10819,10820,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.6.44,EDWARD,"See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,"
10820,10821,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,2.6.45,EDWARD,"If friend or foe, let him be gently used."
10821,10822,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.6.46,RICHARD,"Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford,"
10822,10823,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.6.47,RICHARD,Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
10823,10824,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.6.48,RICHARD,"In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,"
10824,10825,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.6.49,RICHARD,But set his murdering knife unto the root
10825,10826,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.6.50,RICHARD,"From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,"
10826,10827,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,2.6.51,RICHARD,"I mean our princely father, Duke of York."
10827,10828,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,2.6.52,WARWICK,"From off the gates of York fetch down the head,"
10828,10829,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,2.6.53,WARWICK,"Your father's head, which Clifford placed there,"
10829,10830,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,2.6.54,WARWICK,Instead whereof let this supply the room:
10830,10831,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,2.6.55,WARWICK,Measure for measure must be answered.
10831,10832,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.6.56,EDWARD,"Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,"
10832,10833,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.6.57,EDWARD,That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
10833,10834,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.6.58,EDWARD,"Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,"
10834,10835,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,2.6.59,EDWARD,And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
10835,10836,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.6.60,WARWICK,I think his understanding is bereft.
10836,10837,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.6.61,WARWICK,"Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?"
10837,10838,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.6.62,WARWICK,"Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,"
10838,10839,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,2.6.63,WARWICK,And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
10839,10840,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.6.64,RICHARD,"O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:"
10840,10841,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.6.65,RICHARD,"'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,"
10841,10842,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.6.66,RICHARD,Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
10842,10843,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,2.6.67,RICHARD,Which in the time of death he gave our father.
10843,10844,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,2.6.68,GEORGE,"If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words."
10844,10845,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,2.6.69,RICHARD,"Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace."
10845,10846,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,2.6.70,EDWARD,"Clifford, repent in bootless penitence."
10846,10847,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,2.6.71,WARWICK,"Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults."
10847,10848,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,2.6.72,GEORGE,While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
10848,10849,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,2.6.73,RICHARD,"Thou didst love York, and I am son to York."
10849,10850,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,2.6.74,EDWARD,"Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee."
10850,10851,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,2.6.75,GEORGE,"Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?"
10851,10852,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,2.6.76,WARWICK,"They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont."
10852,10853,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.77,RICHARD,"What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard"
10853,10854,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.78,RICHARD,When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
10854,10855,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.79,RICHARD,"I know by that he's dead, and, by my soul,"
10855,10856,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.80,RICHARD,"If this right hand would buy two hour's life,"
10856,10857,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.81,RICHARD,"That I in all despite might rail at him,"
10857,10858,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.82,RICHARD,"This hand should chop it off, and with the"
10858,10859,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.83,RICHARD,issuing blood
10859,10860,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.84,RICHARD,Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
10860,10861,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,2.6.85,RICHARD,York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
10861,10862,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.86,WARWICK,"Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,"
10862,10863,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.87,WARWICK,And rear it in the place your father's stands.
10863,10864,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.88,WARWICK,"And now to London with triumphant march,"
10864,10865,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.89,WARWICK,There to be crowned England's royal king:
10865,10866,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.90,WARWICK,"From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,"
10866,10867,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.91,WARWICK,And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
10867,10868,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.92,WARWICK,"So shalt thou sinew both these lands together,"
10868,10869,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.93,WARWICK,"And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread"
10869,10870,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.94,WARWICK,"The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again,"
10870,10871,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.95,WARWICK,"For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,"
10871,10872,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.96,WARWICK,Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
10872,10873,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.97,WARWICK,"First will I see the coronation,"
10873,10874,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.98,WARWICK,"And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,"
10874,10875,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,2.6.99,WARWICK,"To effect this marriage, so it please my lord."
10875,10876,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.6.100,EDWARD,"Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be,"
10876,10877,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.6.101,EDWARD,"For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,"
10877,10878,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.6.102,EDWARD,And never will I undertake the thing
10878,10879,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.6.103,EDWARD,Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
10879,10880,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.6.104,EDWARD,"Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,"
10880,10881,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.6.105,EDWARD,"And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,"
10881,10882,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,2.6.106,EDWARD,Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
10882,10883,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.6.107,RICHARD,"Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,"
10883,10884,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,2.6.108,RICHARD,For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
10884,10885,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.6.109,WARWICK,"Tut, that's a foolish observation:"
10885,10886,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.6.110,WARWICK,"Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,"
10886,10887,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,2.6.111,WARWICK,To see these honours in possession.
10887,10888,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,WARWICK,Exeunt
10888,10889,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,WARWICK,ACT III
10889,10890,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,WARWICK,SCENE I. A forest in the north of England.
10890,10891,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,WARWICK,"Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands"
10891,10892,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.1.1,First Keeper,"Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,"
10892,10893,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.1.2,First Keeper,"For through this laund anon the deer will come,"
10893,10894,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.1.3,First Keeper,"And in this covert will we make our stand,"
10894,10895,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.1.4,First Keeper,Culling the principal of all the deer.
10895,10896,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.1.5,Second Keeper,"I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot."
10896,10897,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.1.6,First Keeper,"That cannot be, the noise of thy cross-bow"
10897,10898,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.1.7,First Keeper,"Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost."
10898,10899,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.1.8,First Keeper,"Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:"
10899,10900,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.1.9,First Keeper,"And, for the time shall not seem tedious,"
10900,10901,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.1.10,First Keeper,I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
10901,10902,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.1.11,First Keeper,In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
10902,10903,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,3.1.12,Second Keeper,"Here comes a man, let's stay till he be past."
10903,10904,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,,Second Keeper,"Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook"
10904,10905,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.13,KING HENRY VI,"From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,"
10905,10906,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.14,KING HENRY VI,To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
10906,10907,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.15,KING HENRY VI,"No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine,"
10907,10908,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.16,KING HENRY VI,"Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,"
10908,10909,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.17,KING HENRY VI,Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
10909,10910,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.18,KING HENRY VI,"No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,"
10910,10911,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.19,KING HENRY VI,"No humble suitors press to speak for right,"
10911,10912,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.20,KING HENRY VI,"No, not a man comes for redress of thee,"
10912,10913,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.1.21,KING HENRY VI,"For how can I help them, and not myself?"
10913,10914,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.1.22,First Keeper,"Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:"
10914,10915,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.1.23,First Keeper,"This is the quondam king, let's seize upon him."
10915,10916,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,3.1.24,KING HENRY VI,"Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,"
10916,10917,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,3.1.25,KING HENRY VI,For wise men say it is the wisest course.
10917,10918,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,3.1.26,Second Keeper,Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
10918,10919,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,3.1.27,First Keeper,"Forbear awhile, we'll hear a little more."
10919,10920,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.28,KING HENRY VI,"My queen and son are gone to France for aid,"
10920,10921,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.29,KING HENRY VI,"And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick"
10921,10922,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.30,KING HENRY VI,"Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister"
10922,10923,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.31,KING HENRY VI,"To wife for Edward: if this news be true,"
10923,10924,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.32,KING HENRY VI,"Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost,"
10924,10925,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.33,KING HENRY VI,"For Warwick is a subtle orator,"
10925,10926,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.34,KING HENRY VI,And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
10926,10927,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.35,KING HENRY VI,"By this account then Margaret may win him,"
10927,10928,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.36,KING HENRY VI,For she's a woman to be pitied much:
10928,10929,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.37,KING HENRY VI,"Her sighs will make a battery in his breast,"
10929,10930,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.38,KING HENRY VI,"Her tears will pierce into a marble heart,"
10930,10931,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.39,KING HENRY VI,"The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn,"
10931,10932,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.40,KING HENRY VI,"And Nero will be tainted with remorse,"
10932,10933,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.41,KING HENRY VI,"To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears."
10933,10934,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.42,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give,"
10934,10935,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.43,KING HENRY VI,"She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,"
10935,10936,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.44,KING HENRY VI,"He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward."
10936,10937,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.45,KING HENRY VI,"She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed,"
10937,10938,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.46,KING HENRY VI,"He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd,"
10938,10939,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.47,KING HENRY VI,"That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more,"
10939,10940,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.48,KING HENRY VI,"Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,"
10940,10941,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.49,KING HENRY VI,"Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,"
10941,10942,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.50,KING HENRY VI,"And in conclusion wins the king from her,"
10942,10943,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.51,KING HENRY VI,"With promise of his sister, and what else,"
10943,10944,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.52,KING HENRY VI,To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
10944,10945,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.53,KING HENRY VI,"O Margaret, thus 'twill be, and thou, poor soul,"
10945,10946,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.1.54,KING HENRY VI,"Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!"
10946,10947,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,3.1.55,Second Keeper,"Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?"
10947,10948,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,3.1.56,KING HENRY VI,"More than I seem, and less than I was born to:"
10948,10949,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,3.1.57,KING HENRY VI,"A man at least, for less I should not be,"
10949,10950,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,3.1.58,KING HENRY VI,"And men may talk of kings, and why not I?"
10950,10951,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,3.1.59,Second Keeper,"Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king."
10951,10952,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,3.1.60,KING HENRY VI,"Why, so I am, in mind, and that's enough."
10952,10953,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.1.61,Second Keeper,"But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?"
10953,10954,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,3.1.62,KING HENRY VI,"My crown is in my heart, not on my head,"
10954,10955,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,3.1.63,KING HENRY VI,"Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,"
10955,10956,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,3.1.64,KING HENRY VI,Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
10956,10957,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,3.1.65,KING HENRY VI,A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
10957,10958,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.1.66,Second Keeper,"Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,"
10958,10959,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.1.67,Second Keeper,Your crown content and you must be contented
10959,10960,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.1.68,Second Keeper,"To go along with us, for as we think,"
10960,10961,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.1.69,Second Keeper,"You are the king King Edward hath deposed,"
10961,10962,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.1.70,Second Keeper,And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
10962,10963,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.1.71,Second Keeper,Will apprehend you as his enemy.
10963,10964,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.1.72,KING HENRY VI,"But did you never swear, and break an oath?"
10964,10965,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,3.1.73,Second Keeper,"No, never such an oath, nor will not now."
10965,10966,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,3.1.74,KING HENRY VI,Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
10966,10967,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,3.1.75,Second Keeper,"Here in this country, where we now remain."
10967,10968,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.1.76,KING HENRY VI,"I was anointed king at nine months old,"
10968,10969,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.1.77,KING HENRY VI,"My father and my grandfather were kings,"
10969,10970,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.1.78,KING HENRY VI,And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
10970,10971,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.1.79,KING HENRY VI,"And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?"
10971,10972,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.1.80,First Keeper,"No,"
10972,10973,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.1.81,First Keeper,For we were subjects but while you were king.
10973,10974,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.82,KING HENRY VI,"Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?"
10974,10975,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.83,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!"
10975,10976,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"Look, as I blow this feather from my face,"
10976,10977,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"And as the air blows it to me again,"
10977,10978,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.86,KING HENRY VI,"Obeying with my wind when I do blow,"
10978,10979,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.87,KING HENRY VI,"And yielding to another when it blows,"
10979,10980,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.88,KING HENRY VI,"Commanded always by the greater gust,"
10980,10981,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.89,KING HENRY VI,Such is the lightness of you common men.
10981,10982,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.90,KING HENRY VI,"But do not break your oaths, for of that sin"
10982,10983,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.91,KING HENRY VI,My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
10983,10984,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.92,KING HENRY VI,"Go where you will, the king shall be commanded,"
10984,10985,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.1.93,KING HENRY VI,"And be you kings, command, and I'll obey."
10985,10986,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,3.1.94,First Keeper,"We are true subjects to the king, King Edward."
10986,10987,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.1.95,KING HENRY VI,"So would you be again to Henry,"
10987,10988,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.1.96,KING HENRY VI,If he were seated as King Edward is.
10988,10989,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,3.1.97,First Keeper,"We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,"
10989,10990,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,3.1.98,First Keeper,To go with us unto the officers.
10990,10991,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,3.1.99,KING HENRY VI,"In God's name, lead, your king's name be obey'd:"
10991,10992,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,3.1.100,KING HENRY VI,"And what God will, that let your king perform,"
10992,10993,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,3.1.101,KING HENRY VI,"And what he will, I humbly yield unto."
10993,10994,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,,KING HENRY VI,Exeunt
10994,10995,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,,KING HENRY VI,SCENE II. London. The palace.
10995,10996,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,,KING HENRY VI,"Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY"
10996,10997,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.2.1,KING EDWARD IV,"Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field"
10997,10998,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.2.2,KING EDWARD IV,"This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,"
10998,10999,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.2.3,KING EDWARD IV,His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
10999,11000,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.2.4,KING EDWARD IV,"Her suit is now to repossess those lands,"
11000,11001,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.2.5,KING EDWARD IV,"Which we in justice cannot well deny,"
11001,11002,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.2.6,KING EDWARD IV,Because in quarrel of the house of York
11002,11003,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.2.7,KING EDWARD IV,The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
11003,11004,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.2.8,GLOUCESTER,"Your highness shall do well to grant her suit,"
11004,11005,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.2.9,GLOUCESTER,It were dishonour to deny it her.
11005,11006,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.2.10,KING EDWARD IV,"It were no less, but yet I'll make a pause."
11006,11007,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,3.2.11,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so?"
11007,11008,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,3.2.12,GLOUCESTER,"I see the lady hath a thing to grant,"
11008,11009,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,3.2.13,GLOUCESTER,Before the king will grant her humble suit.
11009,11010,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.2.14,CLARENCE,[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true
11010,11011,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.2.15,CLARENCE,he keeps the wind!
11011,11012,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.2.16,GLOUCESTER,[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!
11012,11013,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,3.2.17,KING EDWARD IV,"Widow, we will consider of your suit,"
11013,11014,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,3.2.18,KING EDWARD IV,And come some other time to know our mind.
11014,11015,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,3.2.19,LADY GREY,"Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:"
11015,11016,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,3.2.20,LADY GREY,"May it please your highness to resolve me now,"
11016,11017,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,3.2.21,LADY GREY,"And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me."
11017,11018,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,3.2.22,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant"
11018,11019,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,3.2.23,GLOUCESTER,"you all your lands,"
11019,11020,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,3.2.24,GLOUCESTER,An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
11020,11021,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,3.2.25,GLOUCESTER,"Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow."
11021,11022,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.2.26,CLARENCE,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she"
11022,11023,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.2.27,CLARENCE,chance to fall.
11023,11024,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,3.2.28,GLOUCESTER,[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
11024,11025,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,3.2.29,GLOUCESTER,take vantages.
11025,11026,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,3.2.30,KING EDWARD IV,"How many children hast thou, widow? tell me."
11026,11027,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,3.2.31,CLARENCE,[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a
11027,11028,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,3.2.32,CLARENCE,child of her.
11028,11029,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,3.2.33,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather"
11029,11030,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,3.2.34,GLOUCESTER,give her two.
11030,11031,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.2.35,LADY GREY,"Three, my most gracious lord."
11031,11032,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,3.2.36,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll"
11032,11033,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,3.2.37,GLOUCESTER,be ruled by him.
11033,11034,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.2.38,KING EDWARD IV,'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
11034,11035,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.2.39,LADY GREY,"Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then."
11035,11036,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,3.2.40,KING EDWARD IV,"Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit."
11036,11037,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,3.2.41,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you, for"
11037,11038,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,3.2.42,GLOUCESTER,"you will have leave,"
11038,11039,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,3.2.43,GLOUCESTER,Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.
11039,11040,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,,GLOUCESTER,GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
11040,11041,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,3.2.44,KING EDWARD IV,"Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?"
11041,11042,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.2.45,LADY GREY,"Ay, full as dearly as I love myself."
11042,11043,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.2.46,KING EDWARD IV,And would you not do much to do them good?
11043,11044,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.2.47,LADY GREY,"To do them good, I would sustain some harm."
11044,11045,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,3.2.48,KING EDWARD IV,"Then get your husband's lands, to do them good."
11045,11046,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.2.49,LADY GREY,Therefore I came unto your majesty.
11046,11047,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,3.2.50,KING EDWARD IV,I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
11047,11048,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,3.2.51,LADY GREY,So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
11048,11049,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,3.2.52,KING EDWARD IV,"What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?"
11049,11050,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,3.2.53,LADY GREY,"What you command, that rests in me to do."
11050,11051,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,3.2.54,KING EDWARD IV,But you will take exceptions to my boon.
11051,11052,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,3.2.55,LADY GREY,"No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it."
11052,11053,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,3.2.56,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask."
11053,11054,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,3.2.57,LADY GREY,"Why, then I will do what your grace commands."
11054,11055,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.2.58,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard, and much rain"
11055,11056,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.2.59,GLOUCESTER,wears the marble.
11056,11057,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,3.2.60,CLARENCE,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then"
11057,11058,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,3.2.61,CLARENCE,her wax must melt.
11058,11059,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,3.2.62,LADY GREY,"Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?"
11059,11060,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,3.2.63,KING EDWARD IV,"An easy task, 'tis but to love a king."
11060,11061,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,3.2.64,LADY GREY,"That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject."
11061,11062,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,3.2.65,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee."
11062,11063,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.2.66,LADY GREY,I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
11063,11064,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,3.2.67,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made, she seals it"
11064,11065,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,3.2.68,GLOUCESTER,with a curtsy.
11065,11066,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,3.2.69,KING EDWARD IV,"But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean."
11066,11067,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,3.2.70,LADY GREY,"The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege."
11067,11068,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,3.2.71,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense."
11068,11069,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,3.2.72,KING EDWARD IV,"What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?"
11069,11070,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,3.2.73,LADY GREY,"My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers,"
11070,11071,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,3.2.74,LADY GREY,That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
11071,11072,Henry VI Part 3,47.0,3.2.75,KING EDWARD IV,"No, by my troth, I did not mean such love."
11072,11073,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,3.2.76,LADY GREY,"Why, then you mean not as I thought you did."
11073,11074,Henry VI Part 3,49.0,3.2.77,KING EDWARD IV,But now you partly may perceive my mind.
11074,11075,Henry VI Part 3,50.0,3.2.78,LADY GREY,My mind will never grant what I perceive
11075,11076,Henry VI Part 3,50.0,3.2.79,LADY GREY,"Your highness aims at, if I aim aright."
11076,11077,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,3.2.80,KING EDWARD IV,"To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee."
11077,11078,Henry VI Part 3,52.0,3.2.81,LADY GREY,"To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison."
11078,11079,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.2.82,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands."
11079,11080,Henry VI Part 3,54.0,3.2.83,LADY GREY,"Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower,"
11080,11081,Henry VI Part 3,54.0,3.2.84,LADY GREY,For by that loss I will not purchase them.
11081,11082,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.2.85,KING EDWARD IV,Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
11082,11083,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,3.2.86,LADY GREY,Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
11083,11084,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,3.2.87,LADY GREY,"But, mighty lord, this merry inclination"
11084,11085,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,3.2.88,LADY GREY,Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
11085,11086,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,3.2.89,LADY GREY,Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
11086,11087,Henry VI Part 3,57.0,3.2.90,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request,"
11087,11088,Henry VI Part 3,57.0,3.2.91,KING EDWARD IV,No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
11088,11089,Henry VI Part 3,58.0,3.2.92,LADY GREY,"Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end."
11089,11090,Henry VI Part 3,59.0,3.2.93,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she"
11090,11091,Henry VI Part 3,59.0,3.2.94,GLOUCESTER,knits her brows.
11091,11092,Henry VI Part 3,60.0,3.2.95,CLARENCE,[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in
11092,11093,Henry VI Part 3,60.0,3.2.96,CLARENCE,Christendom.
11093,11094,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,3.2.97,KING EDWARD IV,"[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty,"
11094,11095,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,3.2.98,KING EDWARD IV,"Her words do show her wit incomparable,"
11095,11096,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,3.2.99,KING EDWARD IV,All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
11096,11097,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,3.2.100,KING EDWARD IV,"One way or other, she is for a king,"
11097,11098,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,3.2.101,KING EDWARD IV,"And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--"
11098,11099,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,3.2.102,KING EDWARD IV,Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
11099,11100,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.2.103,LADY GREY,"'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:"
11100,11101,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.2.104,LADY GREY,"I am a subject fit to jest withal,"
11101,11102,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.2.105,LADY GREY,But far unfit to be a sovereign.
11102,11103,Henry VI Part 3,63.0,3.2.106,KING EDWARD IV,"Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee"
11103,11104,Henry VI Part 3,63.0,3.2.107,KING EDWARD IV,"I speak no more than what my soul intends,"
11104,11105,Henry VI Part 3,63.0,3.2.108,KING EDWARD IV,"And that is, to enjoy thee for my love."
11105,11106,Henry VI Part 3,64.0,3.2.109,LADY GREY,And that is more than I will yield unto:
11106,11107,Henry VI Part 3,64.0,3.2.110,LADY GREY,"I know I am too mean to be your queen,"
11107,11108,Henry VI Part 3,64.0,3.2.111,LADY GREY,And yet too good to be your concubine.
11108,11109,Henry VI Part 3,65.0,3.2.112,KING EDWARD IV,"You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen."
11109,11110,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.2.113,LADY GREY,'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
11110,11111,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.2.114,KING EDWARD IV,No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
11111,11112,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.2.115,KING EDWARD IV,"Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children,"
11112,11113,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.2.116,KING EDWARD IV,"And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,"
11113,11114,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.2.117,KING EDWARD IV,"Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing"
11114,11115,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.2.118,KING EDWARD IV,To be the father unto many sons.
11115,11116,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.2.119,KING EDWARD IV,"Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen."
11116,11117,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,3.2.120,GLOUCESTER,[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done
11117,11118,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,3.2.121,GLOUCESTER,his shrift.
11118,11119,Henry VI Part 3,69.0,3.2.122,CLARENCE,"[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,"
11119,11120,Henry VI Part 3,69.0,3.2.123,CLARENCE,'twas for shift.
11120,11121,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,3.2.124,KING EDWARD IV,"Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had."
11121,11122,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.2.125,GLOUCESTER,"The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad."
11122,11123,Henry VI Part 3,72.0,3.2.126,KING EDWARD IV,You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
11123,11124,Henry VI Part 3,73.0,3.2.127,CLARENCE,"To whom, my lord?"
11124,11125,Henry VI Part 3,74.0,3.2.128,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, Clarence, to myself."
11125,11126,Henry VI Part 3,75.0,3.2.129,GLOUCESTER,That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
11126,11127,Henry VI Part 3,76.0,3.2.130,CLARENCE,That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
11127,11128,Henry VI Part 3,77.0,3.2.131,GLOUCESTER,By so much is the wonder in extremes.
11128,11129,Henry VI Part 3,78.0,3.2.132,KING EDWARD IV,"Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both"
11129,11130,Henry VI Part 3,78.0,3.2.133,KING EDWARD IV,Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
11130,11131,Henry VI Part 3,78.0,,KING EDWARD IV,Enter a Nobleman
11131,11132,Henry VI Part 3,79.0,3.2.134,Nobleman,"My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,"
11132,11133,Henry VI Part 3,79.0,3.2.135,Nobleman,And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
11133,11134,Henry VI Part 3,80.0,3.2.136,KING EDWARD IV,See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
11134,11135,Henry VI Part 3,80.0,3.2.137,KING EDWARD IV,"And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,"
11135,11136,Henry VI Part 3,80.0,3.2.138,KING EDWARD IV,To question of his apprehension.
11136,11137,Henry VI Part 3,80.0,3.2.139,KING EDWARD IV,"Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably."
11137,11138,Henry VI Part 3,80.0,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
11138,11139,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.140,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, Edward will use women honourably."
11139,11140,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.141,GLOUCESTER,"Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,"
11140,11141,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.142,GLOUCESTER,"That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,"
11141,11142,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.143,GLOUCESTER,To cross me from the golden time I look for!
11142,11143,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.144,GLOUCESTER,"And yet, between my soul's desire and me--"
11143,11144,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.145,GLOUCESTER,The lustful Edward's title buried--
11144,11145,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.146,GLOUCESTER,"Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,"
11145,11146,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.147,GLOUCESTER,"And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,"
11146,11147,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.148,GLOUCESTER,"To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:"
11147,11148,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.149,GLOUCESTER,A cold premeditation for my purpose!
11148,11149,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.150,GLOUCESTER,"Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty,"
11149,11150,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.151,GLOUCESTER,"Like one that stands upon a promontory,"
11150,11151,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.152,GLOUCESTER,"And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,"
11151,11152,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.153,GLOUCESTER,"Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,"
11152,11153,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.154,GLOUCESTER,"And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,"
11153,11154,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.155,GLOUCESTER,"Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:"
11154,11155,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.156,GLOUCESTER,"So do I wish the crown, being so far off,"
11155,11156,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.157,GLOUCESTER,"And so I chide the means that keeps me from it,"
11156,11157,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.158,GLOUCESTER,"And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,"
11157,11158,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.159,GLOUCESTER,Flattering me with impossibilities.
11158,11159,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.160,GLOUCESTER,"My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,"
11159,11160,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.161,GLOUCESTER,Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
11160,11161,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.162,GLOUCESTER,"Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard,"
11161,11162,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.163,GLOUCESTER,What other pleasure can the world afford?
11162,11163,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.164,GLOUCESTER,"I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,"
11163,11164,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.165,GLOUCESTER,"And deck my body in gay ornaments,"
11164,11165,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.166,GLOUCESTER,And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
11165,11166,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.167,GLOUCESTER,O miserable thought! and more unlikely
11166,11167,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.168,GLOUCESTER,Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
11167,11168,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.169,GLOUCESTER,"Why, love forswore me in my  mother's womb:"
11168,11169,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.170,GLOUCESTER,"And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,"
11169,11170,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.171,GLOUCESTER,"She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,"
11170,11171,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.172,GLOUCESTER,"To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub,"
11171,11172,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.173,GLOUCESTER,"To make an envious mountain on my back,"
11172,11173,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.174,GLOUCESTER,"Where sits deformity to mock my body,"
11173,11174,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.175,GLOUCESTER,"To shape my legs of an unequal size,"
11174,11175,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.176,GLOUCESTER,"To disproportion me in every part,"
11175,11176,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.177,GLOUCESTER,"Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp"
11176,11177,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.178,GLOUCESTER,That carries no impression like the dam.
11177,11178,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.179,GLOUCESTER,And am I then a man to be beloved?
11178,11179,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.180,GLOUCESTER,"O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!"
11179,11180,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.181,GLOUCESTER,"Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,"
11180,11181,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.182,GLOUCESTER,"But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such"
11181,11182,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.183,GLOUCESTER,"As are of better person than myself,"
11182,11183,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.184,GLOUCESTER,"I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,"
11183,11184,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.185,GLOUCESTER,"And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,"
11184,11185,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.186,GLOUCESTER,Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
11185,11186,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.187,GLOUCESTER,Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
11186,11187,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.188,GLOUCESTER,"And yet I know not how to get the crown,"
11187,11188,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.189,GLOUCESTER,For many lives stand between me and home:
11188,11189,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.190,GLOUCESTER,"And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,"
11189,11190,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.191,GLOUCESTER,"That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,"
11190,11191,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.192,GLOUCESTER,"Seeking a way and straying from the way,"
11191,11192,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.193,GLOUCESTER,"Not knowing how to find the open air,"
11192,11193,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.194,GLOUCESTER,"But toiling desperately to find it out,--"
11193,11194,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.195,GLOUCESTER,Torment myself to catch the English crown:
11194,11195,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.196,GLOUCESTER,"And from that torment I will free myself,"
11195,11196,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.197,GLOUCESTER,Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
11196,11197,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.198,GLOUCESTER,"Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,"
11197,11198,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.199,GLOUCESTER,"And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,"
11198,11199,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.200,GLOUCESTER,"And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,"
11199,11200,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.201,GLOUCESTER,And frame my face to all occasions.
11200,11201,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.202,GLOUCESTER,"I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,"
11201,11202,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.203,GLOUCESTER,"I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk,"
11202,11203,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.204,GLOUCESTER,"I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,"
11203,11204,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.205,GLOUCESTER,"Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,"
11204,11205,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.206,GLOUCESTER,"And, like a Sinon, take another Troy."
11205,11206,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.207,GLOUCESTER,"I can add colours to the chameleon,"
11206,11207,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.208,GLOUCESTER,"Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,"
11207,11208,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.209,GLOUCESTER,And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
11208,11209,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.210,GLOUCESTER,"Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?"
11209,11210,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,3.2.211,GLOUCESTER,"Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down."
11210,11211,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit
11211,11212,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.
11212,11213,Henry VI Part 3,81.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,  his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN  MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again"
11213,11214,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.3.1,KING LEWIS XI,"Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,"
11214,11215,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.3.2,KING LEWIS XI,Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
11215,11216,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,3.3.3,KING LEWIS XI,"And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit."
11216,11217,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.4,QUEEN MARGARET,"No, mighty King of France: now Margaret"
11217,11218,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.5,QUEEN MARGARET,Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
11218,11219,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.6,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where kings command. I was, I must confess,"
11219,11220,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.7,QUEEN MARGARET,Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
11220,11221,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.8,QUEEN MARGARET,"But now mischance hath trod my title down,"
11221,11222,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.9,QUEEN MARGARET,"And with dishonour laid me on the ground,"
11222,11223,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.10,QUEEN MARGARET,"Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,"
11223,11224,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,3.3.11,QUEEN MARGARET,And to my humble seat conform myself.
11224,11225,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,3.3.12,KING LEWIS XI,"Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?"
11225,11226,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,3.3.13,QUEEN MARGARET,From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
11226,11227,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,3.3.14,QUEEN MARGARET,"And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares."
11227,11228,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.3.15,KING LEWIS XI,"Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,"
11228,11229,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.3.16,KING LEWIS XI,And sit thee by our side:
11229,11230,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,,KING LEWIS XI,Seats her by him
11230,11231,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.3.17,KING LEWIS XI,Yield not thy neck
11231,11232,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.3.18,KING LEWIS XI,"To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind"
11232,11233,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.3.19,KING LEWIS XI,Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
11233,11234,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.3.20,KING LEWIS XI,"Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief,"
11234,11235,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,3.3.21,KING LEWIS XI,"It shall be eased, if France can yield relief."
11235,11236,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.22,QUEEN MARGARET,Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
11236,11237,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.23,QUEEN MARGARET,And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
11237,11238,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.24,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,"
11238,11239,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.25,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry, sole possessor of my love,"
11239,11240,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.26,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is of a king become a banish'd man,"
11240,11241,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.27,QUEEN MARGARET,"And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn,"
11241,11242,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.28,QUEEN MARGARET,While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
11242,11243,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.29,QUEEN MARGARET,Usurps the regal title and the seat
11243,11244,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.30,QUEEN MARGARET,Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
11244,11245,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.31,QUEEN MARGARET,"This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,"
11245,11246,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.32,QUEEN MARGARET,"With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,"
11246,11247,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.33,QUEEN MARGARET,"Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid,"
11247,11248,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.34,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:"
11248,11249,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.35,QUEEN MARGARET,"Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help,"
11249,11250,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.36,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our people and our peers are both misled,"
11250,11251,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.37,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,"
11251,11252,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,3.3.38,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight."
11252,11253,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,3.3.39,KING LEWIS XI,"Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,"
11253,11254,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,3.3.40,KING LEWIS XI,While we bethink a means to break it off.
11254,11255,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,3.3.41,QUEEN MARGARET,"The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe."
11255,11256,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,3.3.42,KING LEWIS XI,"The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee."
11256,11257,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.3.43,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow."
11257,11258,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,3.3.44,QUEEN MARGARET,And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
11258,11259,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Enter WARWICK
11259,11260,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,3.3.45,KING LEWIS XI,What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
11260,11261,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,3.3.46,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend."
11261,11262,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,3.3.47,KING LEWIS XI,"Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?"
11262,11263,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,,KING LEWIS XI,He descends. She ariseth
11263,11264,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,3.3.48,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,"
11264,11265,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,3.3.49,QUEEN MARGARET,For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
11265,11266,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.50,WARWICK,"From worthy Edward, King of Albion,"
11266,11267,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.51,WARWICK,"My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,"
11267,11268,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.52,WARWICK,"I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,"
11268,11269,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.53,WARWICK,"First, to do greetings to thy royal person,"
11269,11270,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.54,WARWICK,"And then to crave a league of amity,"
11270,11271,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.55,WARWICK,"And lastly, to confirm that amity"
11271,11272,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.56,WARWICK,"With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant"
11272,11273,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.57,WARWICK,"That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,"
11273,11274,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,3.3.58,WARWICK,To England's king in lawful marriage.
11274,11275,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,3.3.59,QUEEN MARGARET,"[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done."
11275,11276,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.3.60,WARWICK,"[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,"
11276,11277,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.3.61,WARWICK,"I am commanded, with your leave and favour,"
11277,11278,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.3.62,WARWICK,"Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue"
11278,11279,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.3.63,WARWICK,"To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart,"
11279,11280,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.3.64,WARWICK,"Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,"
11280,11281,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,3.3.65,WARWICK,Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
11281,11282,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.66,QUEEN MARGARET,"King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,"
11282,11283,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.67,QUEEN MARGARET,Before you answer Warwick. His demand
11283,11284,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.68,QUEEN MARGARET,"Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,"
11284,11285,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.69,QUEEN MARGARET,"But from deceit bred by necessity,"
11285,11286,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.70,QUEEN MARGARET,"For how can tyrants safely govern home,"
11286,11287,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.71,QUEEN MARGARET,Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
11287,11288,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.72,QUEEN MARGARET,"To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,"
11288,11289,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.73,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,"
11289,11290,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son."
11290,11291,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage"
11291,11292,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour,"
11292,11293,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,"
11293,11294,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,3.3.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs."
11294,11295,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,3.3.79,WARWICK,Injurious Margaret!
11295,11296,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,3.3.80,PRINCE EDWARD,And why not queen?
11296,11297,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,3.3.81,WARWICK,"Because thy father Henry did usurp,"
11297,11298,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,3.3.82,WARWICK,And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
11298,11299,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.3.83,OXFORD,"Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,"
11299,11300,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.3.84,OXFORD,"Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain,"
11300,11301,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.3.85,OXFORD,"And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,"
11301,11302,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.3.86,OXFORD,"Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest,"
11302,11303,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.3.87,OXFORD,"And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,"
11303,11304,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.3.88,OXFORD,Who by his prowess conquered all France:
11304,11305,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,3.3.89,OXFORD,From these our Henry lineally descends.
11305,11306,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.3.90,WARWICK,"Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,"
11306,11307,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.3.91,WARWICK,You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
11307,11308,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.3.92,WARWICK,All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
11308,11309,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.3.93,WARWICK,Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
11309,11310,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.3.94,WARWICK,"But for the rest, you tell a pedigree"
11310,11311,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.3.95,WARWICK,"Of threescore and two years, a silly time"
11311,11312,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,3.3.96,WARWICK,To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
11312,11313,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.3.97,OXFORD,"Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,"
11313,11314,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.3.98,OXFORD,"Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,"
11314,11315,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,3.3.99,OXFORD,And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
11315,11316,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,3.3.100,WARWICK,"Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,"
11316,11317,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,3.3.101,WARWICK,Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
11317,11318,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,3.3.102,WARWICK,"For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king."
11318,11319,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.3.103,OXFORD,Call him my king by whose injurious doom
11319,11320,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.3.104,OXFORD,"My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,"
11320,11321,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.3.105,OXFORD,"Was done to death? and more than so, my father,"
11321,11322,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.3.106,OXFORD,"Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,"
11322,11323,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.3.107,OXFORD,When nature brought him to the door of death?
11323,11324,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.3.108,OXFORD,"No, Warwick, no, while life upholds this arm,"
11324,11325,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,3.3.109,OXFORD,This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
11325,11326,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,3.3.110,WARWICK,And I the house of York.
11326,11327,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,3.3.111,KING LEWIS XI,"Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,"
11327,11328,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,3.3.112,KING LEWIS XI,"Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,"
11328,11329,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,3.3.113,KING LEWIS XI,While I use further conference with Warwick.
11329,11330,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,,KING LEWIS XI,They stand aloof
11330,11331,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,3.3.114,QUEEN MARGARET,Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
11331,11332,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,3.3.115,KING LEWIS XI,"Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,"
11332,11333,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,3.3.116,KING LEWIS XI,Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
11333,11334,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,3.3.117,KING LEWIS XI,To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
11334,11335,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,3.3.118,WARWICK,Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
11335,11336,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,3.3.119,KING LEWIS XI,But is he gracious in the people's eye?
11336,11337,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,3.3.120,WARWICK,The more that Henry was unfortunate.
11337,11338,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,3.3.121,KING LEWIS XI,"Then further, all dissembling set aside,"
11338,11339,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,3.3.122,KING LEWIS XI,Tell me for truth the measure of his love
11339,11340,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,3.3.123,KING LEWIS XI,Unto our sister Bona.
11340,11341,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.124,WARWICK,Such it seems
11341,11342,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.125,WARWICK,As may beseem a monarch like himself.
11342,11343,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.126,WARWICK,Myself have often heard him say and swear
11343,11344,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.127,WARWICK,"That this his love was an eternal plant,"
11344,11345,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.128,WARWICK,"Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,"
11345,11346,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.129,WARWICK,"The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,"
11346,11347,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.130,WARWICK,"Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,"
11347,11348,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,3.3.131,WARWICK,Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
11348,11349,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,3.3.132,KING LEWIS XI,"Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve."
11349,11350,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,3.3.133,BONA,"Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:"
11350,11351,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,,BONA,To WARWICK
11351,11352,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,3.3.134,BONA,"Yet I confess that often ere this day,"
11352,11353,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,3.3.135,BONA,"When I have heard your king's desert recounted,"
11353,11354,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,3.3.136,BONA,Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
11354,11355,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,3.3.137,KING LEWIS XI,"Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's,"
11355,11356,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,3.3.138,KING LEWIS XI,And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
11356,11357,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,3.3.139,KING LEWIS XI,"Touching the jointure that your king must make,"
11357,11358,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,3.3.140,KING LEWIS XI,Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
11358,11359,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,3.3.141,KING LEWIS XI,"Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness"
11359,11360,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,3.3.142,KING LEWIS XI,That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
11360,11361,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,3.3.143,PRINCE EDWARD,"To Edward, but not to the English king."
11361,11362,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,3.3.144,QUEEN MARGARET,Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
11362,11363,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,3.3.145,QUEEN MARGARET,By this alliance to make void my suit:
11363,11364,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,3.3.146,QUEEN MARGARET,Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
11364,11365,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.3.147,KING LEWIS XI,And still is friend to him and Margaret:
11365,11366,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.3.148,KING LEWIS XI,"But if your title to the crown be weak,"
11366,11367,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.3.149,KING LEWIS XI,"As may appear by Edward's good success,"
11367,11368,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.3.150,KING LEWIS XI,Then 'tis but reason that I be released
11368,11369,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.3.151,KING LEWIS XI,From giving aid which late I promised.
11369,11370,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.3.152,KING LEWIS XI,Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
11370,11371,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,3.3.153,KING LEWIS XI,That your estate requires and mine can yield.
11371,11372,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,3.3.154,WARWICK,"Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,"
11372,11373,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,3.3.155,WARWICK,"Where having nothing, nothing can he lose."
11373,11374,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,3.3.156,WARWICK,"And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,"
11374,11375,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,3.3.157,WARWICK,"You have a father able to maintain you,"
11375,11376,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,3.3.158,WARWICK,And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
11376,11377,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,3.3.159,QUEEN MARGARET,"Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,"
11377,11378,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,3.3.160,QUEEN MARGARET,Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
11378,11379,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,3.3.161,QUEEN MARGARET,"I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,"
11379,11380,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,3.3.162,QUEEN MARGARET,"Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold"
11380,11381,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,3.3.163,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love,"
11381,11382,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,3.3.164,QUEEN MARGARET,For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
11382,11383,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Post blows a horn within
11383,11384,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,3.3.165,KING LEWIS XI,"Warwick, this is some post to us or thee."
11384,11385,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,,KING LEWIS XI,Enter a Post
11385,11386,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,3.3.166,Post,"[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,"
11386,11387,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,3.3.167,Post,"Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:"
11387,11388,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,,Post,To KING LEWIS XI
11388,11389,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,3.3.168,Post,These from our king unto your majesty:
11389,11390,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,,Post,To QUEEN MARGARET
11390,11391,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,3.3.169,Post,"And, madam, these for you, from whom I know not."
11391,11392,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,,Post,They all read their letters
11392,11393,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,3.3.170,OXFORD,I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
11393,11394,Henry VI Part 3,46.0,3.3.171,OXFORD,"Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his."
11394,11395,Henry VI Part 3,47.0,3.3.172,PRINCE EDWARD,"Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:"
11395,11396,Henry VI Part 3,47.0,3.3.173,PRINCE EDWARD,I hope all's for the best.
11396,11397,Henry VI Part 3,48.0,3.3.174,KING LEWIS XI,"Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?"
11397,11398,Henry VI Part 3,49.0,3.3.175,QUEEN MARGARET,"Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys."
11398,11399,Henry VI Part 3,50.0,3.3.176,WARWICK,"Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent."
11399,11400,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,3.3.177,KING LEWIS XI,What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
11400,11401,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,3.3.178,KING LEWIS XI,"And now, to soothe your forgery and his,"
11401,11402,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,3.3.179,KING LEWIS XI,Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
11402,11403,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,3.3.180,KING LEWIS XI,Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
11403,11404,Henry VI Part 3,51.0,3.3.181,KING LEWIS XI,Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
11404,11405,Henry VI Part 3,52.0,3.3.182,QUEEN MARGARET,I told your majesty as much before:
11405,11406,Henry VI Part 3,52.0,3.3.183,QUEEN MARGARET,This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
11406,11407,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.184,WARWICK,"King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,"
11407,11408,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.185,WARWICK,"And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,"
11408,11409,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.186,WARWICK,"That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,"
11409,11410,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.187,WARWICK,"No more my king, for he dishonours me,"
11410,11411,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.188,WARWICK,"But most himself, if he could see his shame."
11411,11412,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.189,WARWICK,Did I forget that by the house of York
11412,11413,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.190,WARWICK,My father came untimely to his death?
11413,11414,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.191,WARWICK,Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
11414,11415,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.192,WARWICK,Did I impale him with the regal crown?
11415,11416,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.193,WARWICK,Did I put Henry from his native right?
11416,11417,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.194,WARWICK,And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
11417,11418,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.195,WARWICK,Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
11418,11419,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.196,WARWICK,"And to repair my honour lost for him,"
11419,11420,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.197,WARWICK,I here renounce him and return to Henry.
11420,11421,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.198,WARWICK,"My noble queen, let former grudges pass,"
11421,11422,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.199,WARWICK,And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
11422,11423,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.200,WARWICK,"I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,"
11423,11424,Henry VI Part 3,53.0,3.3.201,WARWICK,And replant Henry in his former state.
11424,11425,Henry VI Part 3,54.0,3.3.202,QUEEN MARGARET,"Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love,"
11425,11426,Henry VI Part 3,54.0,3.3.203,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I forgive and quite forget old faults,"
11426,11427,Henry VI Part 3,54.0,3.3.204,QUEEN MARGARET,And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
11427,11428,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.205,WARWICK,"So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,"
11428,11429,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.206,WARWICK,"That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us"
11429,11430,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.207,WARWICK,"With some few bands of chosen soldiers,"
11430,11431,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.208,WARWICK,I'll undertake to land them on our coast
11431,11432,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.209,WARWICK,And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
11432,11433,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.210,WARWICK,'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
11433,11434,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.211,WARWICK,"And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,"
11434,11435,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.212,WARWICK,"He's very likely now to fall from him,"
11435,11436,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.213,WARWICK,"For matching more for wanton lust than honour,"
11436,11437,Henry VI Part 3,55.0,3.3.214,WARWICK,Or than for strength and safety of our country.
11437,11438,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,3.3.215,BONA,"Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged"
11438,11439,Henry VI Part 3,56.0,3.3.216,BONA,But by thy help to this distressed queen?
11439,11440,Henry VI Part 3,57.0,3.3.217,QUEEN MARGARET,"Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,"
11440,11441,Henry VI Part 3,57.0,3.3.218,QUEEN MARGARET,Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
11441,11442,Henry VI Part 3,58.0,3.3.219,BONA,My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
11442,11443,Henry VI Part 3,59.0,3.3.220,WARWICK,"And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours."
11443,11444,Henry VI Part 3,60.0,3.3.221,KING LEWIS XI,"And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's."
11444,11445,Henry VI Part 3,60.0,3.3.222,KING LEWIS XI,Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
11445,11446,Henry VI Part 3,60.0,3.3.223,KING LEWIS XI,You shall have aid.
11446,11447,Henry VI Part 3,61.0,3.3.224,QUEEN MARGARET,Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
11447,11448,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.3.225,KING LEWIS XI,"Then, England's messenger, return in post,"
11448,11449,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.3.226,KING LEWIS XI,"And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,"
11449,11450,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.3.227,KING LEWIS XI,That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
11450,11451,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.3.228,KING LEWIS XI,To revel it with him and his new bride:
11451,11452,Henry VI Part 3,62.0,3.3.229,KING LEWIS XI,"Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal."
11452,11453,Henry VI Part 3,63.0,3.3.230,BONA,"Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"
11453,11454,Henry VI Part 3,63.0,3.3.231,BONA,I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
11454,11455,Henry VI Part 3,64.0,3.3.232,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,"
11455,11456,Henry VI Part 3,64.0,3.3.233,QUEEN MARGARET,And I am ready to put armour on.
11456,11457,Henry VI Part 3,65.0,3.3.234,WARWICK,"Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,"
11457,11458,Henry VI Part 3,65.0,3.3.235,WARWICK,And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
11458,11459,Henry VI Part 3,65.0,3.3.236,WARWICK,There's thy reward: be gone.
11459,11460,Henry VI Part 3,65.0,,WARWICK,Exit Post
11460,11461,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.3.237,KING LEWIS XI,"But, Warwick,"
11461,11462,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.3.238,KING LEWIS XI,"Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,"
11462,11463,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.3.239,KING LEWIS XI,"Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle,"
11463,11464,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.3.240,KING LEWIS XI,"And, as occasion serves, this noble queen"
11464,11465,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.3.241,KING LEWIS XI,And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
11465,11466,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.3.242,KING LEWIS XI,"Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,"
11466,11467,Henry VI Part 3,66.0,3.3.243,KING LEWIS XI,What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
11467,11468,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.3.244,WARWICK,"This shall assure my constant loyalty,"
11468,11469,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.3.245,WARWICK,"That if our queen and this young prince agree,"
11469,11470,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.3.246,WARWICK,I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
11470,11471,Henry VI Part 3,67.0,3.3.247,WARWICK,To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
11471,11472,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,3.3.248,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion."
11472,11473,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,3.3.249,QUEEN MARGARET,"Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,"
11473,11474,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,3.3.250,QUEEN MARGARET,"Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,"
11474,11475,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,3.3.251,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,"
11475,11476,Henry VI Part 3,68.0,3.3.252,QUEEN MARGARET,That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
11476,11477,Henry VI Part 3,69.0,3.3.253,PRINCE EDWARD,"Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,"
11477,11478,Henry VI Part 3,69.0,3.3.254,PRINCE EDWARD,"And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand."
11478,11479,Henry VI Part 3,69.0,,PRINCE EDWARD,He gives his hand to WARWICK
11479,11480,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,3.3.255,KING LEWIS XI,"Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,"
11480,11481,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,3.3.256,KING LEWIS XI,"And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,"
11481,11482,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,3.3.257,KING LEWIS XI,Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
11482,11483,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,3.3.258,KING LEWIS XI,"I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,"
11483,11484,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,3.3.259,KING LEWIS XI,For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
11484,11485,Henry VI Part 3,70.0,,KING LEWIS XI,Exeunt all but WARWICK
11485,11486,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.260,WARWICK,"I came from Edward as ambassador,"
11486,11487,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.261,WARWICK,But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
11487,11488,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.262,WARWICK,"Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,"
11488,11489,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.263,WARWICK,But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
11489,11490,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.264,WARWICK,Had he none else to make a stale but me?
11490,11491,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.265,WARWICK,Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
11491,11492,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.266,WARWICK,"I was the chief that raised him to the crown,"
11492,11493,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.267,WARWICK,And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
11493,11494,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.268,WARWICK,"Not that I pity Henry's misery,"
11494,11495,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,3.3.269,WARWICK,But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
11495,11496,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,,WARWICK,Exit
11496,11497,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,,WARWICK,ACT IV
11497,11498,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,,WARWICK,SCENE I. London. The palace.
11498,11499,Henry VI Part 3,71.0,,WARWICK,"Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE"
11499,11500,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.1.1,GLOUCESTER,"Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you"
11500,11501,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.1.2,GLOUCESTER,Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
11501,11502,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.1.3,GLOUCESTER,Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
11502,11503,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.1.4,CLARENCE,"Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France,"
11503,11504,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.1.5,CLARENCE,How could he stay till Warwick made return?
11504,11505,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.1.6,SOMERSET,"My lords, forbear this talk, here comes the king."
11505,11506,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.1.7,GLOUCESTER,And his well-chosen bride.
11506,11507,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.1.8,CLARENCE,I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
11507,11508,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.1.8,CLARENCE,"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended, QUEEN ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others"
11508,11509,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.1.9,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,"
11509,11510,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.1.10,KING EDWARD IV,"That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?"
11510,11511,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.1.11,CLARENCE,"As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,"
11511,11512,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.1.12,CLARENCE,Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
11512,11513,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.1.13,CLARENCE,That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
11513,11514,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.1.14,KING EDWARD IV,"Suppose they take offence without a cause,"
11514,11515,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.1.15,KING EDWARD IV,"They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,"
11515,11516,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.1.16,KING EDWARD IV,"Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will."
11516,11517,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.1.17,GLOUCESTER,"And shall have your will, because our king:"
11517,11518,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.1.18,GLOUCESTER,Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
11518,11519,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.1.19,KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?"
11519,11520,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.1.20,GLOUCESTER,Not I:
11520,11521,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.1.21,GLOUCESTER,"No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd"
11521,11522,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.1.22,GLOUCESTER,"Whom God hath join'd together, ay, and 'twere pity"
11522,11523,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.1.23,GLOUCESTER,To sunder them that yoke so well together.
11523,11524,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.1.24,KING EDWARD IV,"Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,"
11524,11525,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.1.25,KING EDWARD IV,Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
11525,11526,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.1.26,KING EDWARD IV,Should not become my wife and England's queen.
11526,11527,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.1.27,KING EDWARD IV,"And you too, Somerset and Montague,"
11527,11528,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.1.28,KING EDWARD IV,Speak freely what you think.
11528,11529,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.1.29,CLARENCE,Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
11529,11530,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.1.30,CLARENCE,"Becomes your enemy, for mocking him"
11530,11531,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.1.31,CLARENCE,About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
11531,11532,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,"
11532,11533,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.1.33,GLOUCESTER,Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
11533,11534,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,4.1.34,KING EDWARD IV,What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
11534,11535,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,4.1.35,KING EDWARD IV,By such invention as I can devise?
11535,11536,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.1.36,MONTAGUE,"Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance"
11536,11537,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.1.37,MONTAGUE,Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
11537,11538,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.1.38,MONTAGUE,'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
11538,11539,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.1.39,HASTINGS,"Why, knows not Montague that of itself"
11539,11540,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.1.40,HASTINGS,"England is safe, if true within itself?"
11540,11541,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.1.41,MONTAGUE,But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
11541,11542,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.1.42,HASTINGS,'Tis better using France than trusting France:
11542,11543,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.1.43,HASTINGS,Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
11543,11544,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.1.44,HASTINGS,"Which He hath given for fence impregnable,"
11544,11545,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.1.45,HASTINGS,"And with their helps only defend ourselves,"
11545,11546,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.1.46,HASTINGS,In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
11546,11547,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.1.47,CLARENCE,For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
11547,11548,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.1.48,CLARENCE,To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
11548,11549,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.1.49,KING EDWARD IV,"Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant,"
11549,11550,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.1.50,KING EDWARD IV,And for this once my will shall stand for law.
11550,11551,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.1.51,GLOUCESTER,"And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,"
11551,11552,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.1.52,GLOUCESTER,To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
11552,11553,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.1.53,GLOUCESTER,"Unto the brother of your loving bride,"
11553,11554,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.1.54,GLOUCESTER,She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
11554,11555,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.1.55,GLOUCESTER,But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
11555,11556,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.1.56,CLARENCE,Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
11556,11557,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.1.57,CLARENCE,"Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,"
11557,11558,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.1.58,CLARENCE,And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
11558,11559,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,4.1.59,KING EDWARD IV,"Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife"
11559,11560,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,4.1.60,KING EDWARD IV,That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
11560,11561,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.1.61,CLARENCE,"In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,"
11561,11562,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.1.62,CLARENCE,"Which being shallow, you give me leave"
11562,11563,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.1.63,CLARENCE,"To play the broker in mine own behalf,"
11563,11564,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.1.64,CLARENCE,And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
11564,11565,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,4.1.65,KING EDWARD IV,"Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,"
11565,11566,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,4.1.66,KING EDWARD IV,And not be tied unto his brother's will.
11566,11567,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.67,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My lords, before it pleased his majesty"
11567,11568,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.68,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To raise my state to title of a queen,"
11568,11569,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.69,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Do me but right, and you must all confess"
11569,11570,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.70,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I was not ignoble of descent,"
11570,11571,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.71,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
11571,11572,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.72,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But as this title honours me and mine,"
11572,11573,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.73,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,"
11573,11574,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.1.74,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.
11574,11575,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.75,KING EDWARD IV,"My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:"
11575,11576,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.76,KING EDWARD IV,"What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,"
11576,11577,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.77,KING EDWARD IV,"So long as Edward is thy constant friend,"
11577,11578,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.78,KING EDWARD IV,"And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?"
11578,11579,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.79,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,"
11579,11580,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.80,KING EDWARD IV,"Unless they seek for hatred at my hands,"
11580,11581,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.81,KING EDWARD IV,"Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,"
11581,11582,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.1.82,KING EDWARD IV,And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
11582,11583,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,4.1.83,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  I hear, yet say not much, but think the more."
11583,11584,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter a Post
11584,11585,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,4.1.84,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, messenger, what letters or what news"
11585,11586,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,4.1.85,KING EDWARD IV,From France?
11586,11587,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,4.1.86,Post,"My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,"
11587,11588,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,4.1.87,Post,"But such as I, without your special pardon,"
11588,11589,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,4.1.88,Post,Dare not relate.
11589,11590,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.1.89,KING EDWARD IV,"Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,"
11590,11591,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.1.90,KING EDWARD IV,Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
11591,11592,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.1.91,KING EDWARD IV,What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
11592,11593,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,4.1.92,Post,"At my depart, these were his very words:"
11593,11594,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,4.1.93,Post,"'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,"
11594,11595,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,4.1.94,Post,That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
11595,11596,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,4.1.95,Post,To revel it with him and his new bride.'
11596,11597,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,4.1.96,KING EDWARD IV,Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
11597,11598,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,4.1.97,KING EDWARD IV,But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
11598,11599,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,4.1.98,Post,"These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:"
11599,11600,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,4.1.99,Post,"'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,"
11600,11601,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,4.1.100,Post,I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'
11601,11602,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,4.1.101,KING EDWARD IV,"I blame not her, she could say little less,"
11602,11603,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,4.1.102,KING EDWARD IV,She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
11603,11604,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,4.1.103,KING EDWARD IV,For I have heard that she was there in place.
11604,11605,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,4.1.104,Post,"'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,"
11605,11606,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,4.1.105,Post,And I am ready to put armour on.'
11606,11607,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,4.1.106,KING EDWARD IV,Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
11607,11608,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,4.1.107,KING EDWARD IV,But what said Warwick to these injuries?
11608,11609,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,4.1.108,Post,"He, more incensed against your majesty"
11609,11610,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,4.1.109,Post,"Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:"

11613,11614,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,4.1.113,KING EDWARD IV,"Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:"
11614,11615,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,4.1.114,KING EDWARD IV,They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
11615,11616,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,4.1.115,KING EDWARD IV,"But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?"

11639,11640,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,4.1.137,KING EDWARD IV,Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
11640,11641,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,4.1.138,KING EDWARD IV,Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
11641,11642,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,4.1.139,KING EDWARD IV,"If it be so, then both depart to him,"
11642,11643,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,4.1.140,KING EDWARD IV,I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
11643,11644,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,4.1.141,KING EDWARD IV,"But if you mind to hold your true obedience,"
11644,11645,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,4.1.142,KING EDWARD IV,"Give me assurance with some friendly vow,"

11651,11652,Henry VI Part 3,49.0,4.1.149,KING EDWARD IV,"Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour,"
11652,11653,Henry VI Part 3,49.0,4.1.150,KING EDWARD IV,Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.

11658,11659,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,WARWICK,Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
11659,11660,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.2.3,WARWICK,But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
11660,11661,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.2.4,WARWICK,"Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?"
11661,11662,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.2.5,CLARENCE,"Fear not that, my lord."
11662,11663,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.6,WARWICK,"Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick,"
11663,11664,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.7,WARWICK,"And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice"
11664,11665,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.8,WARWICK,To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
11665,11666,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.9,WARWICK,"Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love,"

11667,11668,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.11,WARWICK,Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
11668,11669,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.12,WARWICK,"But welcome, sweet Clarence, my daughter shall be thine."
11669,11670,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.13,WARWICK,"And now what rests but, in night's coverture,"
11670,11671,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.14,WARWICK,"Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,"
11671,11672,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.15,WARWICK,"His soldiers lurking in the towns about,"
11672,11673,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.16,WARWICK,"And but attended by a simple guard,"
11673,11674,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.17,WARWICK,We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
11674,11675,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.18,WARWICK,Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
11675,11676,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.19,WARWICK,That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
11676,11677,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.20,WARWICK,"With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,"
11677,11678,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.21,WARWICK,"And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,"
11678,11679,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.22,WARWICK,"So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,"
11679,11680,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.23,WARWICK,At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
11680,11681,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.24,WARWICK,"And seize himself, I say not, slaughter him,"
11681,11682,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.25,WARWICK,For I intend but only to surprise him.
11682,11683,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.26,WARWICK,"You that will follow me to this attempt,"
11683,11684,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.27,WARWICK,Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
11684,11685,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.27,WARWICK,"They all cry, 'Henry!'"
11685,11686,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.2.28,WARWICK,"Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:"

11690,11691,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.3.1,First Watchman,"Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:"
11691,11692,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.3.2,First Watchman,The king by this is set him down to sleep.
11692,11693,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.3.3,Second Watchman,"What, will he not to bed?"
11693,11694,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.3.4,First Watchman,"Why, no, for he hath made a solemn vow"
11694,11695,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.3.5,First Watchman,Never to lie and take his natural rest
11695,11696,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.3.6,First Watchman,Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
11696,11697,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.3.7,Second Watchman,"To-morrow then belike shall be the day,"
11697,11698,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.3.8,Second Watchman,If Warwick be so near as men report.
11698,11699,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.3.9,Third Watchman,"But say, I pray, what nobleman is that"
11699,11700,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.3.10,Third Watchman,That with the king here resteth in his tent?
11700,11701,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.3.11,First Watchman,"'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend."
11701,11702,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.3.12,Third Watchman,"O, is it so? But why commands the king"
11702,11703,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.3.13,Third Watchman,"That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,"
11703,11704,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.3.14,Third Watchman,While he himself keeps in the cold field?
11704,11705,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.3.15,Second Watchman,"'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous."
11705,11706,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.3.16,Third Watchman,"Ay, but give me worship and quietness,"
11706,11707,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.3.17,Third Watchman,I like it better than a dangerous honour.
11707,11708,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.3.18,Third Watchman,"If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,"
11708,11709,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.3.19,Third Watchman,'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
11709,11710,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.3.20,First Watchman,Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
11710,11711,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.3.21,Second Watchman,"Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,"
11711,11712,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.3.22,Second Watchman,But to defend his person from night-foes?
11712,11713,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,,Second Watchman,"Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and French soldiers, silent all"
11713,11714,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.3.23,WARWICK,"This is his tent, and see where stand his guard."
11714,11715,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.3.24,WARWICK,"Courage, my masters! honour now or never!"
11715,11716,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.3.25,WARWICK,"But follow me, and Edward shall be ours."
11716,11717,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.3.26,First Watchman,Who goes there?
11717,11718,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.3.27,Second Watchman,"Stay, or thou diest!"
11718,11719,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.3.27,Second Watchman,"WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!'  and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm! arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them"
11719,11720,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,,Second Watchman,"The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and the rest, bringing KING  EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a chair. RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage"
11720,11721,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,4.3.28,SOMERSET,What are they that fly there?
11721,11722,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.3.29,WARWICK,"Richard and Hastings: let them go, here is The duke."
11722,11723,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.3.30,KING EDWARD IV,"The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,"
11723,11724,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.3.31,KING EDWARD IV,Thou call'dst me king.
11724,11725,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.32,WARWICK,"Ay, but the case is alter'd:"
11725,11726,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.33,WARWICK,"When you disgraced me in my embassade,"
11726,11727,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.34,WARWICK,"Then I degraded you from being king,"
11727,11728,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.35,WARWICK,And come now to create you Duke of York.
11728,11729,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.36,WARWICK,"Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,"
11729,11730,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.37,WARWICK,"That know not how to use ambassadors,"
11730,11731,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.38,WARWICK,"Nor how to be contented with one wife,"
11731,11732,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.39,WARWICK,"Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,"
11732,11733,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.40,WARWICK,"Nor how to study for the people's welfare,"
11733,11734,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.3.41,WARWICK,Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
11734,11735,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.3.42,KING EDWARD IV,"Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?"
11735,11736,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.3.43,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down."
11736,11737,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.3.44,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,"
11737,11738,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.3.45,KING EDWARD IV,"Of thee thyself and all thy complices,"
11738,11739,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.3.46,KING EDWARD IV,Edward will always bear himself as king:
11739,11740,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.3.47,KING EDWARD IV,"Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,"
11740,11741,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.3.48,KING EDWARD IV,My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
11741,11742,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.49,WARWICK,"Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:"
11742,11743,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,,WARWICK,Takes off his crown
11743,11744,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.50,WARWICK,"But Henry now shall wear the English crown,"
11744,11745,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.51,WARWICK,"And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow."
11745,11746,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.52,WARWICK,"My Lord of Somerset, at my request,"
11746,11747,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.53,WARWICK,See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
11747,11748,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.54,WARWICK,"Unto my brother, Archbishop of York."
11748,11749,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.55,WARWICK,"When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,"

11750,11751,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.57,WARWICK,Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
11751,11752,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.3.58,WARWICK,"Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York."
11752,11753,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,,WARWICK,They lead him out forcibly
11753,11754,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.3.59,KING EDWARD IV,"What fates impose, that men must needs abide,"
11754,11755,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.3.60,KING EDWARD IV,It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
11755,11756,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,,KING EDWARD IV,"Exit, guarded"
11756,11757,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.3.61,OXFORD,"What now remains, my lords, for us to do"
11757,11758,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.3.62,OXFORD,But march to London with our soldiers?
11758,11759,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.3.63,WARWICK,"Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do,"
11759,11760,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.3.64,WARWICK,To free King Henry from imprisonment
11760,11761,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.3.65,WARWICK,And see him seated in the regal throne.

11764,11765,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.4.1,RIVERS,"Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?"
11765,11766,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.4.2,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn"
11766,11767,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.4.3,QUEEN ELIZABETH,What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
11767,11768,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.4.4,RIVERS,What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
11768,11769,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.4.5,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No, but the loss of his own royal person."
11769,11770,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.4.6,RIVERS,Then is my sovereign slain?
11770,11771,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.4.7,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,"
11771,11772,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.4.8,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
11772,11773,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.4.9,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
11773,11774,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.4.10,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And, as I further have to understand,"
11774,11775,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.4.11,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Is new committed to the Bishop of York,"
11775,11776,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.4.12,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.

11778,11779,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.4.15,RIVERS,"Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day."
11779,11780,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.4.16,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
11780,11781,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.4.17,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And I the rather wean me from despair
11781,11782,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.4.18,QUEEN ELIZABETH,For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
11782,11783,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.4.19,QUEEN ELIZABETH,This is it that makes me bridle passion
11783,11784,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.4.20,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross,"
11784,11785,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.4.21,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear"

11787,11788,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.4.24,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown."

11791,11792,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.28,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Guess thou the rest, King Edward's friends must down,"
11792,11793,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.29,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--"
11793,11794,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.30,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--"
11794,11795,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.31,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,"
11795,11796,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.32,QUEEN ELIZABETH,To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
11796,11797,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.33,QUEEN ELIZABETH,There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
11797,11798,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.34,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:"
11798,11799,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.4.35,QUEEN ELIZABETH,If Warwick take us we are sure to die.

11805,11806,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.4,GLOUCESTER,"Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,"
11806,11807,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.5,GLOUCESTER,"Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands"
11807,11808,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.6,GLOUCESTER,"He hath good usage and great liberty,"
11808,11809,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.7,GLOUCESTER,"And, often but attended with weak guard,"
11809,11810,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.8,GLOUCESTER,Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
11810,11811,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.9,GLOUCESTER,I have advertised him by secret means
11811,11812,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.10,GLOUCESTER,That if about this hour he make his way
11812,11813,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.5.11,GLOUCESTER,"Under the colour of his usual game,"

11817,11818,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.5.15,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand."
11818,11819,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.5.16,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"
11819,11820,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.5.17,KING EDWARD IV,"Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?"
11820,11821,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.5.18,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, the time and case requireth haste:"
11821,11822,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.5.19,GLOUCESTER,Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
11822,11823,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.5.20,KING EDWARD IV,But whither shall we then?
11823,11824,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.5.21,HASTINGS,"To Lynn, my lord,"
11824,11825,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.5.22,HASTINGS,And ship from thence to Flanders.
11825,11826,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.5.23,GLOUCESTER,"Well guess'd, believe me, for that was my meaning."
11826,11827,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.5.24,KING EDWARD IV,"Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness."
11827,11828,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.5.25,GLOUCESTER,But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
11828,11829,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.5.26,KING EDWARD IV,"Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?"
11829,11830,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.5.27,Huntsman,Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
11830,11831,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.5.28,GLOUCESTER,"Come then, away, let's ha' no more ado."
11831,11832,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.5.29,KING EDWARD IV,"Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown,"
11832,11833,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.5.30,KING EDWARD IV,And pray that I may repossess the crown.

11836,11837,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.6.1,KING HENRY VI,"Master lieutenant, now that God and friends"
11837,11838,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.6.2,KING HENRY VI,"Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,"
11838,11839,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.6.3,KING HENRY VI,"And turn'd my captive state to liberty,"
11839,11840,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.6.4,KING HENRY VI,"My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,"
11840,11841,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.6.5,KING HENRY VI,At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
11841,11842,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.6.6,Lieutenant,"Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns,"
11842,11843,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.6.7,Lieutenant,"But if an humble prayer may prevail,"
11843,11844,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.6.8,Lieutenant,I then crave pardon of your majesty.
11844,11845,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.9,KING HENRY VI,"For what, lieutenant? for well using me?"
11845,11846,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.10,KING HENRY VI,"Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,"
11846,11847,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.11,KING HENRY VI,"For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure,"
11847,11848,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.12,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds"
11848,11849,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.13,KING HENRY VI,Conceive when after many moody thoughts
11849,11850,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.14,KING HENRY VI,At last by notes of household harmony
11850,11851,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.15,KING HENRY VI,They quite forget their loss of liberty.
11851,11852,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.16,KING HENRY VI,"But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,"
11852,11853,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.17,KING HENRY VI,"And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee,"
11853,11854,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.18,KING HENRY VI,"He was the author, thou the instrument."
11854,11855,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.19,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite"
11855,11856,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.20,KING HENRY VI,"By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,"
11856,11857,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.21,KING HENRY VI,And that the people of this blessed land
11857,11858,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.22,KING HENRY VI,"May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,"
11858,11859,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.23,KING HENRY VI,"Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,"
11859,11860,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.24,KING HENRY VI,"I here resign my government to thee,"
11860,11861,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.6.25,KING HENRY VI,For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
11861,11862,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.6.26,WARWICK,"Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous,"
11862,11863,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.6.27,WARWICK,"And now may seem as wise as virtuous,"
11863,11864,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.6.28,WARWICK,"By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,"
11864,11865,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.6.29,WARWICK,For few men rightly temper with the stars:
11865,11866,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.6.30,WARWICK,"Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,"
11866,11867,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.6.31,WARWICK,For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
11867,11868,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.6.32,CLARENCE,"No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,"
11868,11869,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.6.33,CLARENCE,To whom the heavens in thy nativity
11869,11870,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.6.34,CLARENCE,"Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,"
11870,11871,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.6.35,CLARENCE,"As likely to be blest in peace and war,"
11871,11872,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.6.36,CLARENCE,And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
11872,11873,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.6.37,WARWICK,And I choose Clarence only for protector.
11873,11874,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.6.38,KING HENRY VI,Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
11874,11875,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.6.39,KING HENRY VI,"Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,"
11875,11876,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.6.40,KING HENRY VI,That no dissension hinder government:
11876,11877,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.6.41,KING HENRY VI,"I make you both protectors of this land,"
11877,11878,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.6.42,KING HENRY VI,While I myself will lead a private life
11878,11879,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.6.43,KING HENRY VI,"And in devotion spend my latter days,"
11879,11880,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.6.44,KING HENRY VI,To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
11880,11881,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.6.45,WARWICK,What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
11881,11882,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.6.46,CLARENCE,"That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,"
11882,11883,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.6.47,CLARENCE,For on thy fortune I repose myself.
11883,11884,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.48,WARWICK,"Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:"
11884,11885,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.49,WARWICK,"We'll yoke together, like a double shadow"
11885,11886,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.50,WARWICK,"To Henry's body, and supply his place,"
11886,11887,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.51,WARWICK,"I mean, in bearing weight of government,"
11887,11888,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.52,WARWICK,While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
11888,11889,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.53,WARWICK,"And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful"
11889,11890,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.54,WARWICK,"Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,"
11890,11891,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.6.55,WARWICK,And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
11891,11892,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.6.56,CLARENCE,What else? and that succession be determined.
11892,11893,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.6.57,WARWICK,"Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part."
11893,11894,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.6.58,KING HENRY VI,"But, with the first of all your chief affairs,"
11894,11895,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.6.59,KING HENRY VI,"Let me entreat, for I command no more,"
11895,11896,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.6.60,KING HENRY VI,That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
11896,11897,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.6.61,KING HENRY VI,"Be sent for, to return from France with speed,"
11897,11898,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.6.62,KING HENRY VI,"For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear"
11898,11899,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.6.63,KING HENRY VI,My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
11899,11900,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.6.64,CLARENCE,"It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed."
11900,11901,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,4.6.65,KING HENRY VI,"My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,"
11901,11902,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,4.6.66,KING HENRY VI,Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
11902,11903,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.6.67,SOMERSET,"My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond."
11903,11904,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.68,KING HENRY VI,"Come hither, England's hope."
11904,11905,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,,KING HENRY VI,Lays his hand on his head
11905,11906,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.69,KING HENRY VI,If secret powers
11906,11907,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.70,KING HENRY VI,"Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,"
11907,11908,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.71,KING HENRY VI,This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
11908,11909,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.72,KING HENRY VI,"His looks are full of peaceful majesty,"
11909,11910,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.73,KING HENRY VI,"His head by nature framed to wear a crown,"
11910,11911,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.74,KING HENRY VI,"His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself"
11911,11912,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.75,KING HENRY VI,Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
11912,11913,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.76,KING HENRY VI,"Make much of him, my lords, for this is he"
11913,11914,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.6.77,KING HENRY VI,Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
11914,11915,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,,KING HENRY VI,Enter a Post
11915,11916,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.6.78,WARWICK,"What news, my friend?"
11916,11917,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.6.79,Post,"That Edward is escaped from your brother,"
11917,11918,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.6.80,Post,"And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy."
11918,11919,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.6.81,WARWICK,Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
11919,11920,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.6.82,Post,He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
11920,11921,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.6.83,Post,"And the Lord Hastings, who attended him"
11921,11922,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.6.84,Post,In secret ambush on the forest side
11922,11923,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.6.85,Post,"And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him,"
11923,11924,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.6.86,Post,For hunting was his daily exercise.
11924,11925,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.6.87,WARWICK,My brother was too careless of his charge.
11925,11926,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.6.88,WARWICK,"But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide"
11926,11927,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.6.89,WARWICK,A salve for any sore that may betide.
11927,11928,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,,WARWICK,"Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD"
11928,11929,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.90,SOMERSET,"My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's,"
11929,11930,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.91,SOMERSET,"For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,"
11930,11931,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.92,SOMERSET,And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
11931,11932,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.93,SOMERSET,As Henry's late presaging prophecy
11932,11933,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.94,SOMERSET,"Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,"
11933,11934,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.95,SOMERSET,"So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts"
11934,11935,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.96,SOMERSET,"What may befall him, to his harm and ours:"
11935,11936,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.97,SOMERSET,"Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,"
11936,11937,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.98,SOMERSET,"Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,"
11937,11938,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.6.99,SOMERSET,Till storms be past of civil enmity.
11938,11939,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,4.6.100,OXFORD,"Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,"
11939,11940,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,4.6.101,OXFORD,'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
11940,11941,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.6.102,SOMERSET,"It shall be so, he shall to Brittany."
11941,11942,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.6.103,SOMERSET,"Come, therefore, let's about it speedily."
11942,11943,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,,SOMERSET,Exeunt

11945,11946,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.1,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,"
11946,11947,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.2,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,"
11947,11948,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.3,KING EDWARD IV,And says that once more I shall interchange
11948,11949,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.4,KING EDWARD IV,My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
11949,11950,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.5,KING EDWARD IV,Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
11950,11951,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.6,KING EDWARD IV,And brought desired help from Burgundy:
11951,11952,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.7,KING EDWARD IV,"What then remains, we being thus arrived"
11952,11953,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.8,KING EDWARD IV,"From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,"
11953,11954,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,4.7.9,KING EDWARD IV,"But that we enter, as into our dukedom?"
11954,11955,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.7.10,GLOUCESTER,"The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this,"
11955,11956,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.7.11,GLOUCESTER,For many men that stumble at the threshold
11956,11957,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,4.7.12,GLOUCESTER,Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
11957,11958,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.7.13,KING EDWARD IV,"Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:"
11958,11959,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.7.14,KING EDWARD IV,"By fair or foul means we must enter in,"
11959,11960,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,4.7.15,KING EDWARD IV,For hither will our friends repair to us.
11960,11961,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,4.7.16,HASTINGS,"My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them."
11961,11962,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,,HASTINGS,"Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren"
11962,11963,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.7.17,Mayor,"My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,"
11963,11964,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.7.18,Mayor,"And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,"
11964,11965,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,4.7.19,Mayor,For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
11965,11966,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.7.20,KING EDWARD IV,"But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,"
11966,11967,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,4.7.21,KING EDWARD IV,Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
11967,11968,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,4.7.22,Mayor,"True, my good lord, I know you for no less."
11968,11969,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.7.23,KING EDWARD IV,"Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,"
11969,11970,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,4.7.24,KING EDWARD IV,As being well content with that alone.
11970,11971,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.7.25,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,"
11971,11972,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,4.7.26,GLOUCESTER,He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
11972,11973,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.7.27,HASTINGS,"Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?"
11973,11974,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,4.7.28,HASTINGS,"Open the gates, we are King Henry's friends."
11974,11975,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,4.7.29,Mayor,"Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd."
11975,11976,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,,Mayor,They descend
11976,11977,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.7.30,GLOUCESTER,"A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!"
11977,11978,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.7.31,HASTINGS,"The good old man would fain that all were well,"
11978,11979,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.7.32,HASTINGS,"So 'twere not 'long of him, but being enter'd,"
11979,11980,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.7.33,HASTINGS,"I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade"
11980,11981,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.7.34,HASTINGS,Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

11982,11983,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.7.35,KING EDWARD IV,"So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut"
11983,11984,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.7.36,KING EDWARD IV,But in the night or in the time of war.
11984,11985,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.7.37,KING EDWARD IV,"What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys,"
11985,11986,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,,KING EDWARD IV,Takes his keys
11986,11987,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.7.38,KING EDWARD IV,"For Edward will defend the town and thee,"
11987,11988,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.7.39,KING EDWARD IV,And all those friends that deign to follow me.
11988,11989,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,,KING EDWARD IV,"March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers"
11989,11990,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,4.7.40,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,"
11990,11991,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,4.7.41,GLOUCESTER,"Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived."
11991,11992,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.7.42,KING EDWARD IV,"Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?"
11992,11993,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.7.43,MONTAGUE,"To help King Edward in his time of storm,"
11993,11994,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.7.44,MONTAGUE,As every loyal subject ought to do.
11994,11995,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.7.45,KING EDWARD IV,"Thanks, good Montgomery, but we now forget"
11995,11996,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.7.46,KING EDWARD IV,Our title to the crown and only claim
11996,11997,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,4.7.47,KING EDWARD IV,Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
11997,11998,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.7.48,MONTAGUE,"Then fare you well, for I will hence again:"
11998,11999,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.7.49,MONTAGUE,I came to serve a king and not a duke.
11999,12000,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,4.7.50,MONTAGUE,"Drummer, strike up, and let us march away."
12000,12001,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,,MONTAGUE,The drum begins to march
12001,12002,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.7.51,KING EDWARD IV,"Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debate"
12002,12003,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,4.7.52,KING EDWARD IV,By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
12003,12004,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.7.53,MONTAGUE,"What talk you of debating? in few words,"
12004,12005,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.7.54,MONTAGUE,"If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,"
12005,12006,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.7.55,MONTAGUE,I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
12006,12007,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.7.56,MONTAGUE,To keep them back that come to succor you:
12007,12008,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,4.7.57,MONTAGUE,"Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?"
12008,12009,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,4.7.58,GLOUCESTER,"Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?"
12009,12010,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.7.59,KING EDWARD IV,"When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:"
12010,12011,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,4.7.60,KING EDWARD IV,"Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning."
12011,12012,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,4.7.61,HASTINGS,Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
12012,12013,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.7.62,GLOUCESTER,And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
12013,12014,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.7.63,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:"
12014,12015,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,4.7.64,GLOUCESTER,The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
12015,12016,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,4.7.65,KING EDWARD IV,"Then be it as you will, for 'tis my right,"
12016,12017,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,4.7.66,KING EDWARD IV,And Henry but usurps the diadem.
12017,12018,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.7.67,MONTAGUE,"Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself,"
12018,12019,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,4.7.68,MONTAGUE,And now will I be Edward's champion.
12019,12020,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.7.69,HASTINGS,"Sound trumpet, Edward shall be here proclaim'd:"
12020,12021,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,4.7.70,HASTINGS,"Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation."
12021,12022,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,,HASTINGS,Flourish
12022,12023,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,4.7.71,Soldier,"Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of"

12024,12025,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,4.7.73,MONTAGUE,"And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,"
12025,12026,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,4.7.74,MONTAGUE,By this I challenge him to single fight.
12026,12027,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,,MONTAGUE,Throws down his gauntlet
12027,12028,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,4.7.75,All,Long live Edward the Fourth!

12029,12030,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.77,KING EDWARD IV,"If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness."
12030,12031,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.78,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York,"
12031,12032,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.79,KING EDWARD IV,And when the morning sun shall raise his car
12032,12033,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.80,KING EDWARD IV,"Above the border of this horizon,"
12033,12034,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.81,KING EDWARD IV,"We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates,"
12034,12035,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.82,KING EDWARD IV,For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
12035,12036,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.83,KING EDWARD IV,"Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee"
12036,12037,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.84,KING EDWARD IV,To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
12037,12038,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.85,KING EDWARD IV,"Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick."
12038,12039,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.86,KING EDWARD IV,"Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,"
12039,12040,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,4.7.87,KING EDWARD IV,"And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay."

12077,12078,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.8.34,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?"
12078,12079,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.8.35,KING HENRY VI,Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
12079,12080,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,4.8.36,KING HENRY VI,Should not be able to encounter mine.
12080,12081,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,4.8.37,EXETER,The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
12081,12082,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.8.38,KING HENRY VI,"That's not my fear, my meed hath got me fame:"

12089,12090,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.8.46,KING HENRY VI,"Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:"
12090,12091,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.8.47,KING HENRY VI,Then why should they love Edward more than me?
12091,12092,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.8.48,KING HENRY VI,"No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:"
12092,12093,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.8.49,KING HENRY VI,"And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,"
12093,12094,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.8.50,KING HENRY VI,The lamb will never cease to follow him.
12094,12095,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,4.8.50,KING HENRY VI,Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!'

12098,12099,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.8.53,KING EDWARD IV,And once again proclaim us King of England.
12099,12100,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.8.54,KING EDWARD IV,You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
12100,12101,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.8.55,KING EDWARD IV,"Now stops thy spring, my sea sha$l suck them dry,"
12101,12102,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,4.8.56,KING EDWARD IV,And swell so much the higher by their ebb.

12108,12109,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.8.62,GLOUCESTER,"Away betimes, before his forces join,"
12109,12110,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.8.63,GLOUCESTER,And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
12110,12111,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,4.8.64,GLOUCESTER,"Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry."

12136,12137,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.1.19,WARWICK,"Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,"
12137,12138,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.1.20,WARWICK,That we could hear no news of his repair?
12138,12139,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,5.1.21,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,"
12139,12140,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,5.1.22,KING EDWARD IV,"Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,"
12140,12141,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,5.1.23,KING EDWARD IV,Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
12141,12142,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,5.1.24,KING EDWARD IV,And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
12142,12143,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.1.25,WARWICK,"Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,"
12143,12144,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.1.26,WARWICK,"Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,"
12144,12145,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.1.27,WARWICK,Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
12145,12146,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.1.28,WARWICK,And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
12146,12147,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,5.1.29,GLOUCESTER,"I thought, at least, he would have said the king,"
12147,12148,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,5.1.30,GLOUCESTER,Or did he make the jest against his will?
12148,12149,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,5.1.31,WARWICK,"Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?"
12149,12150,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,5.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:"
12150,12151,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,5.1.33,GLOUCESTER,I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
12151,12152,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,5.1.34,WARWICK,'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
12152,12153,Henry VI Part 3,20.0,5.1.35,KING EDWARD IV,"Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift."
12153,12154,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,5.1.36,WARWICK,Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
12154,12155,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,5.1.37,WARWICK,"And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again,"
12155,12156,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,5.1.38,WARWICK,"And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject."
12156,12157,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,5.1.39,KING EDWARD IV,But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
12157,12158,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,5.1.40,KING EDWARD IV,"And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:"
12158,12159,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,5.1.41,KING EDWARD IV,What is the body when the head is off?
12159,12160,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,5.1.42,GLOUCESTER,"Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,"
12160,12161,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,5.1.43,GLOUCESTER,"But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,"
12161,12162,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,5.1.44,GLOUCESTER,The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
12162,12163,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,5.1.45,GLOUCESTER,"You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,"
12163,12164,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,5.1.46,GLOUCESTER,"And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower."
12164,12165,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,5.1.47,EDWARD,"'Tis even so, yet you are Warwick still."
12165,12166,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,5.1.48,GLOUCESTER,"Come, Warwick, take the time, kneel down, kneel down:"
12166,12167,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,5.1.49,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools."
12167,12168,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,5.1.50,WARWICK,"I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,"
12168,12169,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,5.1.51,WARWICK,"And with the other fling it at thy face,"
12169,12170,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,5.1.52,WARWICK,"Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee."
12170,12171,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.1.53,KING EDWARD IV,"Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,"
12171,12172,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.1.54,KING EDWARD IV,"This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair"
12172,12173,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.1.55,KING EDWARD IV,"Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,"
12173,12174,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.1.56,KING EDWARD IV,"Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,"
12174,12175,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.1.57,KING EDWARD IV,'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
12175,12176,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,,KING EDWARD IV,"Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours"
12176,12177,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,5.1.58,WARWICK,O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
12177,12178,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,5.1.59,OXFORD,"Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!"
12178,12179,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,,OXFORD,He and his forces enter the city
12179,12180,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.1.60,GLOUCESTER,"The gates are open, let us enter too."
12180,12181,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,5.1.61,KING EDWARD IV,So other foes may set upon our backs.
12181,12182,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,5.1.62,KING EDWARD IV,"Stand we in good array, for they no doubt"
12182,12183,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,5.1.63,KING EDWARD IV,Will issue out again and bid us battle:
12183,12184,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,5.1.64,KING EDWARD IV,"If not, the city being but of small defence,"
12184,12185,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,5.1.65,KING EDWARD IV,We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
12185,12186,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,5.1.66,WARWICK,"O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help."
12186,12187,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,,WARWICK,Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours
12187,12188,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,5.1.67,MONTAGUE,"Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!"
12188,12189,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,,MONTAGUE,He and his forces enter the city
12189,12190,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,5.1.68,GLOUCESTER,Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
12190,12191,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,5.1.69,GLOUCESTER,Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
12191,12192,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,5.1.70,KING EDWARD IV,"The harder match'd, the greater victory:"
12192,12193,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,5.1.71,KING EDWARD IV,My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
12193,12194,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,,KING EDWARD IV,"Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours"
12194,12195,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,5.1.72,SOMERSET,"Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!"
12195,12196,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,,SOMERSET,He and his forces enter the city
12196,12197,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,5.1.73,GLOUCESTER,"Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,"
12197,12198,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,5.1.74,GLOUCESTER,"Have sold their lives unto the house of York,"
12198,12199,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,5.1.75,GLOUCESTER,And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
12199,12200,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours"
12200,12201,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,5.1.76,WARWICK,"And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,"
12201,12202,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,5.1.77,WARWICK,"Of force enough to bid his brother battle,"
12202,12203,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,5.1.78,WARWICK,With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
12203,12204,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,5.1.79,WARWICK,More than the nature of a brother's love!
12204,12205,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,5.1.80,WARWICK,"Come, Clarence, come, thou wilt, if Warwick call."
12205,12206,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.81,CLARENCE,"Father of Warwick, know you what this means?"
12206,12207,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,,CLARENCE,Taking his red rose out of his hat
12207,12208,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.82,CLARENCE,"Look here, I throw my infamy at thee"
12208,12209,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.83,CLARENCE,"I will not ruinate my father's house,"
12209,12210,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.84,CLARENCE,"Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,"
12210,12211,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.85,CLARENCE,"And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,"
12211,12212,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.86,CLARENCE,"That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,"
12212,12213,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.87,CLARENCE,To bend the fatal instruments of war
12213,12214,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.88,CLARENCE,Against his brother and his lawful king?
12214,12215,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.89,CLARENCE,Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
12215,12216,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.90,CLARENCE,To keep that oath were more impiety
12216,12217,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.91,CLARENCE,"Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter."
12217,12218,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.92,CLARENCE,I am so sorry for my trespass made
12218,12219,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.93,CLARENCE,"That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,"
12219,12220,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.94,CLARENCE,"I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,"
12220,12221,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.95,CLARENCE,"With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--"
12221,12222,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.96,CLARENCE,"As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--"
12222,12223,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.97,CLARENCE,To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
12223,12224,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.98,CLARENCE,"And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,"
12224,12225,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.99,CLARENCE,And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
12225,12226,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.100,CLARENCE,"Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:"
12226,12227,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.101,CLARENCE,"And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,"
12227,12228,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.1.102,CLARENCE,For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
12228,12229,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,5.1.103,KING EDWARD IV,"Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,"
12229,12230,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,5.1.104,KING EDWARD IV,Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
12230,12231,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,5.1.105,GLOUCESTER,"Welcome, good Clarence, this is brotherlike."
12231,12232,Henry VI Part 3,42.0,5.1.106,WARWICK,"O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!"
12232,12233,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,5.1.107,KING EDWARD IV,"What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?"
12233,12234,Henry VI Part 3,43.0,5.1.108,KING EDWARD IV,Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
12234,12235,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,5.1.109,WARWICK,"Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!"
12235,12236,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,5.1.110,WARWICK,"I will away towards Barnet presently,"
12236,12237,Henry VI Part 3,44.0,5.1.111,WARWICK,"And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest."
12237,12238,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,5.1.112,KING EDWARD IV,"Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way."
12238,12239,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,5.1.113,KING EDWARD IV,"Lords, to the field, Saint George and victory!"
12239,12240,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follow
12240,12241,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,,KING EDWARD IV,SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet.
12241,12242,Henry VI Part 3,45.0,,KING EDWARD IV,"Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV, bringing forth WARWICK wounded"
12242,12243,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.2.1,KING EDWARD IV,"So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear,"
12243,12244,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.2.2,KING EDWARD IV,For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
12244,12245,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.2.3,KING EDWARD IV,"Now, Montague, sit fast, I seek for thee,"
12245,12246,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.2.4,KING EDWARD IV,That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
12246,12247,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,,KING EDWARD IV,Exit
12247,12248,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.5,WARWICK,"Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,"
12248,12249,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.6,WARWICK,"And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?"
12249,12250,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.7,WARWICK,"Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,"
12250,12251,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.8,WARWICK,"My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows."
12251,12252,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.9,WARWICK,That I must yield my body to the earth
12252,12253,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.10,WARWICK,"And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe."
12253,12254,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.11,WARWICK,"Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,"
12254,12255,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.12,WARWICK,"Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,"
12255,12256,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.13,WARWICK,"Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,"
12256,12257,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.14,WARWICK,Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
12257,12258,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.15,WARWICK,And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
12258,12259,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.16,WARWICK,"These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,"
12259,12260,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.17,WARWICK,"Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,"
12260,12261,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.18,WARWICK,To search the secret treasons of the world:
12261,12262,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.19,WARWICK,"The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,"
12262,12263,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.20,WARWICK,"Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres,"
12263,12264,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.21,WARWICK,"For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?"
12264,12265,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.22,WARWICK,And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
12265,12266,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.23,WARWICK,"Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!"
12266,12267,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.24,WARWICK,"My parks, my walks, my manors that I had."
12267,12268,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.25,WARWICK,"Even now forsake me, and of all my lands"
12268,12269,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.26,WARWICK,Is nothing left me but my body's length.
12269,12270,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.27,WARWICK,"Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?"
12270,12271,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.2.28,WARWICK,"And, live we how we can, yet die we must."
12271,12272,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,,WARWICK,Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
12272,12273,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.2.29,SOMERSET,"Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are."
12273,12274,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.2.30,SOMERSET,"We might recover all our loss again,"
12274,12275,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.2.31,SOMERSET,The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
12275,12276,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.2.32,SOMERSET,"Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!"
12276,12277,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.2.33,WARWICK,"Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,"
12277,12278,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.2.34,WARWICK,"If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand."
12278,12279,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.2.35,WARWICK,And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
12279,12280,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.2.36,WARWICK,"Thou lovest me not, for, brother, if thou didst,"
12280,12281,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.2.37,WARWICK,Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
12281,12282,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.2.38,WARWICK,That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
12282,12283,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.2.39,WARWICK,"Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead."
12283,12284,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.40,SOMERSET,"Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last,"
12284,12285,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.41,SOMERSET,"And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,"
12285,12286,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.42,SOMERSET,And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
12286,12287,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.43,SOMERSET,"And more he would have said, and more he spoke,"
12287,12288,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.44,SOMERSET,"Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,"
12288,12289,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.45,SOMERSET,"That mought not be distinguished, but at last"
12289,12290,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.46,SOMERSET,"I well might hear, delivered with a groan,"
12290,12291,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.2.47,SOMERSET,"'O, farewell, Warwick!'"
12291,12292,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.2.48,WARWICK,"Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves,"
12292,12293,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.2.49,WARWICK,For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
12293,12294,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,,WARWICK,Dies
12294,12295,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.2.50,OXFORD,"Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!"
12295,12296,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,,OXFORD,Here they bear away his body. Exeunt
12296,12297,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,,OXFORD,SCENE III. Another part of the field.
12297,12298,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,,OXFORD,"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph, with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest"

12299,12300,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.2,KING EDWARD IV,And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
12300,12301,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.3,KING EDWARD IV,"But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,"
12301,12302,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.4,KING EDWARD IV,"I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,"
12302,12303,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.5,KING EDWARD IV,"That will encounter with our glorious sun,"
12303,12304,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.6,KING EDWARD IV,Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
12304,12305,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.7,KING EDWARD IV,"I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen"
12305,12306,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.8,KING EDWARD IV,Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
12306,12307,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.3.9,KING EDWARD IV,"And, as we hear, march on to fight with us."
12307,12308,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.3.10,CLARENCE,A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
12308,12309,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.3.11,CLARENCE,And blow it to the source from whence it came:
12309,12310,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.3.12,CLARENCE,"The very beams will dry those vapours up,"
12310,12311,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.3.13,CLARENCE,For every cloud engenders not a storm.
12311,12312,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.3.14,GLOUCESTER,"The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,"
12312,12313,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.3.15,GLOUCESTER,"And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:"
12313,12314,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.3.16,GLOUCESTER,If she have time to breathe be well assured
12314,12315,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.3.17,GLOUCESTER,Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
12315,12316,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.3.18,KING EDWARD IV,We are advertised by our loving friends
12316,12317,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.3.19,KING EDWARD IV,That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
12317,12318,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.3.20,KING EDWARD IV,"We, having now the best at Barnet field,"
12318,12319,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.3.21,KING EDWARD IV,"Will thither straight, for willingness rids way,"
12319,12320,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.3.22,KING EDWARD IV,"And, as we march, our strength will be augmented"
12320,12321,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.3.23,KING EDWARD IV,In every county as we go along.
12321,12322,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.3.24,KING EDWARD IV,"Strike up the drum, cry 'Courage!' and away."
12322,12323,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,,KING EDWARD IV,Exeunt
12323,12324,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,,KING EDWARD IV,SCENE IV. Plains near Tewksbury.
12324,12325,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,,KING EDWARD IV,"March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and soldiers"
12325,12326,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.1,QUEEN MARGARET,"Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,"
12326,12327,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.2,QUEEN MARGARET,But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
12327,12328,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.3,QUEEN MARGARET,"What though the mast be now blown overboard,"
12328,12329,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.4,QUEEN MARGARET,"The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,"
12329,12330,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.5,QUEEN MARGARET,And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
12330,12331,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.6,QUEEN MARGARET,Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
12331,12332,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.7,QUEEN MARGARET,Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
12332,12333,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.8,QUEEN MARGARET,With tearful eyes add water to the sea
12333,12334,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.9,QUEEN MARGARET,"And give more strength to that which hath too much,"
12334,12335,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.10,QUEEN MARGARET,"Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,"
12335,12336,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.11,QUEEN MARGARET,Which industry and courage might have saved?
12336,12337,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.12,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!"
12337,12338,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.13,QUEEN MARGARET,"Say Warwick was our anchor, what of that?"
12338,12339,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.14,QUEEN MARGARET,"And Montague our topmost, what of him?"
12339,12340,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.15,QUEEN MARGARET,"Our slaughter'd friends the tackles, what of these?"
12340,12341,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.16,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?"
12341,12342,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.17,QUEEN MARGARET,And Somerset another goodly mast?
12342,12343,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.18,QUEEN MARGARET,The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
12343,12344,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.19,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I"
12344,12345,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.20,QUEEN MARGARET,For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
12345,12346,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.21,QUEEN MARGARET,"We will not from the helm to sit and weep,"
12346,12347,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.22,QUEEN MARGARET,"But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,"
12347,12348,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.23,QUEEN MARGARET,From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
12348,12349,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.24,QUEEN MARGARET,As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
12349,12350,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.25,QUEEN MARGARET,And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
12350,12351,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.26,QUEEN MARGARET,What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
12351,12352,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.27,QUEEN MARGARET,And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
12352,12353,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.28,QUEEN MARGARET,All these the enemies to our poor bark.
12353,12354,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.29,QUEEN MARGARET,"Say you can swim, alas, 'tis but a while!"
12354,12355,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.30,QUEEN MARGARET,"Tread on the sand, why, there you quickly sink:"
12355,12356,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.31,QUEEN MARGARET,"Bestride the rock, the tide will wash you off,"
12356,12357,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.32,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or else you famish, that's a threefold death."
12357,12358,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.33,QUEEN MARGARET,"This speak I, lords, to let you understand,"
12358,12359,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.34,QUEEN MARGARET,"If case some one of you would fly from us,"
12359,12360,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.35,QUEEN MARGARET,That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
12360,12361,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.36,QUEEN MARGARET,"More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks."
12361,12362,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.37,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided"
12362,12363,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.4.38,QUEEN MARGARET,'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
12363,12364,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.39,PRINCE EDWARD,Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
12364,12365,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.40,PRINCE EDWARD,"Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,"
12365,12366,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.41,PRINCE EDWARD,Infuse his breast with magnanimity
12366,12367,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.42,PRINCE EDWARD,"And make him, naked, foil a man at arms."
12367,12368,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.43,PRINCE EDWARD,I speak not this as doubting any here
12368,12369,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.44,PRINCE EDWARD,For did I but suspect a fearful man
12369,12370,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.45,PRINCE EDWARD,"He should have leave to go away betimes,"
12370,12371,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.46,PRINCE EDWARD,Lest in our need he might infect another
12371,12372,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.47,PRINCE EDWARD,And make him of like spirit to himself.
12372,12373,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.48,PRINCE EDWARD,If any such be here--as God forbid!--
12373,12374,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.4.49,PRINCE EDWARD,Let him depart before we need his help.
12374,12375,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.4.50,OXFORD,"Women and children of so high a courage,"
12375,12376,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.4.51,OXFORD,"And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame."
12376,12377,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.4.52,OXFORD,O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
12377,12378,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.4.53,OXFORD,Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
12378,12379,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.4.54,OXFORD,To bear his image and renew his glories!
12379,12380,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.4.55,SOMERSET,And he that will not fight for such a hope.
12380,12381,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.4.56,SOMERSET,"Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,"
12381,12382,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.4.57,SOMERSET,"If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at."
12382,12383,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.4.58,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thanks, gentle Somerset, sweet Oxford, thanks."
12383,12384,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.4.59,PRINCE EDWARD,And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
12384,12385,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,,PRINCE EDWARD,Enter a Messenger
12385,12386,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.4.60,Messenger,"Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand."
12386,12387,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.4.61,Messenger,"Ready to fight, therefore be resolute."
12387,12388,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.4.62,OXFORD,I thought no less: it is his policy
12388,12389,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.4.63,OXFORD,"To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided."
12389,12390,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,5.4.64,SOMERSET,"But he's deceived, we are in readiness."
12390,12391,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,5.4.65,QUEEN MARGARET,"This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness."
12391,12392,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,5.4.66,OXFORD,"Here pitch our battle, hence we will not budge."
12392,12393,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,,OXFORD,"Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers"
12393,12394,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.4.67,KING EDWARD IV,"Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,"
12394,12395,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.4.68,KING EDWARD IV,"Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,"
12395,12396,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.4.69,KING EDWARD IV,Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
12396,12397,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.4.70,KING EDWARD IV,"I need not add more fuel to your fire,"
12397,12398,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.4.71,KING EDWARD IV,For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
12398,12399,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.4.72,KING EDWARD IV,"Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!"
12399,12400,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.73,QUEEN MARGARET,"Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say"
12400,12401,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"My tears gainsay, for every word I speak,"
12401,12402,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes."
12402,12403,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,"
12403,12404,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is prisoner to the foe, his state usurp'd,"
12404,12405,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,"
12405,12406,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent,"
12406,12407,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.80,QUEEN MARGARET,And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
12407,12408,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,"
12408,12409,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.4.82,QUEEN MARGARET,Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
12409,12410,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Alarum. Retreat. Excursions. Exeunt
12410,12411,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,SCENE V. Another part of the field.

12412,12413,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.5.1,KING EDWARD IV,Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
12413,12414,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.5.2,KING EDWARD IV,Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
12414,12415,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.5.3,KING EDWARD IV,"For Somerset, off with his guilty head."
12415,12416,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.5.4,KING EDWARD IV,"Go, bear them hence, I will not hear them speak."
12416,12417,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.5.5,OXFORD,"For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words."
12417,12418,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.5.6,SOMERSET,"Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune."
12418,12419,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,,SOMERSET,"Exeunt Oxford and Somerset, guarded"
12419,12420,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.5.7,QUEEN MARGARET,"So part we sadly in this troublous world,"
12420,12421,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.5.8,QUEEN MARGARET,To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
12421,12422,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.5.9,KING EDWARD IV,"Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward"
12422,12423,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.5.10,KING EDWARD IV,"Shall have a high reward, and he his life?"
12423,12424,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.5.11,GLOUCESTER,"It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!"
12424,12425,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD"
12425,12426,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.5.12,KING EDWARD IV,"Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak."
12426,12427,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.5.13,KING EDWARD IV,What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
12427,12428,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.5.14,KING EDWARD IV,"Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make"
12428,12429,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.5.15,KING EDWARD IV,"For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,"
12429,12430,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.5.16,KING EDWARD IV,And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
12430,12431,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.5.17,PRINCE EDWARD,"Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!"
12431,12432,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.5.18,PRINCE EDWARD,"Suppose that I am now my father's mouth,"
12432,12433,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.5.19,PRINCE EDWARD,"Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,"
12433,12434,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.5.20,PRINCE EDWARD,"Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,"
12434,12435,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.5.21,PRINCE EDWARD,"Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to."
12435,12436,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,5.5.22,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!"
12436,12437,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,5.5.23,GLOUCESTER,"That you might still have worn the petticoat,"
12437,12438,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,5.5.24,GLOUCESTER,And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
12438,12439,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,5.5.25,PRINCE EDWARD,"Let AEsop fable in a winter's night,"
12439,12440,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,5.5.26,PRINCE EDWARD,His currish riddles sort not with this place.
12440,12441,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.5.27,GLOUCESTER,"By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word."
12441,12442,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.5.28,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men."
12442,12443,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,5.5.29,GLOUCESTER,"For God's sake, take away this captive scold."
12443,12444,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.5.30,PRINCE EDWARD,"Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather."
12444,12445,Henry VI Part 3,16.0,5.5.31,KING EDWARD IV,"Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue."
12445,12446,Henry VI Part 3,17.0,5.5.32,CLARENCE,"Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert."

12447,12448,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,5.5.34,PRINCE EDWARD,"Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,"
12448,12449,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,5.5.35,PRINCE EDWARD,"And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all"
12449,12450,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,5.5.36,PRINCE EDWARD,"I am your better, traitors as ye are:"
12450,12451,Henry VI Part 3,18.0,5.5.37,PRINCE EDWARD,And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
12451,12452,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,5.5.38,KING EDWARD IV,"Take that, thou likeness of this railer here."
12452,12453,Henry VI Part 3,19.0,,KING EDWARD IV,Stabs him

12455,12456,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,5.5.40,CLARENCE,And there's for twitting me with perjury.
12456,12457,Henry VI Part 3,21.0,,CLARENCE,Stabs him
12457,12458,Henry VI Part 3,22.0,5.5.41,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, kill me too!"
12458,12459,Henry VI Part 3,23.0,5.5.42,GLOUCESTER,"Marry, and shall."

12460,12461,Henry VI Part 3,24.0,5.5.43,KING EDWARD IV,"Hold, Richard, hold, for we have done too much."
12461,12462,Henry VI Part 3,25.0,5.5.44,GLOUCESTER,"Why should she live, to fill the world with words?"
12462,12463,Henry VI Part 3,26.0,5.5.45,KING EDWARD IV,"What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery."
12463,12464,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.5.46,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother,"
12464,12465,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.5.47,GLOUCESTER,I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
12465,12466,Henry VI Part 3,27.0,5.5.48,GLOUCESTER,"Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news."
12466,12467,Henry VI Part 3,28.0,5.5.49,CLARENCE,What? what?
12467,12468,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,5.5.50,GLOUCESTER,"The Tower, the Tower."
12468,12469,Henry VI Part 3,29.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit
12469,12470,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.51,QUEEN MARGARET,"O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!"
12470,12471,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.52,QUEEN MARGARET,Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
12471,12472,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.53,QUEEN MARGARET,"They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,"
12472,12473,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.54,QUEEN MARGARET,"Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,"
12473,12474,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.55,QUEEN MARGARET,If this foul deed were by to equal it:
12474,12475,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.56,QUEEN MARGARET,"He was a man, this, in respect, a child:"
12475,12476,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.57,QUEEN MARGARET,And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
12476,12477,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.58,QUEEN MARGARET,"What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?"
12477,12478,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.59,QUEEN MARGARET,"No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:"
12478,12479,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"And I will speak, that so my heart may burst."
12479,12480,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.61,QUEEN MARGARET,Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
12480,12481,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.62,QUEEN MARGARET,How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
12481,12482,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.63,QUEEN MARGARET,"You have no children, butchers! if you had,"
12482,12483,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.64,QUEEN MARGARET,The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
12483,12484,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.65,QUEEN MARGARET,"But if you ever chance to have a child,"
12484,12485,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.66,QUEEN MARGARET,Look in his youth to have him so cut off
12485,12486,Henry VI Part 3,30.0,5.5.67,QUEEN MARGARET,"As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!"
12486,12487,Henry VI Part 3,31.0,5.5.68,KING EDWARD IV,"Away with her, go, bear her hence perforce."
12487,12488,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,5.5.69,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,"
12488,12489,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,5.5.70,QUEEN MARGARET,"Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:"
12489,12490,Henry VI Part 3,32.0,5.5.71,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou."
12490,12491,Henry VI Part 3,33.0,5.5.72,CLARENCE,"By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease."
12491,12492,Henry VI Part 3,34.0,5.5.73,QUEEN MARGARET,"Good Clarence, do, sweet Clarence, do thou do it."
12492,12493,Henry VI Part 3,35.0,5.5.74,CLARENCE,Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
12493,12494,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,5.5.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:"
12494,12495,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,5.5.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity."
12495,12496,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,5.5.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,"
12496,12497,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,5.5.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?"
12497,12498,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,5.5.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed,"
12498,12499,Henry VI Part 3,36.0,5.5.80,QUEEN MARGARET,Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
12499,12500,Henry VI Part 3,37.0,5.5.81,KING EDWARD IV,"Away, I say, I charge ye, bear her hence."
12500,12501,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,5.5.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!"
12501,12502,Henry VI Part 3,38.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,"Exit, led out forcibly"
12502,12503,Henry VI Part 3,39.0,5.5.83,KING EDWARD IV,Where's Richard gone?
12503,12504,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,5.5.84,CLARENCE,"To London, all in post, and, as I guess,"
12504,12505,Henry VI Part 3,40.0,5.5.85,CLARENCE,To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
12505,12506,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,5.5.86,KING EDWARD IV,"He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head."
12506,12507,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,5.5.87,KING EDWARD IV,Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
12507,12508,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,5.5.88,KING EDWARD IV,"With pay and thanks, and let's away to London"
12508,12509,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,5.5.89,KING EDWARD IV,And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
12509,12510,Henry VI Part 3,41.0,5.5.90,KING EDWARD IV,"By this, I hope, she hath a son for me."

12513,12514,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.6.1,GLOUCESTER,"Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?"
12514,12515,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.6.2,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather,"
12515,12516,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.6.3,KING HENRY VI,"'Tis sin to flatter, 'good' was little better:"
12516,12517,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.6.4,KING HENRY VI,"'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,"
12517,12518,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.6.5,KING HENRY VI,"And both preposterous, therefore, not 'good lord.'"
12518,12519,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.6.6,GLOUCESTER,"Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer."
12519,12520,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit Lieutenant
12520,12521,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.6.7,KING HENRY VI,"So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf,"
12521,12522,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.6.8,KING HENRY VI,So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
12522,12523,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.6.9,KING HENRY VI,And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
12523,12524,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.6.10,KING HENRY VI,What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
12524,12525,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.6.11,GLOUCESTER,"Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind,"
12525,12526,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.6.12,GLOUCESTER,The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
12526,12527,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.6.13,KING HENRY VI,"The bird that hath been limed in a bush,"
12527,12528,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.6.14,KING HENRY VI,"With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush,"
12528,12529,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.6.15,KING HENRY VI,"And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,"
12529,12530,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.6.16,KING HENRY VI,Have now the fatal object in my eye
12530,12531,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.6.17,KING HENRY VI,"Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd."
12531,12532,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.6.18,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,"
12532,12533,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.6.19,GLOUCESTER,That taught his son the office of a fowl!
12533,12534,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.6.20,GLOUCESTER,"An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd."
12534,12535,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.21,KING HENRY VI,"I, Daedalus, my poor boy, Icarus,"
12535,12536,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.22,KING HENRY VI,"Thy father, Minos, that denied our course,"
12536,12537,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.23,KING HENRY VI,The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
12537,12538,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.24,KING HENRY VI,"Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea"
12538,12539,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.25,KING HENRY VI,Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
12539,12540,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.26,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!"
12540,12541,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.27,KING HENRY VI,My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
12541,12542,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.28,KING HENRY VI,Than can my ears that tragic history.
12542,12543,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.6.29,KING HENRY VI,But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
12543,12544,Henry VI Part 3,9.0,5.6.30,GLOUCESTER,Think'st thou I am an executioner?
12544,12545,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,5.6.31,KING HENRY VI,"A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:"
12545,12546,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,5.6.32,KING HENRY VI,"If murdering innocents be executing,"
12546,12547,Henry VI Part 3,10.0,5.6.33,KING HENRY VI,"Why, then thou art an executioner."
12547,12548,Henry VI Part 3,11.0,5.6.34,GLOUCESTER,Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
12548,12549,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.35,KING HENRY VI,"Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,"
12549,12550,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.36,KING HENRY VI,Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
12550,12551,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.37,KING HENRY VI,"And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,"
12551,12552,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.38,KING HENRY VI,"Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,"
12552,12553,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.39,KING HENRY VI,"And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,"
12553,12554,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.40,KING HENRY VI,And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
12554,12555,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.41,KING HENRY VI,"Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,"
12555,12556,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.42,KING HENRY VI,And orphans for their parents timeless death--
12556,12557,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.43,KING HENRY VI,Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
12557,12558,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.44,KING HENRY VI,"The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign,"
12558,12559,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.45,KING HENRY VI,"The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,"
12559,12560,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.46,KING HENRY VI,"Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees,"
12560,12561,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.47,KING HENRY VI,"The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,"
12561,12562,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.48,KING HENRY VI,And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
12562,12563,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.49,KING HENRY VI,"Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,"
12563,12564,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.50,KING HENRY VI,"And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,"
12564,12565,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.51,KING HENRY VI,"To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,"
12565,12566,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.52,KING HENRY VI,Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
12566,12567,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.53,KING HENRY VI,"Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,"
12567,12568,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.54,KING HENRY VI,To signify thou camest to bite the world:
12568,12569,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.55,KING HENRY VI,"And, if the rest be true which I have heard,"
12569,12570,Henry VI Part 3,12.0,5.6.56,KING HENRY VI,Thou camest--
12570,12571,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.6.57,GLOUCESTER,"I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:"
12571,12572,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,,GLOUCESTER,Stabs him
12572,12573,Henry VI Part 3,13.0,5.6.58,GLOUCESTER,"For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd."
12573,12574,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,5.6.59,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, and for much more slaughter after this."
12574,12575,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,5.6.60,KING HENRY VI,"God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!"
12575,12576,Henry VI Part 3,14.0,,KING HENRY VI,Dies
12576,12577,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.61,GLOUCESTER,"What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster"
12577,12578,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.62,GLOUCESTER,Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
12578,12579,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.63,GLOUCESTER,See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
12579,12580,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.64,GLOUCESTER,"O, may such purple tears be alway shed"
12580,12581,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.65,GLOUCESTER,From those that wish the downfall of our house!
12581,12582,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.66,GLOUCESTER,"If any spark of life be yet remaining,"
12582,12583,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.67,GLOUCESTER,"Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither:"
12583,12584,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,,GLOUCESTER,Stabs him again
12584,12585,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.68,GLOUCESTER,"I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear."
12585,12586,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.69,GLOUCESTER,"Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of,"
12586,12587,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.70,GLOUCESTER,For I have often heard my mother say
12587,12588,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.71,GLOUCESTER,I came into the world with my legs forward:
12588,12589,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.72,GLOUCESTER,"Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,"
12589,12590,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.73,GLOUCESTER,And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
12590,12591,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.74,GLOUCESTER,The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
12591,12592,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.75,GLOUCESTER,"'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'"
12592,12593,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.76,GLOUCESTER,"And so I was, which plainly signified"
12593,12594,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.77,GLOUCESTER,That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
12594,12595,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.78,GLOUCESTER,"Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,"
12595,12596,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.79,GLOUCESTER,Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
12596,12597,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.80,GLOUCESTER,"I have no brother, I am like no brother,"
12597,12598,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.81,GLOUCESTER,"And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,"
12598,12599,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.82,GLOUCESTER,Be resident in men like one another
12599,12600,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.83,GLOUCESTER,And not in me: I am myself alone.
12600,12601,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.84,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, beware, thou keep'st me from the light:"
12601,12602,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.85,GLOUCESTER,"But I will sort a pitchy day for thee,"
12602,12603,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.86,GLOUCESTER,For I will buz abroad such prophecies
12603,12604,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.87,GLOUCESTER,"That Edward shall be fearful of his life,"
12604,12605,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.88,GLOUCESTER,"And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death."
12605,12606,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.89,GLOUCESTER,King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
12606,12607,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.90,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,"
12607,12608,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.91,GLOUCESTER,Counting myself but bad till I be best.
12608,12609,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.92,GLOUCESTER,I'll throw thy body in another room
12609,12610,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,5.6.93,GLOUCESTER,"And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom."
12610,12611,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Exit, with the body"
12611,12612,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE VII. London. The palace.
12612,12613,Henry VI Part 3,15.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH,  CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the young Prince, and Attendants"
12613,12614,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.1,KING EDWARD IV,"Once more we sit in England's royal throne,"
12614,12615,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.2,KING EDWARD IV,Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
12615,12616,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.3,KING EDWARD IV,"What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,"
12616,12617,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.4,KING EDWARD IV,"Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!"
12617,12618,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.5,KING EDWARD IV,"Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd"
12618,12619,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.6,KING EDWARD IV,"For hardy and undoubted champions,"
12619,12620,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.7,KING EDWARD IV,"Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,"
12620,12621,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.8,KING EDWARD IV,"And two Northumberlands, two braver men"
12621,12622,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.9,KING EDWARD IV,"Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound,"
12622,12623,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.10,KING EDWARD IV,"With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,"
12623,12624,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.11,KING EDWARD IV,That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
12624,12625,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.12,KING EDWARD IV,And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
12625,12626,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.13,KING EDWARD IV,Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
12626,12627,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.14,KING EDWARD IV,And made our footstool of security.
12627,12628,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.15,KING EDWARD IV,"Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy."
12628,12629,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.16,KING EDWARD IV,"Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself"
12629,12630,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.17,KING EDWARD IV,"Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,"
12630,12631,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.18,KING EDWARD IV,"Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,"
12631,12632,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.19,KING EDWARD IV,"That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace,"
12632,12633,Henry VI Part 3,1.0,5.7.20,KING EDWARD IV,And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
12633,12634,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.7.21,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid,"
12634,12635,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.7.22,GLOUCESTER,For yet I am not look'd on in the world.
12635,12636,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.7.23,GLOUCESTER,"This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave,"
12636,12637,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.7.24,GLOUCESTER,"And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:"
12637,12638,Henry VI Part 3,2.0,5.7.25,GLOUCESTER,"Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute."
12638,12639,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.7.26,KING EDWARD IV,"Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen,"
12639,12640,Henry VI Part 3,3.0,5.7.27,KING EDWARD IV,"And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both."
12640,12641,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.7.28,CLARENCE,The duty that I owe unto your majesty
12641,12642,Henry VI Part 3,4.0,5.7.29,CLARENCE,I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
12642,12643,Henry VI Part 3,5.0,5.7.30,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thanks, noble Clarence, worthy brother, thanks."
12643,12644,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.7.31,GLOUCESTER,"And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,"
12644,12645,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.7.32,GLOUCESTER,Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
12645,12646,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,,GLOUCESTER,Aside
12646,12647,Henry VI Part 3,6.0,5.7.33,GLOUCESTER,And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.
12647,12648,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.7.34,KING EDWARD IV,"Now am I seated as my soul delights,"
12648,12649,Henry VI Part 3,7.0,5.7.35,KING EDWARD IV,Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
12649,12650,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.7.36,CLARENCE,What will your grace have done with Margaret?
12650,12651,Henry VI Part 3,8.0,5.7.37,CLARENCE,"Reignier, her father, to the king of France"

99192,99193,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,,LUCIUS,PROLOGUE
99193,99194,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.1,LUCIUS,"In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece"
99194,99195,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.2,LUCIUS,"The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,"
99195,99196,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.3,LUCIUS,"Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,"
99196,99197,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.4,LUCIUS,Fraught with the ministers and instruments
99197,99198,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.5,LUCIUS,"Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore"
99198,99199,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.6,LUCIUS,"Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay"
99199,99200,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.7,LUCIUS,"Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made"
99200,99201,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.8,LUCIUS,"To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures"
99201,99202,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.9,LUCIUS,"The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,"
99202,99203,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.10,LUCIUS,"With wanton Paris sleeps, and that's the quarrel."
99203,99204,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.11,LUCIUS,"To Tenedos they come,"
99204,99205,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.12,LUCIUS,And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
99205,99206,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.13,LUCIUS,Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
99206,99207,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.14,LUCIUS,The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
99207,99208,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.15,LUCIUS,"Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,"
99208,99209,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.16,LUCIUS,"Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,"
99209,99210,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.17,LUCIUS,"And Antenorides, with massy staples"
99210,99211,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.18,LUCIUS,"And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,"
99211,99212,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.19,LUCIUS,Sperr up the sons of Troy.
99212,99213,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.20,LUCIUS,"Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,"
99213,99214,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.21,LUCIUS,"On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,"
99214,99215,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.22,LUCIUS,Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
99215,99216,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.23,LUCIUS,"A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence"
99216,99217,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.24,LUCIUS,"Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited"
99217,99218,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.25,LUCIUS,"In like conditions as our argument,"
99218,99219,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.26,LUCIUS,"To tell you, fair beholders, that our play"
99219,99220,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.27,LUCIUS,"Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,"
99220,99221,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.28,LUCIUS,"Beginning in the middle, starting thence away"
99221,99222,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.29,LUCIUS,To what may be digested in a play.
99222,99223,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.30,LUCIUS,"Like or find fault, do as your pleasures are:"
99223,99224,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.31,LUCIUS,"Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war."
99224,99225,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.0.31,LUCIUS,SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
99225,99226,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,,LUCIUS,"Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS"
99226,99227,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.1.1,TROILUS,"Call here my varlet, I'll unarm again:"
99227,99228,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.1.2,TROILUS,"Why should I war without the walls of Troy,"
99228,99229,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.1.3,TROILUS,That find such cruel battle here within?
99229,99230,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.1.4,TROILUS,"Each Trojan that is master of his heart,"
99230,99231,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.1.5,TROILUS,"Let him to field, Troilus, alas! hath none."
99231,99232,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.1.6,PANDARUS,Will this gear ne'er be mended?
99232,99233,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.1.7,TROILUS,"The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,"
99233,99234,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.1.8,TROILUS,"Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant,"
99234,99235,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.1.9,TROILUS,"But I am weaker than a woman's tear,"
99235,99236,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.1.10,TROILUS,"Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,"
99236,99237,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.1.11,TROILUS,Less valiant than the virgin in the night
99237,99238,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.1.12,TROILUS,And skilless as unpractised infancy.
99238,99239,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.1.13,PANDARUS,"Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,"
99239,99240,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.1.14,PANDARUS,I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
99240,99241,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.1.15,PANDARUS,have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
99241,99242,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.1.16,TROILUS,Have I not tarried?
99242,99243,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,1.1.17,PANDARUS,"Ay, the grinding, but you must tarry"
99243,99244,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,1.1.18,PANDARUS,the bolting.
99244,99245,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,1.1.19,TROILUS,Have I not tarried?
99245,99246,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.1.20,PANDARUS,"Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening."
99246,99247,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,1.1.21,TROILUS,Still have I tarried.
99247,99248,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.1.22,PANDARUS,"Ay, to the leavening, but here's yet in the word"
99248,99249,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.1.23,PANDARUS,"'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the"
99249,99250,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.1.24,PANDARUS,"heating of the oven and the baking, nay, you must"
99250,99251,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.1.25,PANDARUS,"stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips."
99251,99252,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,1.1.26,TROILUS,"Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,"
99252,99253,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,1.1.27,TROILUS,Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
99253,99254,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,1.1.28,TROILUS,"At Priam's royal table do I sit,"
99254,99255,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,1.1.29,TROILUS,"And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--"
99255,99256,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,1.1.30,TROILUS,"So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?"
99256,99257,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,1.1.31,PANDARUS,"Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw"
99257,99258,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,1.1.32,PANDARUS,"her look, or any woman else."
99258,99259,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.1.33,TROILUS,"I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,"
99259,99260,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.1.34,TROILUS,"As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,"
99260,99261,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.1.35,TROILUS,"Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,"
99261,99262,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.1.36,TROILUS,"I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,"
99262,99263,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.1.37,TROILUS,Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
99263,99264,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.1.38,TROILUS,"But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,"
99264,99265,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.1.39,TROILUS,Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
99265,99266,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.1.40,PANDARUS,An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
99266,99267,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.1.41,PANDARUS,"well, go to--there were no more comparison between"
99267,99268,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.1.42,PANDARUS,"the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman, I"
99268,99269,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.1.43,PANDARUS,"would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would"
99269,99270,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.1.44,PANDARUS,"somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I"
99270,99271,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.1.45,PANDARUS,"will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--"
99271,99272,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.46,TROILUS,"O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--"
99272,99273,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.47,TROILUS,"When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,"
99273,99274,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.48,TROILUS,Reply not in how many fathoms deep
99274,99275,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.49,TROILUS,They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
99275,99276,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.50,TROILUS,"In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair,'"
99276,99277,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.51,TROILUS,Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
99277,99278,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.52,TROILUS,"Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,"
99278,99279,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.53,TROILUS,"Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,"
99279,99280,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.54,TROILUS,"In whose comparison all whites are ink,"
99280,99281,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.55,TROILUS,"Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure"
99281,99282,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.56,TROILUS,The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
99282,99283,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.57,TROILUS,"Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,"
99283,99284,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.58,TROILUS,"As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her,"
99284,99285,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.59,TROILUS,"But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,"
99285,99286,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.60,TROILUS,Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
99286,99287,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.1.61,TROILUS,The knife that made it.
99287,99288,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,1.1.62,PANDARUS,I speak no more than truth.
99288,99289,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,1.1.63,TROILUS,Thou dost not speak so much.
99289,99290,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,1.1.64,PANDARUS,"Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:"
99290,99291,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,1.1.65,PANDARUS,"if she be fair, 'tis the better for her, an she be"
99291,99292,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,1.1.66,PANDARUS,"not, she has the mends in her own hands."
99292,99293,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,1.1.67,TROILUS,"Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!"
99293,99294,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,1.1.68,PANDARUS,"I have had my labour for my travail, ill-thought on of"
99294,99295,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,1.1.69,PANDARUS,"her and ill-thought on of you, gone between and"
99295,99296,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,1.1.70,PANDARUS,"between, but small thanks for my labour."
99296,99297,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.1.71,TROILUS,"What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?"
99297,99298,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,1.1.72,PANDARUS,"Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair"
99298,99299,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,1.1.73,PANDARUS,"as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as"
99299,99300,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,1.1.74,PANDARUS,fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
99300,99301,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,1.1.75,PANDARUS,"I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor, 'tis all one to me."
99301,99302,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.1.76,TROILUS,Say I she is not fair?
99302,99303,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,1.1.77,PANDARUS,I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
99303,99304,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,1.1.78,PANDARUS,"stay behind her father, let her to the Greeks, and so"
99304,99305,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,1.1.79,PANDARUS,"I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,"
99305,99306,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,1.1.80,PANDARUS,I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
99306,99307,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,1.1.81,TROILUS,"Pandarus,--"
99307,99308,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,1.1.82,PANDARUS,Not I.
99308,99309,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,1.1.83,TROILUS,"Sweet Pandarus,--"
99309,99310,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,1.1.84,PANDARUS,"Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I"
99310,99311,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,1.1.85,PANDARUS,"found it, and there an end."
99311,99312,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,,PANDARUS,Exit PANDARUS. An alarum
99312,99313,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.86,TROILUS,"Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!"
99313,99314,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.87,TROILUS,"Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,"
99314,99315,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.88,TROILUS,When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
99315,99316,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.89,TROILUS,"I cannot fight upon this argument,"
99316,99317,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.90,TROILUS,It is too starved a subject for my sword.
99317,99318,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.91,TROILUS,"But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!"
99318,99319,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.92,TROILUS,"I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,"
99319,99320,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.93,TROILUS,And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
99320,99321,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.94,TROILUS,As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
99321,99322,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.95,TROILUS,"Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,"
99322,99323,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.96,TROILUS,"What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?"
99323,99324,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.97,TROILUS,"Her bed is India, there she lies, a pearl:"
99324,99325,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.98,TROILUS,"Between our Ilium and where she resides,"
99325,99326,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.99,TROILUS,"Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,"
99326,99327,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.100,TROILUS,"Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar"
99327,99328,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.1.101,TROILUS,"Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark."
99328,99329,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,,TROILUS,Alarum. Enter AENEAS
99329,99330,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,1.1.102,AENEAS,"How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?"
99330,99331,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.1.103,TROILUS,"Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,"
99331,99332,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.1.104,TROILUS,For womanish it is to be from thence.
99332,99333,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.1.105,TROILUS,"What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?"
99333,99334,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.1.106,AENEAS,That Paris is returned home and hurt.
99334,99335,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.1.107,TROILUS,"By whom, AEneas?"
99335,99336,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,1.1.108,AENEAS,"Troilus, by Menelaus."
99336,99337,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,1.1.109,TROILUS,"Let Paris bleed, 'tis but a scar to scorn,"
99337,99338,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,1.1.110,TROILUS,Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
99338,99339,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,,TROILUS,Alarum
99339,99340,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.1.111,AENEAS,"Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!"
99340,99341,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,1.1.112,TROILUS,"Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'"
99341,99342,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,1.1.113,TROILUS,But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
99342,99343,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,1.1.114,AENEAS,In all swift haste.
99343,99344,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,1.1.115,TROILUS,"Come, go we then together."
99344,99345,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,,TROILUS,Exeunt
99345,99346,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,,TROILUS,SCENE II. The Same. A street.
99346,99347,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,,TROILUS,Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER
99347,99348,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.2.1,CRESSIDA,Who were those went by?
99348,99349,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.2.2,ALEXANDER,Queen Hecuba and Helen.
99349,99350,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.2.3,CRESSIDA,And whither go they?
99350,99351,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.4,ALEXANDER,"Up to the eastern tower,"
99351,99352,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.5,ALEXANDER,"Whose height commands as subject all the vale,"
99352,99353,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.6,ALEXANDER,"To see the battle. Hector, whose patience"
99353,99354,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.7,ALEXANDER,"Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:"
99354,99355,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.8,ALEXANDER,"He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,"
99355,99356,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.9,ALEXANDER,"And, like as there were husbandry in war,"
99356,99357,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.10,ALEXANDER,"Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,"
99357,99358,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.11,ALEXANDER,"And to the field goes he, where every flower"
99358,99359,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.12,ALEXANDER,"Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw"
99359,99360,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.2.13,ALEXANDER,In Hector's wrath.
99360,99361,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.2.14,CRESSIDA,What was his cause of anger?
99361,99362,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,1.2.15,ALEXANDER,"The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks"
99362,99363,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,1.2.16,ALEXANDER,"A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector,"
99363,99364,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,1.2.17,ALEXANDER,They call him Ajax.
99364,99365,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,1.2.18,CRESSIDA,"Good, and what of him?"
99365,99366,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.2.19,ALEXANDER,"They say he is a very man per se,"
99366,99367,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.2.20,ALEXANDER,And stands alone.
99367,99368,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,1.2.21,CRESSIDA,"So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs."
99368,99369,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.22,ALEXANDER,"This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their"
99369,99370,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.23,ALEXANDER,"particular additions, he is as valiant as the lion,"
99370,99371,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.24,ALEXANDER,"churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man"
99371,99372,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.25,ALEXANDER,into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
99372,99373,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.26,ALEXANDER,"valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with"
99373,99374,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.27,ALEXANDER,discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
99374,99375,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.28,ALEXANDER,"hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he"
99375,99376,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.29,ALEXANDER,carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
99376,99377,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.30,ALEXANDER,"cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the"
99377,99378,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.31,ALEXANDER,"joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint"
99378,99379,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.32,ALEXANDER,"that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,"
99379,99380,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,1.2.33,ALEXANDER,"or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight."
99380,99381,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,1.2.34,CRESSIDA,"But how should this man, that makes"
99381,99382,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,1.2.35,CRESSIDA,"me smile, make Hector angry?"
99382,99383,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,1.2.36,ALEXANDER,They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
99383,99384,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,1.2.37,ALEXANDER,"struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath"
99384,99385,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,1.2.38,ALEXANDER,ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
99385,99386,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.2.39,CRESSIDA,Who comes here?
99386,99387,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.2.40,ALEXANDER,"Madam, your uncle Pandarus."
99387,99388,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,,ALEXANDER,Enter PANDARUS
99388,99389,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.2.41,CRESSIDA,Hector's a gallant man.
99389,99390,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,1.2.42,ALEXANDER,"As may be in the world, lady."
99390,99391,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,1.2.43,PANDARUS,What's that? what's that?
99391,99392,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,1.2.44,CRESSIDA,"Good morrow, uncle Pandarus."
99392,99393,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,1.2.45,PANDARUS,"Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?"
99393,99394,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,1.2.46,PANDARUS,"Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When"
99394,99395,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,1.2.47,PANDARUS,were you at Ilium?
99395,99396,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,1.2.48,CRESSIDA,"This morning, uncle."
99396,99397,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.2.49,PANDARUS,What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
99397,99398,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.2.50,PANDARUS,armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
99398,99399,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.2.51,PANDARUS,"up, was she?"
99399,99400,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,1.2.52,CRESSIDA,"Hector was gone, but Helen was not up."
99400,99401,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.2.53,PANDARUS,Even so: Hector was stirring early.
99401,99402,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,1.2.54,CRESSIDA,"That were we talking of, and of his anger."
99402,99403,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,1.2.55,PANDARUS,Was he angry?
99403,99404,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,1.2.56,CRESSIDA,So he says here.
99404,99405,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,1.2.57,PANDARUS,"True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay"
99405,99406,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,1.2.58,PANDARUS,"about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's"
99406,99407,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,1.2.59,PANDARUS,Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
99407,99408,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,1.2.60,PANDARUS,"heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too."
99408,99409,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,1.2.61,CRESSIDA,"What, is he angry too?"
99409,99410,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.2.62,PANDARUS,"Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two."
99410,99411,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,1.2.63,CRESSIDA,O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
99411,99412,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.2.64,PANDARUS,"What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a"
99412,99413,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.2.65,PANDARUS,man if you see him?
99413,99414,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.2.66,CRESSIDA,"Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him."
99414,99415,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.2.67,PANDARUS,"Well, I say Troilus is Troilus."
99415,99416,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,1.2.68,CRESSIDA,"Then you say as I say, for, I am sure, he is not Hector."
99416,99417,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,1.2.69,PANDARUS,"No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees."
99417,99418,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.2.70,CRESSIDA,"'Tis just to each of them, he is himself."
99418,99419,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,1.2.71,PANDARUS,"Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were."
99419,99420,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,1.2.72,CRESSIDA,So he is.
99420,99421,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,1.2.73,PANDARUS,"Condition, I had gone barefoot to India."
99421,99422,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,1.2.74,CRESSIDA,He is not Hector.
99422,99423,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.2.75,PANDARUS,"Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were"
99423,99424,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.2.76,PANDARUS,"himself! Well, the gods are above, time must friend"
99424,99425,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.2.77,PANDARUS,"or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were"
99425,99426,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.2.78,PANDARUS,"in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus."
99426,99427,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,1.2.79,CRESSIDA,Excuse me.
99427,99428,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.2.80,PANDARUS,He is elder.
99428,99429,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.2.81,CRESSIDA,"Pardon me, pardon me."
99429,99430,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,1.2.82,PANDARUS,"Th' other's not come to't, you shall tell me another"
99430,99431,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,1.2.83,PANDARUS,"tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not"
99431,99432,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,1.2.84,PANDARUS,have his wit this year.
99432,99433,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.2.85,CRESSIDA,"He shall not need it, if he have his own."
99433,99434,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.2.86,PANDARUS,Nor his qualities.
99434,99435,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,1.2.87,CRESSIDA,No matter.
99435,99436,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,1.2.88,PANDARUS,Nor his beauty.
99436,99437,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,1.2.89,CRESSIDA,"'Twould not become him, his own's better."
99437,99438,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,1.2.90,PANDARUS,"You have no judgment, niece: Helen"
99438,99439,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,1.2.91,PANDARUS,"herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for"
99439,99440,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,1.2.92,PANDARUS,"a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--"
99440,99441,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,1.2.93,PANDARUS,"not brown neither,--"
99441,99442,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,1.2.94,CRESSIDA,"No, but brown."
99442,99443,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,1.2.95,PANDARUS,"'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown."
99443,99444,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,1.2.96,CRESSIDA,"To say the truth, true and not true."
99444,99445,Troilus and Cressida,55.0,1.2.97,PANDARUS,She praised his complexion above Paris.
99445,99446,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,1.2.98,CRESSIDA,"Why, Paris hath colour enough."
99446,99447,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,1.2.99,PANDARUS,So he has.
99447,99448,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,1.2.100,CRESSIDA,Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
99448,99449,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,1.2.101,CRESSIDA,"him above, his complexion is higher than his, he"
99449,99450,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,1.2.102,CRESSIDA,"having colour enough, and the other higher, is too"
99450,99451,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,1.2.103,CRESSIDA,flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
99451,99452,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,1.2.104,CRESSIDA,lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
99452,99453,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,1.2.105,CRESSIDA,a copper nose.
99453,99454,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,1.2.106,PANDARUS,I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
99454,99455,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,1.2.107,CRESSIDA,Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
99455,99456,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,1.2.108,PANDARUS,"Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other"
99456,99457,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,1.2.109,PANDARUS,"day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he"
99457,99458,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,1.2.110,PANDARUS,"has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--"
99458,99459,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,1.2.111,CRESSIDA,"Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his"
99459,99460,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,1.2.112,CRESSIDA,particulars therein to a total.
99460,99461,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,1.2.113,PANDARUS,"Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within"
99461,99462,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,1.2.114,PANDARUS,"three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector."
99462,99463,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,1.2.115,CRESSIDA,Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
99463,99464,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,1.2.116,PANDARUS,But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
99464,99465,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,1.2.117,PANDARUS,and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
99465,99466,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,1.2.118,CRESSIDA,Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
99466,99467,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,1.2.119,PANDARUS,"Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling"
99467,99468,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,1.2.120,PANDARUS,becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
99468,99469,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,1.2.121,CRESSIDA,"O, he smiles valiantly."
99469,99470,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,1.2.122,PANDARUS,Does he not?
99470,99471,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,1.2.123,CRESSIDA,"O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn."
99471,99472,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,1.2.124,PANDARUS,"Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen"
99472,99473,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,1.2.125,PANDARUS,"loves Troilus,--"
99473,99474,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,1.2.126,CRESSIDA,"Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll"
99474,99475,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,1.2.127,CRESSIDA,prove it so.
99475,99476,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,1.2.128,PANDARUS,"Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem"
99476,99477,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,1.2.129,PANDARUS,an addle egg.
99477,99478,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,1.2.130,CRESSIDA,If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
99478,99479,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,1.2.131,CRESSIDA,"head, you would eat chickens i' the shell."
99479,99480,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,1.2.132,PANDARUS,"I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled"
99480,99481,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,1.2.133,PANDARUS,"his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I"
99481,99482,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,1.2.134,PANDARUS,"must needs confess,--"
99482,99483,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,1.2.135,CRESSIDA,Without the rack.
99483,99484,Troilus and Cressida,77.0,1.2.136,PANDARUS,And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
99484,99485,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,1.2.137,CRESSIDA,"Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer."
99485,99486,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,1.2.138,PANDARUS,But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
99486,99487,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,1.2.139,PANDARUS,that her eyes ran o'er.
99487,99488,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,1.2.140,CRESSIDA,With mill-stones.
99488,99489,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,1.2.141,PANDARUS,And Cassandra laughed.
99489,99490,Troilus and Cressida,82.0,1.2.142,CRESSIDA,But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
99490,99491,Troilus and Cressida,82.0,1.2.143,CRESSIDA,her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
99491,99492,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,1.2.144,PANDARUS,And Hector laughed.
99492,99493,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,1.2.145,CRESSIDA,At what was all this laughing?
99493,99494,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,1.2.146,PANDARUS,"Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin."
99494,99495,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,1.2.147,CRESSIDA,"An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed"
99495,99496,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,1.2.148,CRESSIDA,too.
99496,99497,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,1.2.149,PANDARUS,They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
99497,99498,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,1.2.150,CRESSIDA,What was his answer?
99498,99499,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,1.2.151,PANDARUS,"Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your"
99499,99500,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,1.2.152,PANDARUS,"chin, and one of them is white."
99500,99501,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,1.2.153,CRESSIDA,This is her question.
99501,99502,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.154,PANDARUS,"That's true, make no question of that. 'Two and"
99502,99503,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.155,PANDARUS,"fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white"
99503,99504,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.156,PANDARUS,"hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'"
99504,99505,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.157,PANDARUS,"'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,"
99505,99506,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.158,PANDARUS,"my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't"
99506,99507,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.159,PANDARUS,"out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!"
99507,99508,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.160,PANDARUS,"and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the"
99508,99509,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,1.2.161,PANDARUS,"rest so laughed, that it passed."
99509,99510,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,1.2.162,CRESSIDA,"So let it now, for it has been while going by."
99510,99511,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,1.2.163,PANDARUS,"Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday, think on't."
99511,99512,Troilus and Cressida,94.0,1.2.164,CRESSIDA,So I do.
99512,99513,Troilus and Cressida,95.0,1.2.165,PANDARUS,"I'll be sworn 'tis true, he will weep you, an 'twere"
99513,99514,Troilus and Cressida,95.0,1.2.166,PANDARUS,a man born in April.
99514,99515,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,1.2.167,CRESSIDA,"And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle"
99515,99516,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,1.2.168,CRESSIDA,against May.
99516,99517,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,,CRESSIDA,A retreat sounded
99517,99518,Troilus and Cressida,97.0,1.2.169,PANDARUS,Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
99518,99519,Troilus and Cressida,97.0,1.2.170,PANDARUS,"stand up here, and see them as they pass toward"
99519,99520,Troilus and Cressida,97.0,1.2.171,PANDARUS,"Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida."
99520,99521,Troilus and Cressida,98.0,1.2.172,CRESSIDA,At your pleasure.
99521,99522,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,1.2.173,PANDARUS,"Here, here, here's an excellent place, here we may"
99522,99523,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,1.2.174,PANDARUS,see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
99523,99524,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,1.2.175,PANDARUS,"names as they pass by, but mark Troilus above the rest."
99524,99525,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,1.2.176,CRESSIDA,Speak not so loud.
99525,99526,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,,CRESSIDA,AENEAS passes
99526,99527,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,1.2.177,PANDARUS,That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of

99531,99532,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,1.2.181,PANDARUS,"That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you,"
99532,99533,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,1.2.182,PANDARUS,"and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest"
99533,99534,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,1.2.183,PANDARUS,"judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person."
99534,99535,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,1.2.184,PANDARUS,When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
99535,99536,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,1.2.185,PANDARUS,"he see me, you shall see him nod at me."
99536,99537,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,1.2.186,CRESSIDA,Will he give you the nod?
99537,99538,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,1.2.187,PANDARUS,You shall see.
99538,99539,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,1.2.188,CRESSIDA,"If he do, the rich shall have more."
99539,99540,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,,CRESSIDA,HECTOR passes

99542,99543,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,1.2.191,PANDARUS,niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
99543,99544,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,1.2.192,PANDARUS,a countenance! is't not a brave man?
99544,99545,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,1.2.193,CRESSIDA,"O, a brave man!"
99545,99546,Troilus and Cressida,109.0,1.2.194,PANDARUS,Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you

99549,99550,Troilus and Cressida,109.0,1.2.198,PANDARUS,there be hacks!
99550,99551,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,1.2.199,CRESSIDA,Be those with swords?

99556,99557,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,1.2.204,PANDARUS,"is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came"

99558,99559,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,1.2.206,PANDARUS,"Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see"
99559,99560,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,1.2.207,PANDARUS,Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
99560,99561,Troilus and Cressida,111.0,,PANDARUS,HELENUS passes

99562,99563,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,1.2.209,PANDARUS,That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
99563,99564,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,1.2.210,PANDARUS,Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
99564,99565,Troilus and Cressida,114.0,1.2.211,CRESSIDA,"Can Helenus fight, uncle?"
99565,99566,Troilus and Cressida,115.0,1.2.212,PANDARUS,"Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I"
99566,99567,Troilus and Cressida,115.0,1.2.213,PANDARUS,marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
99567,99568,Troilus and Cressida,115.0,1.2.214,PANDARUS,people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
99568,99569,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,1.2.215,CRESSIDA,What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
99569,99570,Troilus and Cressida,116.0,,CRESSIDA,TROILUS passes
99570,99571,Troilus and Cressida,117.0,1.2.216,PANDARUS,Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
99571,99572,Troilus and Cressida,117.0,1.2.217,PANDARUS,"there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the"

99576,99577,Troilus and Cressida,119.0,1.2.222,PANDARUS,"his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,"
99577,99578,Troilus and Cressida,119.0,1.2.223,PANDARUS,and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
99578,99579,Troilus and Cressida,119.0,1.2.224,PANDARUS,"three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!"
99579,99580,Troilus and Cressida,119.0,1.2.225,PANDARUS,"Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,"
99580,99581,Troilus and Cressida,119.0,1.2.226,PANDARUS,he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
99581,99582,Troilus and Cressida,119.0,1.2.227,PANDARUS,"Paris is dirt to him, and, I warrant, Helen, to"
99582,99583,Troilus and Cressida,119.0,1.2.228,PANDARUS,"change, would give an eye to boot."
99583,99584,Troilus and Cressida,120.0,1.2.229,CRESSIDA,Here come more.

99586,99587,Troilus and Cressida,121.0,1.2.231,PANDARUS,porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
99587,99588,Troilus and Cressida,121.0,1.2.232,PANDARUS,"eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles"
99588,99589,Troilus and Cressida,121.0,1.2.233,PANDARUS,"are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had"
99589,99590,Troilus and Cressida,121.0,1.2.234,PANDARUS,rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
99590,99591,Troilus and Cressida,121.0,1.2.235,PANDARUS,all Greece.
99591,99592,Troilus and Cressida,122.0,1.2.236,CRESSIDA,"There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus."
99592,99593,Troilus and Cressida,123.0,1.2.237,PANDARUS,"Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel."
99593,99594,Troilus and Cressida,124.0,1.2.238,CRESSIDA,"Well, well."
99594,99595,Troilus and Cressida,125.0,1.2.239,PANDARUS,"'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have"
99595,99596,Troilus and Cressida,125.0,1.2.240,PANDARUS,you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
99596,99597,Troilus and Cressida,125.0,1.2.241,PANDARUS,"birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,"
99597,99598,Troilus and Cressida,125.0,1.2.242,PANDARUS,"learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,"
99598,99599,Troilus and Cressida,125.0,1.2.243,PANDARUS,"and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?"
99599,99600,Troilus and Cressida,126.0,1.2.244,CRESSIDA,"Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date"
99600,99601,Troilus and Cressida,126.0,1.2.245,CRESSIDA,"in the pie, for then the man's date's out."
99601,99602,Troilus and Cressida,127.0,1.2.246,PANDARUS,You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you

99610,99611,Troilus and Cressida,130.0,1.2.255,CRESSIDA,chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would

99612,99613,Troilus and Cressida,130.0,1.2.257,CRESSIDA,"the blow, unless it swell past hiding, and then it's"
99613,99614,Troilus and Cressida,130.0,1.2.258,CRESSIDA,past watching.

99618,99619,Troilus and Cressida,134.0,1.2.262,Boy,"At your own house, there he unarms him."
99619,99620,Troilus and Cressida,135.0,1.2.263,PANDARUS,"Good boy, tell him I come."

99623,99624,Troilus and Cressida,137.0,1.2.266,PANDARUS,"I'll be with you, niece, by and by."
99624,99625,Troilus and Cressida,138.0,1.2.267,CRESSIDA,"To bring, uncle?"
99625,99626,Troilus and Cressida,139.0,1.2.268,PANDARUS,"Ay, a token from Troilus."
99626,99627,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.269,CRESSIDA,"By the same token, you are a bawd."
99627,99628,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,,CRESSIDA,Exit PANDARUS
99628,99629,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.270,CRESSIDA,"Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,"
99629,99630,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.271,CRESSIDA,"He offers in another's enterprise,"
99630,99631,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.272,CRESSIDA,But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
99631,99632,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.273,CRESSIDA,"Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be,"
99632,99633,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.274,CRESSIDA,"Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:"
99633,99634,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.275,CRESSIDA,"Things won are done, joy's soul lies in the doing."
99634,99635,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.276,CRESSIDA,That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
99635,99636,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.277,CRESSIDA,Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
99636,99637,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.278,CRESSIDA,That she was never yet that ever knew
99637,99638,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.279,CRESSIDA,Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
99638,99639,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.280,CRESSIDA,Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
99639,99640,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.281,CRESSIDA,"Achievement is command, ungain'd, beseech:"
99640,99641,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.282,CRESSIDA,"Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,"
99641,99642,Troilus and Cressida,140.0,1.2.283,CRESSIDA,Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.

99646,99647,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.2,AGAMEMNON,What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?

99651,99652,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.7,AGAMEMNON,"As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,"

99655,99656,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.11,AGAMEMNON,That we come short of our suppose so far
99656,99657,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.12,AGAMEMNON,"That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand,"
99657,99658,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.13,AGAMEMNON,"Sith every action that hath gone before,"
99658,99659,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.14,AGAMEMNON,"Whereof we have record, trial did draw"

99660,99661,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.16,AGAMEMNON,And that unbodied figure of the thought
99661,99662,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.17,AGAMEMNON,"That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,"
99662,99663,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.18,AGAMEMNON,"Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,"
99663,99664,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.19,AGAMEMNON,And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
99664,99665,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.20,AGAMEMNON,But the protractive trials of great Jove
99665,99666,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.21,AGAMEMNON,To find persistive constancy in men:
99666,99667,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.22,AGAMEMNON,The fineness of which metal is not found
99667,99668,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.23,AGAMEMNON,"In fortune's love, for then the bold and coward,"
99668,99669,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.24,AGAMEMNON,"The wise and fool, the artist and unread,"
99669,99670,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.25,AGAMEMNON,The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
99670,99671,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.26,AGAMEMNON,"But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,"
99671,99672,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.27,AGAMEMNON,"Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,"
99672,99673,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.28,AGAMEMNON,"Puffing at all, winnows the light away,"
99673,99674,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,1.3.29,AGAMEMNON,"And what hath mass or matter, by itself"

99679,99680,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.35,NESTOR,How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
99680,99681,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.36,NESTOR,"Upon her patient breast, making their way"
99681,99682,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.37,NESTOR,With those of nobler bulk!
99682,99683,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.38,NESTOR,But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
99683,99684,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.39,NESTOR,"The gentle Thetis, and anon behold"
99684,99685,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.40,NESTOR,"The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,"
99685,99686,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.41,NESTOR,"Bounding between the two moist elements,"
99686,99687,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.42,NESTOR,Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
99687,99688,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.43,NESTOR,Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
99688,99689,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.44,NESTOR,"Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,"
99689,99690,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.45,NESTOR,Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
99690,99691,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.46,NESTOR,Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide

99692,99693,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.48,NESTOR,The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
99693,99694,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.49,NESTOR,"Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind"
99694,99695,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.50,NESTOR,"Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,"
99695,99696,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.51,NESTOR,"And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage"
99696,99697,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,1.3.52,NESTOR,"As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,"

99710,99711,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,1.3.64,ULYSSES,As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece

99717,99718,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.3.71,AGAMEMNON,"Speak, prince of Ithaca, and be't of less expect"
99718,99719,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.3.72,AGAMEMNON,"That matter needless, of importless burden,"
99719,99720,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,1.3.73,AGAMEMNON,"Divide thy lips, than we are confident,"

99722,99723,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.76,ULYSSES,"Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,"
99723,99724,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.77,ULYSSES,"And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,"
99724,99725,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.78,ULYSSES,But for these instances.
99725,99726,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.79,ULYSSES,The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
99726,99727,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.80,ULYSSES,"And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand"
99727,99728,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.81,ULYSSES,"Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions."
99728,99729,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.82,ULYSSES,When that the general is not like the hive

99741,99742,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.95,ULYSSES,Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
99742,99743,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.96,ULYSSES,"In evil mixture to disorder wander,"
99743,99744,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.97,ULYSSES,What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
99744,99745,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.98,ULYSSES,What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
99745,99746,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.99,ULYSSES,"Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,"

99749,99750,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.103,ULYSSES,"Which is the ladder to all high designs,"
99750,99751,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.104,ULYSSES,"Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,"

99758,99759,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.112,ULYSSES,In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
99759,99760,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.113,ULYSSES,Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
99760,99761,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.114,ULYSSES,And make a sop of all this solid globe:
99761,99762,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.115,ULYSSES,"Strength should be lord of imbecility,"
99762,99763,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.116,ULYSSES,And the rude son should strike his father dead:

99773,99774,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.127,ULYSSES,Follows the choking.
99774,99775,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.128,ULYSSES,And this neglection of degree it is
99775,99776,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.129,ULYSSES,"That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose"
99776,99777,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.130,ULYSSES,It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd

99783,99784,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.137,ULYSSES,"Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,"
99784,99785,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,1.3.138,ULYSSES,"Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength."
99785,99786,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,1.3.139,NESTOR,Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd

99795,99796,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.3.149,ULYSSES,"Breaks scurril jests,"

99797,99798,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.3.151,ULYSSES,"Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,"
99798,99799,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.3.152,ULYSSES,"He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,"

99800,99801,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.3.154,ULYSSES,"And, like a strutting player, whose conceit"

99802,99803,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,1.3.156,ULYSSES,To hear the wooden dialogue and sound

99861,99862,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,1.3.214,AGAMEMNON,"What trumpet? look, Menelaus."
99862,99863,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,1.3.215,MENELAUS,From Troy.
99863,99864,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,,MENELAUS,Enter AENEAS
99864,99865,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,1.3.216,AGAMEMNON,What would you 'fore our tent?
99865,99866,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,1.3.217,AENEAS,"Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?"
99866,99867,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,1.3.218,AGAMEMNON,Even this.
99867,99868,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,1.3.219,AENEAS,"May one, that is a herald and a prince,"
99868,99869,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,1.3.220,AENEAS,Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
99869,99870,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,1.3.221,AGAMEMNON,With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
99870,99871,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,1.3.222,AGAMEMNON,"'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice"
99871,99872,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,1.3.223,AGAMEMNON,Call Agamemnon head and general.
99872,99873,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,1.3.224,AENEAS,Fair leave and large security. How may
99873,99874,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,1.3.225,AENEAS,A stranger to those most imperial looks
99874,99875,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,1.3.226,AENEAS,Know them from eyes of other mortals?
99875,99876,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,1.3.227,AGAMEMNON,How!
99876,99877,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.3.228,AENEAS,"Ay,"
99877,99878,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.3.229,AENEAS,"I ask, that I might waken reverence,"
99878,99879,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.3.230,AENEAS,And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
99879,99880,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.3.231,AENEAS,Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
99880,99881,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.3.232,AENEAS,The youthful Phoebus:
99881,99882,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.3.233,AENEAS,"Which is that god in office, guiding men?"
99882,99883,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,1.3.234,AENEAS,Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
99883,99884,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,1.3.235,AGAMEMNON,"This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy"
99884,99885,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,1.3.236,AGAMEMNON,Are ceremonious courtiers.
99885,99886,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.237,AENEAS,"Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,"
99886,99887,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.238,AENEAS,"As bending angels, that's their fame in peace:"
99887,99888,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.239,AENEAS,"But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,"
99888,99889,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.240,AENEAS,"Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and,"
99889,99890,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.241,AENEAS,"Jove's accord,"
99890,99891,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.242,AENEAS,"Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,"
99891,99892,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.243,AENEAS,"Peace, Trojan, lay thy finger on thy lips!"
99892,99893,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.244,AENEAS,"The worthiness of praise distains his worth,"
99893,99894,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.245,AENEAS,If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
99894,99895,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.246,AENEAS,"But what the repining enemy commends,"
99895,99896,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.247,AENEAS,"That breath fame blows, that praise, sole sure,"
99896,99897,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,1.3.248,AENEAS,transcends.
99897,99898,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,1.3.249,AGAMEMNON,"Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?"
99898,99899,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,1.3.250,AENEAS,"Ay, Greek, that is my name."
99899,99900,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,1.3.251,AGAMEMNON,What's your affair I pray you?
99900,99901,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,1.3.252,AENEAS,"Sir, pardon, 'tis for Agamemnon's ears."
99901,99902,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,1.3.253,AGAMEMNON,He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
99902,99903,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.3.254,AENEAS,Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
99903,99904,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.3.255,AENEAS,"I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,"
99904,99905,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.3.256,AENEAS,"To set his sense on the attentive bent,"
99905,99906,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,1.3.257,AENEAS,And then to speak.
99906,99907,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,1.3.258,AGAMEMNON,"Speak frankly as the wind,"
99907,99908,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,1.3.259,AGAMEMNON,It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
99908,99909,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,1.3.260,AGAMEMNON,"That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,"
99909,99910,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,1.3.261,AGAMEMNON,He tells thee so himself.
99910,99911,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.262,AENEAS,"Trumpet, blow loud,"
99911,99912,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.263,AENEAS,"Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents,"
99912,99913,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.264,AENEAS,"And every Greek of mettle, let him know,"
99913,99914,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.265,AENEAS,What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
99914,99915,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,,AENEAS,Trumpet sounds
99915,99916,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.266,AENEAS,"We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy"
99916,99917,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.267,AENEAS,"A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--"
99917,99918,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.268,AENEAS,Who in this dull and long-continued truce
99918,99919,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.269,AENEAS,"Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,"
99919,99920,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.270,AENEAS,"And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!"
99920,99921,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.271,AENEAS,If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
99921,99922,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.272,AENEAS,"That holds his honour higher than his ease,"
99922,99923,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.273,AENEAS,"That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,"
99923,99924,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.274,AENEAS,"That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,"
99924,99925,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.275,AENEAS,"That loves his mistress more than in confession,"
99925,99926,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.276,AENEAS,"With truant vows to her own lips he loves,"
99926,99927,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.277,AENEAS,And dare avow her beauty and her worth
99927,99928,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.278,AENEAS,"In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge."
99928,99929,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.279,AENEAS,"Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,"
99929,99930,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.280,AENEAS,"Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,"
99930,99931,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.281,AENEAS,"He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,"
99931,99932,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.282,AENEAS,"Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,"
99932,99933,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.283,AENEAS,And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
99933,99934,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.284,AENEAS,"Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,"
99934,99935,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.285,AENEAS,To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
99935,99936,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.286,AENEAS,"If any come, Hector shall honour him,"
99936,99937,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.287,AENEAS,"If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,"
99937,99938,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.288,AENEAS,The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
99938,99939,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,1.3.289,AENEAS,The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
99939,99940,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.3.290,AGAMEMNON,"This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas,"
99940,99941,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.3.291,AGAMEMNON,"If none of them have soul in such a kind,"
99941,99942,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.3.292,AGAMEMNON,"We left them all at home: but we are soldiers,"
99942,99943,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.3.293,AGAMEMNON,"And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,"
99943,99944,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.3.294,AGAMEMNON,"That means not, hath not, or is not in love!"
99944,99945,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.3.295,AGAMEMNON,"If then one is, or hath, or means to be,"
99945,99946,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,1.3.296,AGAMEMNON,"That one meets Hector, if none else, I am he."
99946,99947,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.297,NESTOR,"Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man"
99947,99948,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.298,NESTOR,"When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now,"
99948,99949,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.299,NESTOR,But if there be not in our Grecian host
99949,99950,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.300,NESTOR,"One noble man that hath one spark of fire,"
99950,99951,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.301,NESTOR,"To answer for his love, tell him from me"
99951,99952,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.302,NESTOR,I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
99952,99953,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.303,NESTOR,"And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,"
99953,99954,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.304,NESTOR,And meeting him will tell him that my lady
99954,99955,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.305,NESTOR,Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
99955,99956,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.306,NESTOR,"As may be in the world: his youth in flood,"
99956,99957,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,1.3.307,NESTOR,I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
99957,99958,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,1.3.308,AENEAS,Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
99958,99959,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,1.3.309,ULYSSES,Amen.
99959,99960,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.3.310,AGAMEMNON,"Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand,"
99960,99961,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.3.311,AGAMEMNON,"To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir."
99961,99962,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.3.312,AGAMEMNON,"Achilles shall have word of this intent,"
99962,99963,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.3.313,AGAMEMNON,"So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:"
99963,99964,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.3.314,AGAMEMNON,Yourself shall feast with us before you go
99964,99965,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,1.3.315,AGAMEMNON,And find the welcome of a noble foe.
99965,99966,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,,AGAMEMNON,Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR
99966,99967,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,1.3.316,ULYSSES,Nestor!
99967,99968,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,1.3.317,NESTOR,What says Ulysses?
99968,99969,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,1.3.318,ULYSSES,"I have a young conception in my brain,"
99969,99970,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,1.3.319,ULYSSES,Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
99970,99971,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,1.3.320,NESTOR,What is't?
99971,99972,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.3.321,ULYSSES,This 'tis:
99972,99973,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.3.322,ULYSSES,Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
99973,99974,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.3.323,ULYSSES,That hath to this maturity blown up
99974,99975,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.3.324,ULYSSES,"In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,"
99975,99976,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.3.325,ULYSSES,"Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,"
99976,99977,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,1.3.326,ULYSSES,To overbulk us all.
99977,99978,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,1.3.327,NESTOR,"Well, and how?"
99978,99979,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.3.328,ULYSSES,"This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,"
99979,99980,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.3.329,ULYSSES,"However it is spread in general name,"
99980,99981,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,1.3.330,ULYSSES,Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
99981,99982,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.331,NESTOR,"The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,"
99982,99983,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.332,NESTOR,Whose grossness little characters sum up:
99983,99984,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.333,NESTOR,"And, in the publication, make no strain,"
99984,99985,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.334,NESTOR,"But that Achilles, were his brain as barren"
99985,99986,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.335,NESTOR,"As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,"
99986,99987,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.336,NESTOR,"'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,"
99987,99988,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.337,NESTOR,"Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose"
99988,99989,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,1.3.338,NESTOR,Pointing on him.
99989,99990,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,1.3.339,ULYSSES,"And wake him to the answer, think you?"
99990,99991,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.340,NESTOR,"Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,"
99991,99992,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.341,NESTOR,"That can from Hector bring his honour off,"
99992,99993,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.342,NESTOR,"If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,"
99993,99994,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.343,NESTOR,"Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,"
99994,99995,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.344,NESTOR,For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
99995,99996,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.345,NESTOR,"With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,"
99996,99997,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.346,NESTOR,Our imputation shall be oddly poised
99997,99998,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.347,NESTOR,"In this wild action, for the success,"
99998,99999,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.348,NESTOR,"Although particular, shall give a scantling"
99999,100000,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.349,NESTOR,"Of good or bad unto the general,"
100000,100001,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.350,NESTOR,"And in such indexes, although small pricks"
100001,100002,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.351,NESTOR,"To their subsequent volumes, there is seen"
100002,100003,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.352,NESTOR,The baby figure of the giant mass
100003,100004,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.353,NESTOR,Of things to come at large. It is supposed
100004,100005,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.354,NESTOR,He that meets Hector issues from our choice
100005,100006,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.355,NESTOR,"And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,"
100006,100007,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.356,NESTOR,"Makes merit her election, and doth boil,"
100007,100008,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.357,NESTOR,"As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd"
100008,100009,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.358,NESTOR,"Out of our virtues, who miscarrying,"
100009,100010,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.359,NESTOR,"What heart receives from hence the conquering part,"
100010,100011,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.360,NESTOR,To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
100011,100012,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.361,NESTOR,"Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,"
100012,100013,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.362,NESTOR,In no less working than are swords and bows
100013,100014,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,1.3.363,NESTOR,Directive by the limbs.
100014,100015,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.364,ULYSSES,Give pardon to my speech:
100015,100016,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.365,ULYSSES,Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
100016,100017,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.366,ULYSSES,"Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,"
100017,100018,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.367,ULYSSES,"And think, perchance, they'll sell, if not,"
100018,100019,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.368,ULYSSES,"The lustre of the better yet to show,"
100019,100020,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.369,ULYSSES,Shall show the better. Do not consent
100020,100021,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.370,ULYSSES,"That ever Hector and Achilles meet,"
100021,100022,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.371,ULYSSES,For both our honour and our shame in this
100022,100023,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,1.3.372,ULYSSES,Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
100023,100024,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,1.3.373,NESTOR,I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
100024,100025,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,1.3.374,ULYSSES,"What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,"
100025,100026,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,1.3.375,ULYSSES,"Were he not proud, we all should share with him:"
100026,100027,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,1.3.376,ULYSSES,"But he already is too insolent,"

100198,100199,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.12,HECTOR,"More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,"
100199,100200,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.13,HECTOR,More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
100200,100201,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.14,HECTOR,"Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,"
100201,100202,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.15,HECTOR,"Surety secure, but modest doubt is call'd"
100202,100203,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.16,HECTOR,"The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches"
100203,100204,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.17,HECTOR,To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
100204,100205,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.18,HECTOR,"Since the first sword was drawn about this question,"
100205,100206,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.19,HECTOR,"Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,"
100206,100207,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.20,HECTOR,"Hath been as dear as Helen, I mean, of ours:"
100207,100208,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.21,HECTOR,"If we have lost so many tenths of ours,"
100208,100209,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.22,HECTOR,"To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,"
100209,100210,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.23,HECTOR,"Had it our name, the value of one ten,"
100210,100211,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.24,HECTOR,What merit's in that reason which denies
100211,100212,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,2.2.25,HECTOR,The yielding of her up?
100212,100213,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.26,TROILUS,"Fie, fie, my brother!"
100213,100214,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.27,TROILUS,Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
100214,100215,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.28,TROILUS,So great as our dread father in a scale
100215,100216,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.29,TROILUS,Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
100216,100217,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.30,TROILUS,The past proportion of his infinite?
100217,100218,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.31,TROILUS,And buckle in a waist most fathomless
100218,100219,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.32,TROILUS,With spans and inches so diminutive
100219,100220,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,2.2.33,TROILUS,"As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!"
100220,100221,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,2.2.34,HELENUS,"No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,"
100221,100222,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,2.2.35,HELENUS,You are so empty of them. Should not our father
100222,100223,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,2.2.36,HELENUS,"Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,"
100223,100224,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,2.2.37,HELENUS,Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
100224,100225,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.38,TROILUS,"You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest,"
100225,100226,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.39,TROILUS,You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
100226,100227,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.40,TROILUS,your reasons:
100227,100228,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.41,TROILUS,"You know an enemy intends you harm,"
100228,100229,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.42,TROILUS,"You know a sword employ'd is perilous,"
100229,100230,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.43,TROILUS,And reason flies the object of all harm:
100230,100231,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.44,TROILUS,"Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds"
100231,100232,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.45,TROILUS,"A Grecian and his sword, if he do set"
100232,100233,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.46,TROILUS,The very wings of reason to his heels
100233,100234,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.47,TROILUS,"And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,"
100234,100235,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.48,TROILUS,"Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,"
100235,100236,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.49,TROILUS,Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
100236,100237,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.50,TROILUS,"Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat"
100237,100238,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.51,TROILUS,their thoughts
100238,100239,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.52,TROILUS,With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
100239,100240,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,2.2.53,TROILUS,Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
100240,100241,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,2.2.54,HECTOR,"Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost"
100241,100242,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,2.2.55,HECTOR,The holding.
100242,100243,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,2.2.56,TROILUS,"What is aught, but as 'tis valued?"
100243,100244,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.57,HECTOR,"But value dwells not in particular will,"
100244,100245,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.58,HECTOR,It holds his estimate and dignity
100245,100246,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.59,HECTOR,As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
100246,100247,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.60,HECTOR,As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
100247,100248,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.61,HECTOR,To make the service greater than the god
100248,100249,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.62,HECTOR,And the will dotes that is attributive
100249,100250,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.63,HECTOR,"To what infectiously itself affects,"
100250,100251,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,2.2.64,HECTOR,Without some image of the affected merit.
100251,100252,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.65,TROILUS,"I take to-day a wife, and my election"
100252,100253,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.66,TROILUS,"Is led on in the conduct of my will,"
100253,100254,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.67,TROILUS,"My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,"
100254,100255,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.68,TROILUS,Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
100255,100256,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.69,TROILUS,"Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,"
100256,100257,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.70,TROILUS,"Although my will distaste what it elected,"
100257,100258,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.71,TROILUS,The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
100258,100259,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.72,TROILUS,To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
100259,100260,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.73,TROILUS,"We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,"
100260,100261,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.74,TROILUS,"When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands"
100261,100262,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.75,TROILUS,"We do not throw in unrespective sieve,"
100262,100263,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.76,TROILUS,Because we now are full. It was thought meet
100263,100264,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.77,TROILUS,Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
100264,100265,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.78,TROILUS,"Your breath of full consent bellied his sails,"
100265,100266,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.79,TROILUS,"The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce"
100266,100267,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.80,TROILUS,"And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,"
100267,100268,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.81,TROILUS,"And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,"
100268,100269,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.82,TROILUS,"He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness"
100269,100270,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.83,TROILUS,"Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning."
100270,100271,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.84,TROILUS,Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
100271,100272,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.85,TROILUS,"Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,"
100272,100273,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.86,TROILUS,"Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,"
100273,100274,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.87,TROILUS,And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
100274,100275,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.88,TROILUS,If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
100275,100276,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.89,TROILUS,"As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--"
100276,100277,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.90,TROILUS,If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
100277,100278,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.91,TROILUS,"As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands"
100278,100279,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.92,TROILUS,And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
100279,100280,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.93,TROILUS,"The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,"
100280,100281,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.94,TROILUS,"And do a deed that fortune never did,"
100281,100282,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.95,TROILUS,Beggar the estimation which you prized
100282,100283,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.96,TROILUS,"Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,"
100283,100284,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.97,TROILUS,That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
100284,100285,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.98,TROILUS,"But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,"
100285,100286,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.99,TROILUS,"That in their country did them that disgrace,"
100286,100287,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,2.2.100,TROILUS,We fear to warrant in our native place!
100287,100288,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,2.2.101,CASSANDRA,"[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!"
100288,100289,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,2.2.102,PRIAM,What noise? what shriek is this?
100289,100290,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,2.2.103,TROILUS,"'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice."
100290,100291,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,2.2.104,CASSANDRA,"[Within]  Cry, Trojans!"
100291,100292,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,2.2.105,HECTOR,It is Cassandra.
100292,100293,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,,HECTOR,"Enter CASSANDRA, raving"
100293,100294,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,2.2.106,CASSANDRA,"Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,"
100294,100295,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,2.2.107,CASSANDRA,And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
100295,100296,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,2.2.108,HECTOR,"Peace, sister, peace!"
100296,100297,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.109,CASSANDRA,"Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,"
100297,100298,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.110,CASSANDRA,"Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,"
100298,100299,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.111,CASSANDRA,Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
100299,100300,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.112,CASSANDRA,A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
100300,100301,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.113,CASSANDRA,"Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!"
100301,100302,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.114,CASSANDRA,"Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand,"
100302,100303,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.115,CASSANDRA,"Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all."
100303,100304,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,2.2.116,CASSANDRA,"Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:"

100307,100308,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.119,HECTOR,Of divination in our sister work
100308,100309,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.120,HECTOR,Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
100309,100310,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.121,HECTOR,"So madly hot that no discourse of reason,"
100310,100311,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.122,HECTOR,"Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,"
100311,100312,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,2.2.123,HECTOR,Can qualify the same?
100312,100313,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.124,TROILUS,"Why, brother Hector,"
100313,100314,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.125,TROILUS,We may not think the justness of each act
100314,100315,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.126,TROILUS,"Such and no other than event doth form it,"
100315,100316,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.127,TROILUS,"Nor once deject the courage of our minds,"
100316,100317,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.128,TROILUS,Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
100317,100318,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.129,TROILUS,Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
100318,100319,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.130,TROILUS,Which hath our several honours all engaged
100319,100320,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.131,TROILUS,"To make it gracious. For my private part,"
100320,100321,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.132,TROILUS,I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
100321,100322,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.133,TROILUS,And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
100322,100323,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.134,TROILUS,Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
100323,100324,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,2.2.135,TROILUS,To fight for and maintain!
100324,100325,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.136,PARIS,Else might the world convince of levity
100325,100326,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.137,PARIS,As well my undertakings as your counsels:
100326,100327,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.138,PARIS,"But I attest the gods, your full consent"
100327,100328,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.139,PARIS,Gave wings to my propension and cut off
100328,100329,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.140,PARIS,All fears attending on so dire a project.
100329,100330,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.141,PARIS,"For what, alas, can these my single arms?"
100330,100331,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.142,PARIS,"What Propugnation is in one man's valour,"
100331,100332,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.143,PARIS,To stand the push and enmity of those
100332,100333,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.144,PARIS,"This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,"
100333,100334,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.145,PARIS,Were I alone to pass the difficulties
100334,100335,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.146,PARIS,"And had as ample power as I have will,"
100335,100336,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.147,PARIS,"Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,"
100336,100337,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,2.2.148,PARIS,Nor faint in the pursuit.
100337,100338,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.149,PRIAM,"Paris, you speak"
100338,100339,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.150,PRIAM,Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
100339,100340,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.151,PRIAM,"You have the honey still, but these the gall,"
100340,100341,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,2.2.152,PRIAM,So to be valiant is no praise at all.
100341,100342,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.153,PARIS,"Sir, I propose not merely to myself"
100342,100343,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.154,PARIS,"The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,"
100343,100344,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.155,PARIS,But I would have the soil of her fair rape
100344,100345,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.156,PARIS,"Wiped off, in honourable keeping her."
100345,100346,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.157,PARIS,"What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,"
100346,100347,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.158,PARIS,"Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,"
100347,100348,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.159,PARIS,Now to deliver her possession up
100348,100349,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.160,PARIS,On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
100349,100350,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.161,PARIS,That so degenerate a strain as this
100350,100351,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.162,PARIS,Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
100351,100352,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.163,PARIS,There's not the meanest spirit on our party
100352,100353,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.164,PARIS,Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
100353,100354,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.165,PARIS,"When Helen is defended, nor none so noble"
100354,100355,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.166,PARIS,Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
100355,100356,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.167,PARIS,"Where Helen is the subject, then, I say,"
100356,100357,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.168,PARIS,"Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,"
100357,100358,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,2.2.169,PARIS,The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
100358,100359,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.170,HECTOR,"Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,"
100359,100360,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,2.2.171,HECTOR,And on the cause and question now in hand

100531,100532,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.111,AGAMEMNON,Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
100532,100533,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.112,AGAMEMNON,"Much attribute he hath, and much the reason"
100533,100534,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.113,AGAMEMNON,"Why we ascribe it to him, yet all his virtues,"
100534,100535,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.114,AGAMEMNON,"Not virtuously on his own part beheld,"
100535,100536,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.115,AGAMEMNON,"Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,"
100536,100537,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.116,AGAMEMNON,"Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,"
100537,100538,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.117,AGAMEMNON,"Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,"
100538,100539,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.118,AGAMEMNON,"We come to speak with him, and you shall not sin,"
100539,100540,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.119,AGAMEMNON,If you do say we think him over-proud
100540,100541,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.120,AGAMEMNON,"And under-honest, in self-assumption greater"
100541,100542,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.121,AGAMEMNON,"Than in the note of judgment, and worthier"
100542,100543,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.122,AGAMEMNON,than himself
100543,100544,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.123,AGAMEMNON,"Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,"
100544,100545,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.124,AGAMEMNON,"Disguise the holy strength of their command,"
100545,100546,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.125,AGAMEMNON,And underwrite in an observing kind
100546,100547,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.126,AGAMEMNON,"His humorous predominance, yea, watch"
100547,100548,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.127,AGAMEMNON,"His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if"
100548,100549,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.128,AGAMEMNON,The passage and whole carriage of this action
100549,100550,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.129,AGAMEMNON,"Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,"
100550,100551,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.130,AGAMEMNON,"That if he overhold his price so much,"
100551,100552,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.131,AGAMEMNON,"We'll none of him, but let him, like an engine"
100552,100553,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.132,AGAMEMNON,"Not portable, lie under this report:"
100553,100554,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.133,AGAMEMNON,"'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:"
100554,100555,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.134,AGAMEMNON,A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
100555,100556,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,2.3.135,AGAMEMNON,Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
100556,100557,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,2.3.136,PATROCLUS,"I shall, and bring his answer presently."
100557,100558,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,,PATROCLUS,Exit
100558,100559,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,2.3.137,AGAMEMNON,"In second voice we'll not be satisfied,"
100559,100560,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,2.3.138,AGAMEMNON,"We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you."
100560,100561,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,,AGAMEMNON,Exit ULYSSES
100561,100562,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,2.3.139,AJAX,What is he more than another?
100562,100563,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,2.3.140,AGAMEMNON,No more than what he thinks he is.
100563,100564,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,2.3.141,AJAX,Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
100564,100565,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,2.3.142,AJAX,better man than I am?
100565,100566,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,2.3.143,AGAMEMNON,No question.
100566,100567,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,2.3.144,AJAX,"Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?"
100567,100568,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,2.3.145,AGAMEMNON,"No, noble Ajax, you are as strong, as valiant, as"
100568,100569,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,2.3.146,AGAMEMNON,"wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether"
100569,100570,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,2.3.147,AGAMEMNON,more tractable.
100570,100571,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,2.3.148,AJAX,Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
100571,100572,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,2.3.149,AJAX,know not what pride is.
100572,100573,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.150,AGAMEMNON,"Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the"
100573,100574,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.151,AGAMEMNON,fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
100574,100575,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.152,AGAMEMNON,"his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle,"
100575,100576,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.153,AGAMEMNON,"and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours"
100576,100577,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,2.3.154,AGAMEMNON,the deed in the praise.
100577,100578,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,2.3.155,AJAX,"I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads."
100578,100579,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,2.3.156,NESTOR,Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
100579,100580,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,,NESTOR,Aside
100580,100581,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,,NESTOR,Re-enter ULYSSES
100581,100582,Troilus and Cressida,55.0,2.3.157,ULYSSES,Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
100582,100583,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,2.3.158,AGAMEMNON,What's his excuse?
100583,100584,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.159,ULYSSES,"He doth rely on none,"
100584,100585,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.160,ULYSSES,But carries on the stream of his dispose
100585,100586,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.161,ULYSSES,"Without observance or respect of any,"
100586,100587,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,2.3.162,ULYSSES,In will peculiar and in self-admission.
100587,100588,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,2.3.163,AGAMEMNON,Why will he not upon our fair request
100588,100589,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,2.3.164,AGAMEMNON,Untent his person and share the air with us?
100589,100590,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.165,ULYSSES,"Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,"
100590,100591,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.166,ULYSSES,"He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,"
100591,100592,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.167,ULYSSES,And speaks not to himself but with a pride
100592,100593,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.168,ULYSSES,That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
100593,100594,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.169,ULYSSES,Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
100594,100595,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.170,ULYSSES,That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
100595,100596,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.171,ULYSSES,Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
100596,100597,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.172,ULYSSES,And batters down himself: what should I say?
100597,100598,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.173,ULYSSES,He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
100598,100599,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,2.3.174,ULYSSES,Cry 'No recovery.'
100599,100600,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.175,AGAMEMNON,Let Ajax go to him.
100600,100601,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.176,AGAMEMNON,"Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:"
100601,100602,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.177,AGAMEMNON,"'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led"
100602,100603,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,2.3.178,AGAMEMNON,At your request a little from himself.
100603,100604,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.179,ULYSSES,"O Agamemnon, let it not be so!"
100604,100605,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.180,ULYSSES,We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
100605,100606,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.181,ULYSSES,When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
100606,100607,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.182,ULYSSES,That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
100607,100608,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.183,ULYSSES,And never suffers matter of the world
100608,100609,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.184,ULYSSES,"Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve"
100609,100610,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.185,ULYSSES,"And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd"
100610,100611,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.186,ULYSSES,Of that we hold an idol more than he?
100611,100612,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.187,ULYSSES,"No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord"
100612,100613,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.188,ULYSSES,"Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,"
100613,100614,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.189,ULYSSES,"Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,"
100614,100615,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.190,ULYSSES,"As amply titled as Achilles is,"
100615,100616,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.191,ULYSSES,By going to Achilles:
100616,100617,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.192,ULYSSES,That were to enlard his fat already pride
100617,100618,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.193,ULYSSES,And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
100618,100619,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.194,ULYSSES,With entertaining great Hyperion.
100619,100620,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.195,ULYSSES,"This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,"
100620,100621,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,2.3.196,ULYSSES,And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
100621,100622,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,2.3.197,NESTOR,"[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well, he rubs the"
100622,100623,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,2.3.198,NESTOR,vein of him.
100623,100624,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,2.3.199,DIOMEDES,[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up
100624,100625,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,2.3.200,DIOMEDES,this applause!
100625,100626,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,2.3.201,AJAX,"If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face."
100626,100627,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,2.3.202,AGAMEMNON,"O, no, you shall not go."
100627,100628,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,2.3.203,AJAX,"An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:"
100628,100629,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,2.3.204,AJAX,Let me go to him.
100629,100630,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,2.3.205,ULYSSES,Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
100630,100631,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,2.3.206,AJAX,"A paltry, insolent fellow!"
100631,100632,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,2.3.207,NESTOR,How he describes himself!
100632,100633,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,2.3.208,AJAX,Can he not be sociable?
100633,100634,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,2.3.209,ULYSSES,The raven chides blackness.
100634,100635,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,2.3.210,AJAX,I'll let his humours blood.
100635,100636,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,2.3.211,AGAMEMNON,He will be the physician that should be the patient.
100636,100637,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,2.3.212,AJAX,"An all men were o' my mind,--"
100637,100638,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,2.3.213,ULYSSES,Wit would be out of fashion.
100638,100639,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,2.3.214,AJAX,"A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:"
100639,100640,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,2.3.215,AJAX,shall pride carry it?
100640,100641,Troilus and Cressida,77.0,2.3.216,NESTOR,"An 'twould, you'ld carry half."
100641,100642,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,2.3.217,ULYSSES,A' would have ten shares.
100642,100643,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,2.3.218,AJAX,"I will knead him, I'll make him supple."
100643,100644,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,2.3.219,NESTOR,He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
100644,100645,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,2.3.220,NESTOR,"pour in, pour in, his ambition is dry."
100645,100646,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,2.3.221,ULYSSES,"[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike."
100646,100647,Troilus and Cressida,82.0,2.3.222,NESTOR,"Our noble general, do not do so."
100647,100648,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,2.3.223,DIOMEDES,You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
100648,100649,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,2.3.224,ULYSSES,"Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm."
100649,100650,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,2.3.225,ULYSSES,"Here is a man--but 'tis before his face,"
100650,100651,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,2.3.226,ULYSSES,I will be silent.
100651,100652,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,2.3.227,NESTOR,Wherefore should you so?
100652,100653,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,2.3.228,NESTOR,"He is not emulous, as Achilles is."
100653,100654,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,2.3.229,ULYSSES,"Know the whole world, he is as valiant."
100654,100655,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,2.3.230,AJAX,"A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!"
100655,100656,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,2.3.231,AJAX,Would he were a Trojan!
100656,100657,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,2.3.232,NESTOR,"What a vice were it in Ajax now,--"
100657,100658,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,2.3.233,ULYSSES,"If he were proud,--"
100658,100659,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,2.3.234,DIOMEDES,"Or covetous of praise,--"

100859,100860,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.8,TROILUS,"No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,"
100860,100861,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.9,TROILUS,Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
100861,100862,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.10,TROILUS,"Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,"
100862,100863,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.11,TROILUS,And give me swift transportance to those fields
100863,100864,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.12,TROILUS,Where I may wallow in the lily-beds

100865,100866,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.14,TROILUS,From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
100866,100867,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.2.15,TROILUS,And fly with me to Cressid!

100870,100871,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.18,TROILUS,The imaginary relish is so sweet
100871,100872,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.19,TROILUS,"That it enchants my sense: what will it be,"
100872,100873,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.20,TROILUS,When that the watery palate tastes indeed
100873,100874,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.21,TROILUS,"Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,"
100874,100875,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.2.22,TROILUS,"Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,"

100883,100884,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.30,PANDARUS,"must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches"

100885,100886,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.32,PANDARUS,sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
100886,100887,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.33,PANDARUS,villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
100887,100888,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.2.34,PANDARUS,new-ta'en sparrow.
100888,100889,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,,PANDARUS,Exit

100891,100892,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.37,TROILUS,"And all my powers do their bestowing lose,"
100892,100893,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.38,TROILUS,Like vassalage at unawares encountering
100893,100894,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.2.39,TROILUS,The eye of majesty.
100894,100895,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,,TROILUS,Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA

100918,100919,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,3.2.62,CRESSIDA,"Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!"
100919,100920,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,3.2.63,TROILUS,What should they grant? what makes this pretty
100920,100921,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,3.2.64,TROILUS,abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet

100922,100923,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,3.2.66,CRESSIDA,"More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes."
100923,100924,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,3.2.67,TROILUS,"Fears make devils of cherubims, they never see truly."

100925,100926,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,3.2.69,CRESSIDA,footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to

100929,100930,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,3.2.73,CRESSIDA,Nor nothing monstrous neither?

100932,100933,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.76,TROILUS,it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
100933,100934,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.77,TROILUS,enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.

100936,100937,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.2.80,TROILUS,desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.

100948,100949,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.92,TROILUS,shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
100949,100950,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.93,TROILUS,shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
100950,100951,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.2.94,TROILUS,"shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can"

100955,100956,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.2.98,CRESSIDA,"Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you."
100956,100957,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.2.99,PANDARUS,"I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,"
100957,100958,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.2.100,PANDARUS,you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
100958,100959,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.2.101,PANDARUS,"flinch, chide me for it."

100961,100962,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.104,PANDARUS,"Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,"
100962,100963,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.105,PANDARUS,"though they be long ere they are wooed, they are"
100963,100964,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.106,PANDARUS,"constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you,"
100964,100965,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.2.107,PANDARUS,they'll stick where they are thrown.
100965,100966,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.2.108,CRESSIDA,"Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart."

100968,100969,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.2.111,TROILUS,Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
100969,100970,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.112,CRESSIDA,"Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,"
100970,100971,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.113,CRESSIDA,With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
100971,100972,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.114,CRESSIDA,"If I confess much, you will play the tyrant."

100974,100975,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.117,CRESSIDA,"My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown"

100976,100977,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.119,CRESSIDA,"Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,"
100977,100978,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.120,CRESSIDA,When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
100978,100979,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.121,CRESSIDA,"But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not,"
100979,100980,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.122,CRESSIDA,"And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,"
100980,100981,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.123,CRESSIDA,Or that we women had men's privilege
100981,100982,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.124,CRESSIDA,"Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,"
100982,100983,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.125,CRESSIDA,For in this rapture I shall surely speak
100983,100984,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.126,CRESSIDA,"The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,"
100984,100985,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.127,CRESSIDA,"Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws"
100985,100986,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.2.128,CRESSIDA,My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.

100989,100990,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.2.132,CRESSIDA,"'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:"
100990,100991,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.2.133,CRESSIDA,I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
100991,100992,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.2.134,CRESSIDA,"For this time will I take my leave, my lord."
100992,100993,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,3.2.135,TROILUS,"Your leave, sweet Cressid!"
100993,100994,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,3.2.136,PANDARUS,"Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--"

100996,100997,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,3.2.139,CRESSIDA,"Sir, mine own company."
100997,100998,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,3.2.140,TROILUS,You cannot shun Yourself.
100998,100999,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.141,CRESSIDA,Let me go and try:

101000,101001,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.143,CRESSIDA,"But an unkind self, that itself will leave,"
101001,101002,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.2.144,CRESSIDA,To be another's fool. I would be gone:

101003,101004,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,3.2.146,TROILUS,Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
101004,101005,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.147,CRESSIDA,"Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love,"
101005,101006,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.148,CRESSIDA,"And fell so roundly to a large confession,"
101006,101007,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.149,CRESSIDA,"To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,"
101007,101008,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.2.150,CRESSIDA,"Or else you love not, for to be wise and love"

101009,101010,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.152,TROILUS,O that I thought it could be in a woman--
101010,101011,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.153,TROILUS,"As, if it can, I will presume in you--"

101016,101017,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.159,TROILUS,That my integrity and truth to you
101017,101018,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.160,TROILUS,Might be affronted with the match and weight
101018,101019,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.161,TROILUS,"Of such a winnow'd purity in love,"
101019,101020,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.162,TROILUS,"How were I then uplifted! but, alas!"
101020,101021,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.163,TROILUS,I am as true as truth's simplicity
101021,101022,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.2.164,TROILUS,And simpler than the infancy of truth.
101022,101023,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.2.165,CRESSIDA,In that I'll war with you.
101023,101024,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.166,TROILUS,"O virtuous fight,"
101024,101025,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.167,TROILUS,When right with right wars who shall be most right!
101025,101026,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.168,TROILUS,True swains in love shall in the world to come
101026,101027,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.169,TROILUS,"Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,"
101027,101028,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.170,TROILUS,"Full of protest, of oath and big compare,"
101028,101029,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.171,TROILUS,"Want similes, truth tired with iteration,"
101029,101030,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.172,TROILUS,"As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,"
101030,101031,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.173,TROILUS,"As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,"
101031,101032,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.174,TROILUS,"As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,"
101032,101033,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.175,TROILUS,"Yet, after all comparisons of truth,"
101033,101034,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.176,TROILUS,"As truth's authentic author to be cited,"
101034,101035,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.177,TROILUS,"'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,"
101035,101036,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.2.178,TROILUS,And sanctify the numbers.
101036,101037,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.179,CRESSIDA,Prophet may you be!
101037,101038,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.180,CRESSIDA,"If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,"
101038,101039,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.181,CRESSIDA,"When time is old and hath forgot itself,"
101039,101040,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.182,CRESSIDA,"When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,"
101040,101041,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.183,CRESSIDA,"And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,"
101041,101042,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.184,CRESSIDA,And mighty states characterless are grated
101042,101043,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.185,CRESSIDA,"To dusty nothing, yet let memory,"
101043,101044,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.186,CRESSIDA,"From false to false, among false maids in love,"
101044,101045,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.187,CRESSIDA,Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
101045,101046,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.188,CRESSIDA,"As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,"
101046,101047,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.189,CRESSIDA,"As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,"

101048,101049,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.191,CRESSIDA,"'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,"
101049,101050,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,3.2.192,CRESSIDA,'As false as Cressid.'
101050,101051,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.2.193,PANDARUS,"Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it, I'll be the"
101051,101052,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.2.194,PANDARUS,"witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's."
101052,101053,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.2.195,PANDARUS,"If ever you prove false one to another, since I have"
101053,101054,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.2.196,PANDARUS,"taken such pains to bring you together, let all"
101054,101055,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.2.197,PANDARUS,pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end

101056,101057,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.2.199,PANDARUS,"constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,"
101057,101058,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,3.2.200,PANDARUS,"and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen."
101058,101059,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,3.2.201,TROILUS,Amen.
101059,101060,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,3.2.202,CRESSIDA,Amen.
101060,101061,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,3.2.203,PANDARUS,Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
101061,101062,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,3.2.204,PANDARUS,"bed, which bed, because it shall not speak of your"
101062,101063,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,3.2.205,PANDARUS,"pretty encounters, press it to death: away!"
101063,101064,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,3.2.206,PANDARUS,And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here

101068,101069,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.1,CALCHAS,"Now, princes, for the service I have done you,"
101069,101070,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.2,CALCHAS,The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
101070,101071,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.3,CALCHAS,To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
101071,101072,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.4,CALCHAS,"That, through the sight I bear in things to love,"
101072,101073,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.5,CALCHAS,"I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,"
101073,101074,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.6,CALCHAS,"Incurr'd a traitor's name, exposed myself,"
101074,101075,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.7,CALCHAS,"From certain and possess'd conveniences,"
101075,101076,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.8,CALCHAS,"To doubtful fortunes, sequestering from me all"
101076,101077,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.9,CALCHAS,"That time, acquaintance, custom and condition"
101077,101078,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.10,CALCHAS,"Made tame and most familiar to my nature,"
101078,101079,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.11,CALCHAS,"And here, to do you service, am become"
101079,101080,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.12,CALCHAS,"As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:"
101080,101081,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.13,CALCHAS,"I do beseech you, as in way of taste,"
101081,101082,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.14,CALCHAS,"To give me now a little benefit,"
101082,101083,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.15,CALCHAS,"Out of those many register'd in promise,"
101083,101084,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,3.3.16,CALCHAS,"Which, you say, live to come in my behalf."
101084,101085,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,3.3.17,AGAMEMNON,"What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand."
101085,101086,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.18,CALCHAS,"You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,"
101086,101087,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.19,CALCHAS,Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
101087,101088,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.20,CALCHAS,Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
101088,101089,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.21,CALCHAS,"Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,"
101089,101090,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.22,CALCHAS,"Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,"
101090,101091,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.23,CALCHAS,"I know, is such a wrest in their affairs"
101091,101092,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.24,CALCHAS,"That their negotiations all must slack,"
101092,101093,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.25,CALCHAS,"Wanting his manage, and they will almost"
101093,101094,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.26,CALCHAS,"Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,"
101094,101095,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.27,CALCHAS,"In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,"
101095,101096,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.28,CALCHAS,"And he shall buy my daughter, and her presence"
101096,101097,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.29,CALCHAS,"Shall quite strike off all service I have done,"
101097,101098,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,3.3.30,CALCHAS,In most accepted pain.
101098,101099,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.31,AGAMEMNON,"Let Diomedes bear him,"
101099,101100,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.32,AGAMEMNON,And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
101100,101101,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.33,AGAMEMNON,"What he requests of us. Good Diomed,"
101101,101102,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.34,AGAMEMNON,Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
101102,101103,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.35,AGAMEMNON,Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
101103,101104,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,3.3.36,AGAMEMNON,Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
101104,101105,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,3.3.37,DIOMEDES,"This shall I undertake, and 'tis a burden"
101105,101106,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,3.3.38,DIOMEDES,Which I am proud to bear.
101106,101107,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,DIOMEDES,Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
101107,101108,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,DIOMEDES,"Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent"
101108,101109,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.39,ULYSSES,Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
101109,101110,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.40,ULYSSES,"Please it our general to pass strangely by him,"
101110,101111,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.41,ULYSSES,"As if he were forgot, and, princes all,"
101111,101112,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.42,ULYSSES,Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
101112,101113,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.43,ULYSSES,I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
101113,101114,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.44,ULYSSES,Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
101114,101115,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.45,ULYSSES,"If so, I have derision medicinable,"
101115,101116,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.46,ULYSSES,"To use between your strangeness and his pride,"
101116,101117,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.47,ULYSSES,Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
101117,101118,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.48,ULYSSES,It may be good: pride hath no other glass
101118,101119,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.49,ULYSSES,"To show itself but pride, for supple knees"
101119,101120,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,3.3.50,ULYSSES,Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
101120,101121,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.51,AGAMEMNON,"We'll execute your purpose, and put on"
101121,101122,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.52,AGAMEMNON,A form of strangeness as we pass along:
101122,101123,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.53,AGAMEMNON,"So do each lord, and either greet him not,"
101123,101124,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.54,AGAMEMNON,"Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more"
101124,101125,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,3.3.55,AGAMEMNON,Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
101125,101126,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.3.56,ACHILLES,"What, comes the general to speak with me?"
101126,101127,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,3.3.57,ACHILLES,"You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy."
101127,101128,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,3.3.58,AGAMEMNON,What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
101128,101129,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,3.3.59,NESTOR,"Would you, my lord, aught with the general?"
101129,101130,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,3.3.60,ACHILLES,No.
101130,101131,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,3.3.61,NESTOR,"Nothing, my lord."
101131,101132,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,3.3.62,AGAMEMNON,The better.
101132,101133,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,,AGAMEMNON,Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
101133,101134,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,3.3.63,ACHILLES,"Good day, good day."

101135,101136,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,,MENELAUS,Exit
101136,101137,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,3.3.65,ACHILLES,"What, does the cuckold scorn me?"
101137,101138,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,3.3.66,AJAX,"How now, Patroclus!"
101138,101139,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,3.3.67,ACHILLES,"Good morrow, Ajax."
101139,101140,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,3.3.68,AJAX,Ha?
101140,101141,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,3.3.69,ACHILLES,Good morrow.
101141,101142,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,3.3.70,AJAX,"Ay, and good next day too."
101142,101143,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,,AJAX,Exit
101143,101144,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,3.3.71,ACHILLES,What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
101144,101145,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.72,PATROCLUS,They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
101145,101146,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.73,PATROCLUS,"To send their smiles before them to Achilles,"
101146,101147,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.74,PATROCLUS,To come as humbly as they used to creep
101147,101148,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,3.3.75,PATROCLUS,To holy altars.
101148,101149,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.76,ACHILLES,"What, am I poor of late?"
101149,101150,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.77,ACHILLES,"'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,"
101150,101151,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.78,ACHILLES,Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
101151,101152,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.79,ACHILLES,He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
101152,101153,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.80,ACHILLES,"As feel in his own fall, for men, like butterflies,"
101153,101154,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.81,ACHILLES,"Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,"
101154,101155,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.82,ACHILLES,"And not a man, for being simply man,"
101155,101156,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.83,ACHILLES,"Hath any honour, but honour for those honours"
101156,101157,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.84,ACHILLES,"That are without him, as place, riches, favour,"
101157,101158,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.85,ACHILLES,Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
101158,101159,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.86,ACHILLES,"Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,"
101159,101160,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.87,ACHILLES,"The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,"
101160,101161,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.88,ACHILLES,Do one pluck down another and together
101161,101162,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.89,ACHILLES,Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
101162,101163,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.90,ACHILLES,Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
101163,101164,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.91,ACHILLES,"At ample point all that I did possess,"
101164,101165,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.92,ACHILLES,"Save these men's looks, who do, methinks, find out"
101165,101166,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.93,ACHILLES,Something not worth in me such rich beholding
101166,101167,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.94,ACHILLES,"As they have often given. Here is Ulysses,"
101167,101168,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.95,ACHILLES,I'll interrupt his reading.
101168,101169,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,3.3.96,ACHILLES,How now Ulysses!
101169,101170,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,3.3.97,ULYSSES,"Now, great Thetis' son!"
101170,101171,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,3.3.98,ACHILLES,What are you reading?
101171,101172,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.99,ULYSSES,A strange fellow here
101172,101173,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.100,ULYSSES,"Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,"
101173,101174,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.101,ULYSSES,"How much in having, or without or in,"
101174,101175,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.102,ULYSSES,"Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,"
101175,101176,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.103,ULYSSES,"Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection,"
101176,101177,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.104,ULYSSES,As when his virtues shining upon others
101177,101178,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.105,ULYSSES,Heat them and they retort that heat again
101178,101179,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,3.3.106,ULYSSES,To the first giver.'
101179,101180,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.107,ACHILLES,"This is not strange, Ulysses."
101180,101181,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.108,ACHILLES,The beauty that is borne here in the face
101181,101182,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.109,ACHILLES,"The bearer knows not, but commends itself"
101182,101183,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.110,ACHILLES,"To others' eyes, nor doth the eye itself,"
101183,101184,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.111,ACHILLES,"That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,"
101184,101185,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.112,ACHILLES,"Not going from itself, but eye to eye opposed"
101185,101186,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.113,ACHILLES,"Salutes each other with each other's form,"
101186,101187,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.114,ACHILLES,"For speculation turns not to itself,"
101187,101188,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.115,ACHILLES,Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
101188,101189,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,3.3.116,ACHILLES,Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
101189,101190,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.117,ULYSSES,"I do not strain at the position,--"
101190,101191,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.118,ULYSSES,"It is familiar,--but at the author's drift,"
101191,101192,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.119,ULYSSES,"Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves"
101192,101193,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.120,ULYSSES,"That no man is the lord of any thing,"
101193,101194,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.121,ULYSSES,"Though in and of him there be much consisting,"
101194,101195,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.122,ULYSSES,Till he communicate his parts to others:
101195,101196,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.123,ULYSSES,Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
101196,101197,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.124,ULYSSES,Till he behold them form'd in the applause
101197,101198,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.125,ULYSSES,"Where they're extended, who, like an arch,"
101198,101199,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.126,ULYSSES,reverberates
101199,101200,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.127,ULYSSES,"The voice again, or, like a gate of steel"
101200,101201,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.128,ULYSSES,"Fronting the sun, receives and renders back"
101201,101202,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.129,ULYSSES,"His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this,"
101202,101203,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.130,ULYSSES,And apprehended here immediately
101203,101204,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.131,ULYSSES,The unknown Ajax.
101204,101205,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.132,ULYSSES,"Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,"
101205,101206,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.133,ULYSSES,"That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are"
101206,101207,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.134,ULYSSES,Most abject in regard and dear in use!
101207,101208,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.135,ULYSSES,What things again most dear in the esteem
101208,101209,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.136,ULYSSES,And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
101209,101210,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.137,ULYSSES,An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
101210,101211,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.138,ULYSSES,"Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,"
101211,101212,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.139,ULYSSES,While some men leave to do!
101212,101213,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.140,ULYSSES,"How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,"
101213,101214,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.141,ULYSSES,Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
101214,101215,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.142,ULYSSES,"How one man eats into another's pride,"
101215,101216,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.143,ULYSSES,While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
101216,101217,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.144,ULYSSES,"To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already"
101217,101218,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.145,ULYSSES,"They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,"
101218,101219,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.146,ULYSSES,As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
101219,101220,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,3.3.147,ULYSSES,And great Troy shrieking.
101220,101221,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.3.148,ACHILLES,"I do believe it, for they pass'd by me"
101221,101222,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.3.149,ACHILLES,"As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me"
101222,101223,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,3.3.150,ACHILLES,"Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?"
101223,101224,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.151,ULYSSES,"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,"
101224,101225,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.152,ULYSSES,"Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,"
101225,101226,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.153,ULYSSES,A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
101226,101227,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.154,ULYSSES,"Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd"
101227,101228,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.155,ULYSSES,"As fast as they are made, forgot as soon"
101228,101229,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.156,ULYSSES,"As done: perseverance, dear my lord,"
101229,101230,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.157,ULYSSES,Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
101230,101231,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.158,ULYSSES,"Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail"
101231,101232,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.159,ULYSSES,"In monumental mockery. Take the instant way,"
101232,101233,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.160,ULYSSES,"For honour travels in a strait so narrow,"
101233,101234,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.161,ULYSSES,"Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path,"
101234,101235,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.162,ULYSSES,For emulation hath a thousand sons
101235,101236,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.163,ULYSSES,"That one by one pursue: if you give way,"
101236,101237,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.164,ULYSSES,"Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,"
101237,101238,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.165,ULYSSES,"Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by"
101238,101239,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.166,ULYSSES,"And leave you hindmost,"
101239,101240,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.167,ULYSSES,"Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,"
101240,101241,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.168,ULYSSES,"Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,"
101241,101242,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.169,ULYSSES,"O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,"
101242,101243,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.170,ULYSSES,"Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours,"
101243,101244,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.171,ULYSSES,For time is like a fashionable host
101244,101245,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.172,ULYSSES,"That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,"
101245,101246,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.173,ULYSSES,"And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,"
101246,101247,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.174,ULYSSES,"Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,"
101247,101248,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.175,ULYSSES,"And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not"
101248,101249,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.176,ULYSSES,virtue seek
101249,101250,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.177,ULYSSES,"Remuneration for the thing it was,"
101250,101251,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.178,ULYSSES,"For beauty, wit,"
101251,101252,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.179,ULYSSES,"High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,"
101252,101253,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.180,ULYSSES,"Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all"
101253,101254,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.181,ULYSSES,To envious and calumniating time.
101254,101255,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.182,ULYSSES,"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,"
101255,101256,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.183,ULYSSES,"That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,"
101256,101257,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.184,ULYSSES,"Though they are made and moulded of things past,"
101257,101258,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.185,ULYSSES,And give to dust that is a little gilt
101258,101259,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.186,ULYSSES,More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
101259,101260,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.187,ULYSSES,The present eye praises the present object.
101260,101261,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.188,ULYSSES,"Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,"
101261,101262,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.189,ULYSSES,"That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax,"
101262,101263,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.190,ULYSSES,Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
101263,101264,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.191,ULYSSES,"Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,"
101264,101265,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.192,ULYSSES,"And still it might, and yet it may again,"
101265,101266,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.193,ULYSSES,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
101266,101267,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.194,ULYSSES,"And case thy reputation in thy tent,"
101267,101268,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.195,ULYSSES,"Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,"
101268,101269,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.196,ULYSSES,Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
101269,101270,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,3.3.197,ULYSSES,And drave great Mars to faction.
101270,101271,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.3.198,ACHILLES,Of this my privacy
101271,101272,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,3.3.199,ACHILLES,I have strong reasons.
101272,101273,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.200,ULYSSES,But 'gainst your privacy
101273,101274,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.201,ULYSSES,The reasons are more potent and heroical:
101274,101275,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.202,ULYSSES,"'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love"
101275,101276,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,3.3.203,ULYSSES,With one of Priam's daughters.
101276,101277,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,3.3.204,ACHILLES,Ha! known!
101277,101278,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.205,ULYSSES,Is that a wonder?
101278,101279,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.206,ULYSSES,The providence that's in a watchful state
101279,101280,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.207,ULYSSES,"Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,"
101280,101281,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.208,ULYSSES,"Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,"
101281,101282,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.209,ULYSSES,"Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,"
101282,101283,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.210,ULYSSES,Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
101283,101284,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.211,ULYSSES,There is a mystery--with whom relation
101284,101285,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.212,ULYSSES,"Durst never meddle--in the soul of state,"
101285,101286,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.213,ULYSSES,Which hath an operation more divine
101286,101287,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.214,ULYSSES,Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
101287,101288,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.215,ULYSSES,All the commerce that you have had with Troy
101288,101289,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.216,ULYSSES,"As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord,"
101289,101290,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.217,ULYSSES,And better would it fit Achilles much
101290,101291,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.218,ULYSSES,To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
101291,101292,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.219,ULYSSES,"But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,"
101292,101293,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.220,ULYSSES,"When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,"
101293,101294,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.221,ULYSSES,"And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,"
101294,101295,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.222,ULYSSES,"'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,"
101295,101296,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.223,ULYSSES,But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
101296,101297,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.224,ULYSSES,"Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak,"
101297,101298,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,3.3.225,ULYSSES,The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
101298,101299,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,,ULYSSES,Exit
101299,101300,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.226,PATROCLUS,"To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:"
101300,101301,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.227,PATROCLUS,A woman impudent and mannish grown
101301,101302,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.228,PATROCLUS,Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
101302,101303,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.229,PATROCLUS,"In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this,"
101303,101304,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.230,PATROCLUS,They think my little stomach to the war
101304,101305,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.231,PATROCLUS,And your great love to me restrains you thus:
101305,101306,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.232,PATROCLUS,"Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid"
101306,101307,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.233,PATROCLUS,"Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,"
101307,101308,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.234,PATROCLUS,"And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,"
101308,101309,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,3.3.235,PATROCLUS,Be shook to air.
101309,101310,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,3.3.236,ACHILLES,Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
101310,101311,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,3.3.237,PATROCLUS,"Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him."
101311,101312,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,3.3.238,ACHILLES,I see my reputation is at stake
101312,101313,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,3.3.239,ACHILLES,My fame is shrewdly gored.
101313,101314,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.240,PATROCLUS,"O, then, beware,"
101314,101315,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.241,PATROCLUS,Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
101315,101316,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.242,PATROCLUS,Omission to do what is necessary
101316,101317,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.243,PATROCLUS,"Seals a commission to a blank of danger,"
101317,101318,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.244,PATROCLUS,"And danger, like an ague, subtly taints"
101318,101319,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,3.3.245,PATROCLUS,Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
101319,101320,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.246,ACHILLES,"Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:"
101320,101321,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.247,ACHILLES,I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
101321,101322,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.248,ACHILLES,To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
101322,101323,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.249,ACHILLES,"To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,"
101323,101324,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.250,ACHILLES,"An appetite that I am sick withal,"
101324,101325,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.251,ACHILLES,"To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,"
101325,101326,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.252,ACHILLES,"To talk with him and to behold his visage,"
101326,101327,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.253,ACHILLES,Even to my full of view.
101327,101328,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,,ACHILLES,Enter THERSITES
101328,101329,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,3.3.254,ACHILLES,A labour saved!
101329,101330,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,3.3.255,THERSITES,A wonder!
101330,101331,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,3.3.256,ACHILLES,What?
101331,101332,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,3.3.257,THERSITES,"Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself."
101332,101333,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,3.3.258,ACHILLES,How so?
101333,101334,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.3.259,THERSITES,"He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so"
101334,101335,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.3.260,THERSITES,prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
101335,101336,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,3.3.261,THERSITES,raves in saying nothing.
101336,101337,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,3.3.262,ACHILLES,How can that be?
101337,101338,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.263,THERSITES,"Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride"
101338,101339,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.264,THERSITES,and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
101339,101340,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.265,THERSITES,arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
101340,101341,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.266,THERSITES,"bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should"

101344,101345,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.270,THERSITES,"The man's undone forever, for if Hector break not his"

101347,101348,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.273,THERSITES,"Ajax,' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think"
101348,101349,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.274,THERSITES,you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
101349,101350,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.275,THERSITES,"grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster."
101350,101351,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.276,THERSITES,A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
101351,101352,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,3.3.277,THERSITES,"sides, like a leather jerkin."
101352,101353,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,3.3.278,ACHILLES,"Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites."

101384,101385,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,3.3.310,THERSITES,"No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in"

101392,101393,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,3.3.318,ACHILLES,And I myself see not the bottom of it.

101395,101396,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,3.3.320,THERSITES,that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a

101401,101402,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,4.1.1,PARIS,"See, ho! who is that there?"
101402,101403,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.1.2,DEIPHOBUS,It is the Lord AEneas.
101403,101404,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.3,AENEAS,Is the prince there in person?
101404,101405,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.4,AENEAS,Had I so good occasion to lie long
101405,101406,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.5,AENEAS,"As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business"
101406,101407,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.1.6,AENEAS,Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
101407,101408,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,4.1.7,DIOMEDES,"That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas."
101408,101409,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.8,PARIS,"A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--"
101409,101410,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.9,PARIS,"Witness the process of your speech, wherein"
101410,101411,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.10,PARIS,"You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,"
101411,101412,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.1.11,PARIS,Did haunt you in the field.
101412,101413,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.1.12,AENEAS,"Health to you, valiant sir,"
101413,101414,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.1.13,AENEAS,"During all question of the gentle truce,"
101414,101415,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.1.14,AENEAS,"But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance"
101415,101416,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.1.15,AENEAS,As heart can think or courage execute.
101416,101417,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.1.16,DIOMEDES,The one and other Diomed embraces.
101417,101418,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.1.17,DIOMEDES,"Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health!"
101418,101419,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.1.18,DIOMEDES,"But when contention and occasion meet,"
101419,101420,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.1.19,DIOMEDES,"By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life"
101420,101421,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.1.20,DIOMEDES,"With all my force, pursuit and policy."
101421,101422,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.1.21,AENEAS,"And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly"
101422,101423,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.1.22,AENEAS,"With his face backward. In humane gentleness,"
101423,101424,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.1.23,AENEAS,"Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,"
101424,101425,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.1.24,AENEAS,"Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,"
101425,101426,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.1.25,AENEAS,No man alive can love in such a sort
101426,101427,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.1.26,AENEAS,The thing he means to kill more excellently.
101427,101428,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.1.27,DIOMEDES,"We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,"
101428,101429,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.1.28,DIOMEDES,"If to my sword his fate be not the glory,"
101429,101430,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.1.29,DIOMEDES,A thousand complete courses of the sun!
101430,101431,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.1.30,DIOMEDES,"But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,"
101431,101432,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.1.31,DIOMEDES,"With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!"
101432,101433,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,4.1.32,AENEAS,We know each other well.
101433,101434,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,4.1.33,DIOMEDES,"We do, and long to know each other worse."
101434,101435,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.1.34,PARIS,"This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,"
101435,101436,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.1.35,PARIS,"The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of."
101436,101437,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.1.36,PARIS,"What business, lord, so early?"
101437,101438,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,4.1.37,AENEAS,"I was sent for to the king, but why, I know not."
101438,101439,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.38,PARIS,His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
101439,101440,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.39,PARIS,"To Calchas' house, and there to render him,"
101440,101441,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.40,PARIS,"For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:"
101441,101442,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.41,PARIS,"Let's have your company, or, if you please,"
101442,101443,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.42,PARIS,Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
101443,101444,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.43,PARIS,"Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--"
101444,101445,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.44,PARIS,My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
101445,101446,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.45,PARIS,Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
101446,101447,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.46,PARIS,With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
101447,101448,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.1.47,PARIS,We shall be much unwelcome.
101448,101449,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.1.48,AENEAS,That I assure you:
101449,101450,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.1.49,AENEAS,Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
101450,101451,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.1.50,AENEAS,Than Cressid borne from Troy.
101451,101452,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.1.51,PARIS,"There is no help,"
101452,101453,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.1.52,PARIS,The bitter disposition of the time
101453,101454,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.1.53,PARIS,"Will have it so. On, lord, we'll follow you."
101454,101455,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.1.54,AENEAS,"Good morrow, all."
101455,101456,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,,AENEAS,Exit with Servant
101456,101457,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.55,PARIS,"And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,"
101457,101458,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.56,PARIS,"Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,"
101458,101459,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.57,PARIS,"Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,"
101459,101460,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.1.58,PARIS,Myself or Menelaus?
101460,101461,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.59,DIOMEDES,Both alike:
101461,101462,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.60,DIOMEDES,"He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,"
101462,101463,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.61,DIOMEDES,"Not making any scruple of her soilure,"
101463,101464,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.62,DIOMEDES,"With such a hell of pain and world of charge,"
101464,101465,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.63,DIOMEDES,"And you as well to keep her, that defend her,"
101465,101466,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.64,DIOMEDES,"Not palating the taste of her dishonour,"
101466,101467,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.65,DIOMEDES,With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
101467,101468,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.66,DIOMEDES,"He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up"
101468,101469,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.67,DIOMEDES,"The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece,"
101469,101470,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.68,DIOMEDES,"You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins"
101470,101471,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.69,DIOMEDES,Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
101471,101472,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.70,DIOMEDES,"Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more,"
101472,101473,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.1.71,DIOMEDES,"But he as he, the heavier for a whore."
101473,101474,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,4.1.72,PARIS,You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
101474,101475,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.73,DIOMEDES,"She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:"
101475,101476,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.74,DIOMEDES,For every false drop in her bawdy veins
101476,101477,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.75,DIOMEDES,"A Grecian's life hath sunk, for every scruple"
101477,101478,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.76,DIOMEDES,"Of her contaminated carrion weight,"
101478,101479,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.77,DIOMEDES,"A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,"
101479,101480,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.78,DIOMEDES,She hath not given so many good words breath
101480,101481,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.1.79,DIOMEDES,As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
101481,101482,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.80,PARIS,"Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,"
101482,101483,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.81,PARIS,Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
101483,101484,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.82,PARIS,"But we in silence hold this virtue well,"
101484,101485,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.83,PARIS,We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
101485,101486,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.1.84,PARIS,Here lies our way.
101486,101487,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,,PARIS,Exeunt

101490,101491,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.2.2,CRESSIDA,"Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down,"
101491,101492,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.2.3,CRESSIDA,He shall unbolt the gates.
101492,101493,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.2.4,TROILUS,"Trouble him not,"
101493,101494,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.2.5,TROILUS,"To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,"
101494,101495,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.2.6,TROILUS,And give as soft attachment to thy senses
101495,101496,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,4.2.7,TROILUS,As infants' empty of all thought!
101496,101497,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,4.2.8,CRESSIDA,"Good morrow, then."
101497,101498,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.2.9,TROILUS,"I prithee now, to bed."
101498,101499,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.2.10,CRESSIDA,Are you a-weary of me?
101499,101500,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.2.11,TROILUS,"O Cressida! but that the busy day,"
101500,101501,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.2.12,TROILUS,"Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,"
101501,101502,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.2.13,TROILUS,"And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,"
101502,101503,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.2.14,TROILUS,I would not from thee.
101503,101504,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.2.15,CRESSIDA,Night hath been too brief.
101504,101505,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.2.16,TROILUS,Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
101505,101506,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.2.17,TROILUS,"As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love"
101506,101507,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.2.18,TROILUS,With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
101507,101508,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.2.19,TROILUS,"You will catch cold, and curse me."

101511,101512,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,4.2.23,CRESSIDA,And then you would have tarried. Hark!

101634,101635,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.4,CRESSIDA,And violenteth in a sense as strong
101635,101636,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.5,CRESSIDA,As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
101636,101637,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.6,CRESSIDA,"If I could temporize with my affection,"
101637,101638,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.7,CRESSIDA,"Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,"

101639,101640,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.9,CRESSIDA,"My love admits no qualifying dross,"
101640,101641,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.4.10,CRESSIDA,"No more my grief, in such a precious loss."

101653,101654,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.4.21,PANDARUS,There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
101654,101655,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.4.22,PANDARUS,"nothing, for we may live to have need of such a"
101655,101656,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,4.4.23,PANDARUS,"verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?"
101656,101657,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.4.24,TROILUS,"Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,"

101663,101664,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,4.4.31,TROILUS,A hateful truth.
101664,101665,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,4.4.32,CRESSIDA,"What, and from Troilus too?"
101665,101666,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.4.33,TROILUS,From Troy and Troilus.

101672,101673,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.40,TROILUS,Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:

101674,101675,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.42,TROILUS,"Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves"
101675,101676,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.43,TROILUS,With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
101676,101677,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.44,TROILUS,Injurious time now with a robber's haste
101677,101678,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.45,TROILUS,"Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:"
101678,101679,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.46,TROILUS,"As many farewells as be stars in heaven,"
101679,101680,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.47,TROILUS,"With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,"
101680,101681,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.48,TROILUS,"He fumbles up into a lose adieu,"
101681,101682,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.49,TROILUS,"And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,"
101682,101683,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.4.50,TROILUS,Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
101683,101684,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.4.51,AENEAS,"[Within]  My lord, is the lady ready?"
101684,101685,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.4.52,TROILUS,Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
101685,101686,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.4.53,TROILUS,Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
101686,101687,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.4.54,TROILUS,"Bid them have patience, she shall come anon."
101687,101688,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.4.55,PANDARUS,"Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or"
101688,101689,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.4.56,PANDARUS,my heart will be blown up by the root.
101689,101690,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,,PANDARUS,Exit
101690,101691,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.4.57,CRESSIDA,I must then to the Grecians?
101691,101692,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.4.58,TROILUS,No remedy.
101692,101693,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,4.4.59,CRESSIDA,A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
101693,101694,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,4.4.60,CRESSIDA,When shall we see again?
101694,101695,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.4.61,TROILUS,"Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--"
101695,101696,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.4.62,CRESSIDA,I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
101696,101697,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.63,TROILUS,"Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,"
101697,101698,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.64,TROILUS,For it is parting from us:
101698,101699,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.65,TROILUS,"I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,"
101699,101700,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.66,TROILUS,"For I will throw my glove to Death himself,"
101700,101701,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.67,TROILUS,That there's no maculation in thy heart:
101701,101702,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.68,TROILUS,"But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in"
101702,101703,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.69,TROILUS,"My sequent protestation, be thou true,"
101703,101704,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.4.70,TROILUS,And I will see thee.
101704,101705,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,4.4.71,CRESSIDA,"O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers"
101705,101706,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,4.4.72,CRESSIDA,As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
101706,101707,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,4.4.73,TROILUS,And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
101707,101708,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,4.4.74,CRESSIDA,And you this glove. When shall I see you?
101708,101709,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.4.75,TROILUS,"I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,"
101709,101710,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.4.76,TROILUS,To give thee nightly visitation.
101710,101711,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.4.77,TROILUS,But yet be true.
101711,101712,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,4.4.78,CRESSIDA,O heavens! 'be true' again!
101712,101713,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.79,TROILUS,"Hear while I speak it, love:"
101713,101714,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.80,TROILUS,"The Grecian youths are full of quality,"
101714,101715,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.81,TROILUS,"They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,"
101715,101716,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.82,TROILUS,Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
101716,101717,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.83,TROILUS,"How novelty may move, and parts with person,"
101717,101718,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.84,TROILUS,"Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--"
101718,101719,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.85,TROILUS,"Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--"
101719,101720,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.4.86,TROILUS,Makes me afeard.
101720,101721,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,4.4.87,CRESSIDA,O heavens! you love me not.
101721,101722,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.88,TROILUS,"Die I a villain, then!"
101722,101723,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.89,TROILUS,In this I do not call your faith in question
101723,101724,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.90,TROILUS,"So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,"
101724,101725,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.91,TROILUS,"Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,"
101725,101726,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.92,TROILUS,"Nor play at subtle games, fair virtues all,"
101726,101727,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.93,TROILUS,To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
101727,101728,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.94,TROILUS,But I can tell that in each grace of these
101728,101729,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.95,TROILUS,There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
101729,101730,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.4.96,TROILUS,That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
101730,101731,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,4.4.97,CRESSIDA,Do you think I will?
101731,101732,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.98,TROILUS,No.
101732,101733,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.99,TROILUS,But something may be done that we will not:
101733,101734,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.100,TROILUS,"And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,"
101734,101735,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.101,TROILUS,"When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,"
101735,101736,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.4.102,TROILUS,Presuming on their changeful potency.
101736,101737,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,4.4.103,AENEAS,"[Within]  Nay, good my lord,--"
101737,101738,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,4.4.104,TROILUS,"Come, kiss, and let us part."
101738,101739,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,4.4.105,PARIS,[Within]  Brother Troilus!
101739,101740,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,4.4.106,TROILUS,"Good brother, come you hither,"
101740,101741,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,4.4.107,TROILUS,And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
101741,101742,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,4.4.108,CRESSIDA,"My lord, will you be true?"
101742,101743,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.109,TROILUS,"Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:"
101743,101744,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.110,TROILUS,"Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,"
101744,101745,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.111,TROILUS,"I with great truth catch mere simplicity,"
101745,101746,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.112,TROILUS,"Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,"
101746,101747,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.113,TROILUS,With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
101747,101748,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.114,TROILUS,Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
101748,101749,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.115,TROILUS,"Is 'plain and true,' there's all the reach of it."
101749,101750,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,,TROILUS,"Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDES"
101750,101751,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.116,TROILUS,"Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady"
101751,101752,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.117,TROILUS,Which for Antenor we deliver you:
101752,101753,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.118,TROILUS,"At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,"
101753,101754,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.119,TROILUS,And by the way possess thee what she is.
101754,101755,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.120,TROILUS,"Entreat her fair, and, by my soul, fair Greek,"
101755,101756,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.121,TROILUS,"If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,"
101756,101757,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.122,TROILUS,Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
101757,101758,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.4.123,TROILUS,As Priam is in Ilion.
101758,101759,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.4.124,DIOMEDES,"Fair Lady Cressid,"
101759,101760,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.4.125,DIOMEDES,"So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:"
101760,101761,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.4.126,DIOMEDES,"The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,"
101761,101762,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.4.127,DIOMEDES,"Pleads your fair usage, and to Diomed"
101762,101763,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.4.128,DIOMEDES,"You shall be mistress, and command him wholly."
101763,101764,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.129,TROILUS,"Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,"
101764,101765,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.130,TROILUS,To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
101765,101766,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.131,TROILUS,"In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,"
101766,101767,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.132,TROILUS,She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
101767,101768,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.133,TROILUS,As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
101768,101769,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.134,TROILUS,"I charge thee use her well, even for my charge,"
101769,101770,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.135,TROILUS,"For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,"
101770,101771,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.136,TROILUS,"Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,"
101771,101772,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.4.137,TROILUS,I'll cut thy throat.
101772,101773,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.138,DIOMEDES,"O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:"
101773,101774,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.139,DIOMEDES,"Let me be privileged by my place and message,"
101774,101775,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.140,DIOMEDES,"To be a speaker free, when I am hence"
101775,101776,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.141,DIOMEDES,"I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,"
101776,101777,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.142,DIOMEDES,I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
101777,101778,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.143,DIOMEDES,"She shall be prized, but that you say 'be't so,'"
101778,101779,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.4.144,DIOMEDES,"I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'"
101779,101780,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.145,TROILUS,"Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,"
101780,101781,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.146,TROILUS,This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
101781,101782,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.147,TROILUS,"Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,"
101782,101783,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.4.148,TROILUS,To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
101783,101784,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,,TROILUS,"Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDES"
101784,101785,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,,TROILUS,Trumpet within
101785,101786,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,4.4.149,PARIS,Hark! Hector's trumpet.
101786,101787,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.4.150,AENEAS,How have we spent this morning!
101787,101788,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.4.151,AENEAS,"The prince must think me tardy and remiss,"
101788,101789,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.4.152,AENEAS,That sore to ride before him to the field.
101789,101790,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,4.4.153,PARIS,"'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him."
101790,101791,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,4.4.154,DEIPHOBUS,Let us make ready straight.
101791,101792,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.4.155,AENEAS,"Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,"
101792,101793,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.4.156,AENEAS,Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
101793,101794,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.4.157,AENEAS,The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
101794,101795,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.4.158,AENEAS,On his fair worth and single chivalry.
101795,101796,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,,AENEAS,Exeunt

101799,101800,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,4.5.2,AGAMEMNON,Anticipating time with starting courage.
101800,101801,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,4.5.3,AGAMEMNON,"Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,"
101801,101802,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,4.5.4,AGAMEMNON,"Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air"
101802,101803,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,4.5.5,AGAMEMNON,May pierce the head of the great combatant
101803,101804,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,4.5.6,AGAMEMNON,And hale him hither.
101804,101805,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.5.7,AJAX,"Thou, trumpet, there's my purse."
101805,101806,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.5.8,AJAX,"Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:"
101806,101807,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,4.5.9,AJAX,"Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek"

101814,101815,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.5.16,ULYSSES,"'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait,"
101815,101816,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.5.17,ULYSSES,He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
101816,101817,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,4.5.18,ULYSSES,In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
101817,101818,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,,ULYSSES,"Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA"
101818,101819,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,4.5.19,AGAMEMNON,Is this the Lady Cressid?
101819,101820,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,4.5.20,DIOMEDES,Even she.
101820,101821,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,4.5.21,AGAMEMNON,"Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady."
101821,101822,Troilus and Cressida,10.0,4.5.22,NESTOR,Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
101822,101823,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,4.5.23,ULYSSES,"Yet is the kindness but particular,"
101823,101824,Troilus and Cressida,11.0,4.5.24,ULYSSES,'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
101824,101825,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.5.25,NESTOR,And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
101825,101826,Troilus and Cressida,12.0,4.5.26,NESTOR,So much for Nestor.
101826,101827,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,4.5.27,ACHILLES,"I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:"
101827,101828,Troilus and Cressida,13.0,4.5.28,ACHILLES,Achilles bids you welcome.
101828,101829,Troilus and Cressida,14.0,4.5.29,MENELAUS,I had good argument for kissing once.
101829,101830,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.5.30,PATROCLUS,"But that's no argument for kissing now,"
101830,101831,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.5.31,PATROCLUS,"For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,"
101831,101832,Troilus and Cressida,15.0,4.5.32,PATROCLUS,And parted thus you and your argument.
101832,101833,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.5.33,ULYSSES,"O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!"
101833,101834,Troilus and Cressida,16.0,4.5.34,ULYSSES,For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
101834,101835,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.5.35,PATROCLUS,"The first was Menelaus' kiss, this, mine:"
101835,101836,Troilus and Cressida,17.0,4.5.36,PATROCLUS,Patroclus kisses you.
101836,101837,Troilus and Cressida,18.0,4.5.37,MENELAUS,"O, this is trim!"
101837,101838,Troilus and Cressida,19.0,4.5.38,PATROCLUS,Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
101838,101839,Troilus and Cressida,20.0,4.5.39,MENELAUS,"I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave."
101839,101840,Troilus and Cressida,21.0,4.5.40,CRESSIDA,"In kissing, do you render or receive?"
101840,101841,Troilus and Cressida,22.0,4.5.41,PATROCLUS,Both take and give.
101841,101842,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.5.42,CRESSIDA,"I'll make my match to live,"
101842,101843,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.5.43,CRESSIDA,"The kiss you take is better than you give,"
101843,101844,Troilus and Cressida,23.0,4.5.44,CRESSIDA,Therefore no kiss.
101844,101845,Troilus and Cressida,24.0,4.5.45,MENELAUS,"I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one."
101845,101846,Troilus and Cressida,25.0,4.5.46,CRESSIDA,"You're an odd man, give even or give none."
101846,101847,Troilus and Cressida,26.0,4.5.47,MENELAUS,"An odd man, lady! every man is odd."
101847,101848,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.5.48,CRESSIDA,"No, Paris is not, for you know 'tis true,"
101848,101849,Troilus and Cressida,27.0,4.5.49,CRESSIDA,"That you are odd, and he is even with you."
101849,101850,Troilus and Cressida,28.0,4.5.50,MENELAUS,You fillip me o' the head.
101850,101851,Troilus and Cressida,29.0,4.5.51,CRESSIDA,"No, I'll be sworn."
101851,101852,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,4.5.52,ULYSSES,"It were no match, your nail against his horn."
101852,101853,Troilus and Cressida,30.0,4.5.53,ULYSSES,"May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?"
101853,101854,Troilus and Cressida,31.0,4.5.54,CRESSIDA,You may.
101854,101855,Troilus and Cressida,32.0,4.5.55,ULYSSES,I do desire it.
101855,101856,Troilus and Cressida,33.0,4.5.56,CRESSIDA,"Why, beg, then."
101856,101857,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,4.5.57,ULYSSES,"Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,"
101857,101858,Troilus and Cressida,34.0,4.5.58,ULYSSES,"When Helen is a maid again, and his."
101858,101859,Troilus and Cressida,35.0,4.5.59,CRESSIDA,"I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due."
101859,101860,Troilus and Cressida,36.0,4.5.60,ULYSSES,"Never's my day, and then a kiss of you."
101860,101861,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,4.5.61,DIOMEDES,"Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father."
101861,101862,Troilus and Cressida,37.0,,DIOMEDES,Exit with CRESSIDA
101862,101863,Troilus and Cressida,38.0,4.5.62,NESTOR,A woman of quick sense.
101863,101864,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.63,ULYSSES,"Fie, fie upon her!"
101864,101865,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.64,ULYSSES,"There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,"
101865,101866,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.65,ULYSSES,"Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton spirits look out"
101866,101867,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.66,ULYSSES,At every joint and motive of her body.
101867,101868,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.67,ULYSSES,"O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,"
101868,101869,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.68,ULYSSES,"That give accosting welcome ere it comes,"
101869,101870,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.69,ULYSSES,And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
101870,101871,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.70,ULYSSES,To every ticklish reader! set them down
101871,101872,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.71,ULYSSES,For sluttish spoils of opportunity
101872,101873,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,4.5.72,ULYSSES,And daughters of the game.
101873,101874,Troilus and Cressida,39.0,,ULYSSES,Trumpet within
101874,101875,Troilus and Cressida,40.0,4.5.73,ALL,The Trojans' trumpet.
101875,101876,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.5.74,AGAMEMNON,Yonder comes the troop.
101876,101877,Troilus and Cressida,41.0,4.5.74,AGAMEMNON,"Enter HECTOR, armed, AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with Attendants"
101877,101878,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.75,AENEAS,"Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done"
101878,101879,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.76,AENEAS,To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
101879,101880,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.77,AENEAS,A victor shall be known? will you the knights
101880,101881,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.78,AENEAS,Shall to the edge of all extremity
101881,101882,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.79,AENEAS,"Pursue each other, or shall be divided"
101882,101883,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.80,AENEAS,By any voice or order of the field?
101883,101884,Troilus and Cressida,42.0,4.5.81,AENEAS,Hector bade ask.
101884,101885,Troilus and Cressida,43.0,4.5.82,AGAMEMNON,Which way would Hector have it?
101885,101886,Troilus and Cressida,44.0,4.5.83,AENEAS,"He cares not, he'll obey conditions."
101886,101887,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.5.84,ACHILLES,"'Tis done like Hector, but securely done,"
101887,101888,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.5.85,ACHILLES,"A little proudly, and great deal misprizing"
101888,101889,Troilus and Cressida,45.0,4.5.86,ACHILLES,The knight opposed.
101889,101890,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,4.5.87,AENEAS,"If not Achilles, sir,"
101890,101891,Troilus and Cressida,46.0,4.5.88,AENEAS,What is your name?
101891,101892,Troilus and Cressida,47.0,4.5.89,ACHILLES,"If not Achilles, nothing."
101892,101893,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.90,AENEAS,"Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:"
101893,101894,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.91,AENEAS,"In the extremity of great and little,"
101894,101895,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.92,AENEAS,"Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector,"
101895,101896,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.93,AENEAS,"The one almost as infinite as all,"
101896,101897,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.94,AENEAS,"The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,"
101897,101898,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.95,AENEAS,And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
101898,101899,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.96,AENEAS,This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
101899,101900,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.97,AENEAS,"In love whereof, half Hector stays at home,"
101900,101901,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.98,AENEAS,"Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek"
101901,101902,Troilus and Cressida,48.0,4.5.99,AENEAS,"This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek."
101902,101903,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,4.5.100,ACHILLES,"A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you."
101903,101904,Troilus and Cressida,49.0,,ACHILLES,Re-enter DIOMEDES
101904,101905,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.101,AGAMEMNON,"Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,"
101905,101906,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.102,AGAMEMNON,Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
101906,101907,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.103,AGAMEMNON,"Consent upon the order of their fight,"
101907,101908,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.104,AGAMEMNON,"So be it, either to the uttermost,"
101908,101909,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.105,AGAMEMNON,Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
101909,101910,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,4.5.106,AGAMEMNON,Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
101910,101911,Troilus and Cressida,50.0,,AGAMEMNON,AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists
101911,101912,Troilus and Cressida,51.0,4.5.107,ULYSSES,They are opposed already.
101912,101913,Troilus and Cressida,52.0,4.5.108,AGAMEMNON,What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
101913,101914,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.109,ULYSSES,"The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,"
101914,101915,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.110,ULYSSES,"Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,"
101915,101916,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.111,ULYSSES,"Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue,"
101916,101917,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.112,ULYSSES,Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
101917,101918,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.113,ULYSSES,"His heart and hand both open and both free,"
101918,101919,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.114,ULYSSES,"For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,"
101919,101920,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.115,ULYSSES,"Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,"
101920,101921,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.116,ULYSSES,"Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath,"
101921,101922,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.117,ULYSSES,"Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,"
101922,101923,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.118,ULYSSES,For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
101923,101924,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.119,ULYSSES,"To tender objects, but he in heat of action"
101924,101925,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.120,ULYSSES,Is more vindicative than jealous love:
101925,101926,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.121,ULYSSES,"They call him Troilus, and on him erect"
101926,101927,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.122,ULYSSES,"A second hope, as fairly built as Hector."
101927,101928,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.123,ULYSSES,"Thus says AEneas, one that knows the youth"
101928,101929,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.124,ULYSSES,"Even to his inches, and with private soul"
101929,101930,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,4.5.125,ULYSSES,Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
101930,101931,Troilus and Cressida,53.0,,ULYSSES,Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight
101931,101932,Troilus and Cressida,54.0,4.5.126,AGAMEMNON,They are in action.
101932,101933,Troilus and Cressida,55.0,4.5.127,NESTOR,"Now, Ajax, hold thine own!"
101933,101934,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,4.5.128,TROILUS,"Hector, thou sleep'st,"
101934,101935,Troilus and Cressida,56.0,4.5.129,TROILUS,Awake thee!
101935,101936,Troilus and Cressida,57.0,4.5.130,AGAMEMNON,"His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!"
101936,101937,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,4.5.131,DIOMEDES,You must no more.
101937,101938,Troilus and Cressida,58.0,,DIOMEDES,Trumpets cease
101938,101939,Troilus and Cressida,59.0,4.5.132,AENEAS,"Princes, enough, so please you."
101939,101940,Troilus and Cressida,60.0,4.5.133,AJAX,"I am not warm yet, let us fight again."
101940,101941,Troilus and Cressida,61.0,4.5.134,DIOMEDES,As Hector pleases.
101941,101942,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.135,HECTOR,"Why, then will I no more:"
101942,101943,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.136,HECTOR,"Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,"
101943,101944,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.137,HECTOR,"A cousin-german to great Priam's seed,"
101944,101945,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.138,HECTOR,The obligation of our blood forbids
101945,101946,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.139,HECTOR,A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
101946,101947,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.140,HECTOR,Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
101947,101948,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.141,HECTOR,"That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,"
101948,101949,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.142,HECTOR,"And this is Trojan, the sinews of this leg"
101949,101950,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.143,HECTOR,"All Greek, and this all Troy, my mother's blood"
101950,101951,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.144,HECTOR,"Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister"
101951,101952,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.145,HECTOR,"Bounds in my father's,' by Jove multipotent,"
101952,101953,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.146,HECTOR,Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
101953,101954,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.147,HECTOR,Wherein my sword had not impressure made
101954,101955,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.148,HECTOR,Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
101955,101956,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.149,HECTOR,"That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,"
101956,101957,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.150,HECTOR,"My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword"
101957,101958,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.151,HECTOR,"Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:"
101958,101959,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.152,HECTOR,"By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms,"
101959,101960,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.153,HECTOR,Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
101960,101961,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,4.5.154,HECTOR,"Cousin, all honour to thee!"
101961,101962,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.155,AJAX,"I thank thee, Hector"
101962,101963,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.156,AJAX,Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
101963,101964,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.157,AJAX,"I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence"
101964,101965,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,4.5.158,AJAX,A great addition earned in thy death.
101965,101966,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.159,HECTOR,"Not Neoptolemus so mirable,"
101966,101967,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.160,HECTOR,On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
101967,101968,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.161,HECTOR,"Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself"
101968,101969,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,4.5.162,HECTOR,A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
101969,101970,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,4.5.163,AENEAS,"There is expectance here from both the sides,"
101970,101971,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,4.5.164,AENEAS,What further you will do.
101971,101972,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,4.5.165,HECTOR,"We'll answer it,"
101972,101973,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,4.5.166,HECTOR,"The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell."
101973,101974,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,4.5.167,AJAX,If I might in entreaties find success--
101974,101975,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,4.5.168,AJAX,As seld I have the chance--I would desire
101975,101976,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,4.5.169,AJAX,My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
101976,101977,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,4.5.170,DIOMEDES,"'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles"
101977,101978,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,4.5.171,DIOMEDES,Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
101978,101979,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.172,HECTOR,"AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,"
101979,101980,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.173,HECTOR,And signify this loving interview
101980,101981,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.174,HECTOR,"To the expecters of our Trojan part,"
101981,101982,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.175,HECTOR,"Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin,"
101982,101983,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,4.5.176,HECTOR,I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
101983,101984,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,4.5.177,AJAX,Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
101984,101985,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,4.5.178,HECTOR,"The worthiest of them tell me name by name,"
101985,101986,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,4.5.179,HECTOR,"But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes"
101986,101987,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,4.5.180,HECTOR,Shall find him by his large and portly size.
101987,101988,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.181,AGAMEMNON,Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
101988,101989,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.182,AGAMEMNON,"That would be rid of such an enemy,"
101989,101990,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.183,AGAMEMNON,"But that's no welcome: understand more clear,"
101990,101991,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.184,AGAMEMNON,What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
101991,101992,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.185,AGAMEMNON,"And formless ruin of oblivion,"
101992,101993,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.186,AGAMEMNON,"But in this extant moment, faith and troth,"
101993,101994,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.187,AGAMEMNON,"Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,"
101994,101995,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.188,AGAMEMNON,"Bids thee, with most divine integrity,"
101995,101996,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,4.5.189,AGAMEMNON,"From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome."
101996,101997,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,4.5.190,HECTOR,"I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon."
101997,101998,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,4.5.191,AGAMEMNON,"[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, no"
101998,101999,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,4.5.192,AGAMEMNON,less to you.
101999,102000,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,4.5.193,MENELAUS,Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
102000,102001,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,4.5.194,MENELAUS,"You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither."

102007,102008,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,4.5.201,MENELAUS,"Name her not now, sir, she's a deadly theme."

102023,102024,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.217,NESTOR,"And once fought with him: he was a soldier good,"
102024,102025,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.218,NESTOR,"But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,"
102025,102026,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,4.5.219,NESTOR,"Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee,"

102030,102031,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,4.5.224,HECTOR,"Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee."
102031,102032,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,4.5.225,NESTOR,"I would my arms could match thee in contention,"
102032,102033,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,4.5.226,NESTOR,As they contend with thee in courtesy.
102033,102034,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,4.5.227,HECTOR,I would they could.
102034,102035,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,4.5.228,NESTOR,Ha!

102036,102037,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,4.5.230,NESTOR,"Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time."
102037,102038,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,4.5.231,ULYSSES,I wonder now how yonder city stands
102038,102039,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,4.5.232,ULYSSES,When we have here her base and pillar by us.
102039,102040,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,4.5.233,HECTOR,"I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well."
102040,102041,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,4.5.234,HECTOR,"Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,"
102041,102042,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,4.5.235,HECTOR,Since first I saw yourself and Diomed

102047,102048,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,4.5.241,ULYSSES,Must kiss their own feet.
102048,102049,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.242,HECTOR,I must not believe you:
102049,102050,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.243,HECTOR,"There they stand yet, and modestly I think,"
102050,102051,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,4.5.244,HECTOR,The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost

102054,102055,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,4.5.248,ULYSSES,So to him we leave it.
102055,102056,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,4.5.249,ULYSSES,"Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:"

102059,102060,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,4.5.253,ACHILLES,"Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee,"
102060,102061,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,4.5.254,ACHILLES,"I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,"
102061,102062,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,4.5.255,ACHILLES,And quoted joint by joint.
102062,102063,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,4.5.256,HECTOR,Is this Achilles?
102063,102064,Troilus and Cressida,94.0,4.5.257,ACHILLES,I am Achilles.
102064,102065,Troilus and Cressida,95.0,4.5.258,HECTOR,"Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee."
102065,102066,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,4.5.259,ACHILLES,Behold thy fill.
102066,102067,Troilus and Cressida,97.0,4.5.260,HECTOR,"Nay, I have done already."
102067,102068,Troilus and Cressida,98.0,4.5.261,ACHILLES,"Thou art too brief: I will the second time,"
102068,102069,Troilus and Cressida,98.0,4.5.262,ACHILLES,"As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb."
102069,102070,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,4.5.263,HECTOR,"O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er,"
102070,102071,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,4.5.264,HECTOR,But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
102071,102072,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,4.5.265,HECTOR,Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
102072,102073,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.266,ACHILLES,"Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body"
102073,102074,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.267,ACHILLES,"Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?"
102074,102075,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.268,ACHILLES,That I may give the local wound a name
102075,102076,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.269,ACHILLES,And make distinct the very breach whereout
102076,102077,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,4.5.270,ACHILLES,"Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!"
102077,102078,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.271,HECTOR,"It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,"
102078,102079,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.272,HECTOR,To answer such a question: stand again:
102079,102080,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.273,HECTOR,Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
102080,102081,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.274,HECTOR,As to prenominate in nice conjecture
102081,102082,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,4.5.275,HECTOR,Where thou wilt hit me dead?
102082,102083,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,4.5.276,ACHILLES,"I tell thee, yea."
102083,102084,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.277,HECTOR,"Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,"
102084,102085,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.278,HECTOR,"I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,"
102085,102086,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.279,HECTOR,"For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,"
102086,102087,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.280,HECTOR,"But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,"
102087,102088,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.281,HECTOR,"I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er."
102088,102089,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.282,HECTOR,"You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag,"
102089,102090,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.283,HECTOR,"His insolence draws folly from my lips,"
102090,102091,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.284,HECTOR,"But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,"
102091,102092,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,4.5.285,HECTOR,Or may I never--
102092,102093,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.286,AJAX,"Do not chafe thee, cousin:"
102093,102094,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.287,AJAX,"And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,"
102094,102095,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.288,AJAX,Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
102095,102096,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.289,AJAX,You may have every day enough of Hector

102097,102098,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,4.5.291,AJAX,Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
102098,102099,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,4.5.292,HECTOR,"I pray you, let us see you in the field:"
102099,102100,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,4.5.293,HECTOR,"We have had pelting wars, since you refused"
102100,102101,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,4.5.294,HECTOR,The Grecians' cause.
102101,102102,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,4.5.295,ACHILLES,"Dost thou entreat me, Hector?"
102102,102103,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,4.5.296,ACHILLES,"To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death,"
102103,102104,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,4.5.297,ACHILLES,To-night all friends.
102104,102105,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,4.5.298,HECTOR,Thy hand upon that match.

102107,102108,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.301,AGAMEMNON,As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
102108,102109,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.302,AGAMEMNON,"Concur together, severally entreat him."
102109,102110,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.303,AGAMEMNON,"Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,"
102110,102111,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,4.5.304,AGAMEMNON,That this great soldier may his welcome know.

102124,102125,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,4.5.317,ULYSSES,This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
102125,102126,Troilus and Cressida,112.0,4.5.318,ULYSSES,That wails her absence?

102127,102128,Troilus and Cressida,113.0,4.5.320,TROILUS,"A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?"

102332,102333,Troilus and Cressida,62.0,5.2.78,ULYSSES,"My lord,--"
102333,102334,Troilus and Cressida,63.0,5.2.79,TROILUS,"I will be patient, outwardly I will."
102334,102335,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,5.2.80,CRESSIDA,"You look upon that sleeve, behold it well."
102335,102336,Troilus and Cressida,64.0,5.2.81,CRESSIDA,He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
102336,102337,Troilus and Cressida,65.0,5.2.82,DIOMEDES,Whose was't?
102337,102338,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,5.2.83,CRESSIDA,"It is no matter, now I have't again."
102338,102339,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,5.2.84,CRESSIDA,I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
102339,102340,Troilus and Cressida,66.0,5.2.85,CRESSIDA,"I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more."
102340,102341,Troilus and Cressida,67.0,5.2.86,THERSITES,"Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!"
102341,102342,Troilus and Cressida,68.0,5.2.87,DIOMEDES,I shall have it.
102342,102343,Troilus and Cressida,69.0,5.2.88,CRESSIDA,"What, this?"
102343,102344,Troilus and Cressida,70.0,5.2.89,DIOMEDES,"Ay, that."
102344,102345,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.90,CRESSIDA,"O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!"
102345,102346,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.91,CRESSIDA,Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
102346,102347,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.92,CRESSIDA,"Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,"
102347,102348,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.93,CRESSIDA,"And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,"
102348,102349,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.94,CRESSIDA,"As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me,"
102349,102350,Troilus and Cressida,71.0,5.2.95,CRESSIDA,He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
102350,102351,Troilus and Cressida,72.0,5.2.96,DIOMEDES,"I had your heart before, this follows it."
102351,102352,Troilus and Cressida,73.0,5.2.97,TROILUS,I did swear patience.
102352,102353,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,5.2.98,CRESSIDA,"You shall not have it, Diomed, faith, you shall not,"
102353,102354,Troilus and Cressida,74.0,5.2.99,CRESSIDA,I'll give you something else.
102354,102355,Troilus and Cressida,75.0,5.2.100,DIOMEDES,I will have this: whose was it?
102355,102356,Troilus and Cressida,76.0,5.2.101,CRESSIDA,It is no matter.
102356,102357,Troilus and Cressida,77.0,5.2.102,DIOMEDES,"Come, tell me whose it was."
102357,102358,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,5.2.103,CRESSIDA,'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
102358,102359,Troilus and Cressida,78.0,5.2.104,CRESSIDA,"But, now you have it, take it."
102359,102360,Troilus and Cressida,79.0,5.2.105,DIOMEDES,Whose was it?
102360,102361,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,5.2.106,CRESSIDA,"By all Diana's waiting-women yond,"
102361,102362,Troilus and Cressida,80.0,5.2.107,CRESSIDA,"And by herself, I will not tell you whose."
102362,102363,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,5.2.108,DIOMEDES,"To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,"
102363,102364,Troilus and Cressida,81.0,5.2.109,DIOMEDES,And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
102364,102365,Troilus and Cressida,82.0,5.2.110,TROILUS,"Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,"
102365,102366,Troilus and Cressida,82.0,5.2.111,TROILUS,It should be challenged.
102366,102367,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,5.2.112,CRESSIDA,"Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not,"
102367,102368,Troilus and Cressida,83.0,5.2.113,CRESSIDA,I will not keep my word.
102368,102369,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,5.2.114,DIOMEDES,"Why, then, farewell,"
102369,102370,Troilus and Cressida,84.0,5.2.115,DIOMEDES,Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
102370,102371,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,5.2.116,CRESSIDA,"You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,"
102371,102372,Troilus and Cressida,85.0,5.2.117,CRESSIDA,But it straight starts you.
102372,102373,Troilus and Cressida,86.0,5.2.118,DIOMEDES,I do not like this fooling.
102373,102374,Troilus and Cressida,87.0,5.2.119,THERSITES,"Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best."
102374,102375,Troilus and Cressida,88.0,5.2.120,DIOMEDES,"What, shall I come? the hour?"
102375,102376,Troilus and Cressida,89.0,5.2.121,CRESSIDA,"Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued."
102376,102377,Troilus and Cressida,90.0,5.2.122,DIOMEDES,Farewell till then.
102377,102378,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.123,CRESSIDA,"Good night: I prithee, come."
102378,102379,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,,CRESSIDA,Exit DIOMEDES
102379,102380,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.124,CRESSIDA,"Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee"
102380,102381,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.125,CRESSIDA,But with my heart the other eye doth see.
102381,102382,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.126,CRESSIDA,"Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,"
102382,102383,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.127,CRESSIDA,The error of our eye directs our mind:
102383,102384,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.128,CRESSIDA,"What error leads must err, O, then conclude"
102384,102385,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,5.2.129,CRESSIDA,Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
102385,102386,Troilus and Cressida,91.0,,CRESSIDA,Exit
102386,102387,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,5.2.130,THERSITES,"A proof of strength she could not publish more,"
102387,102388,Troilus and Cressida,92.0,5.2.131,THERSITES,Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'
102388,102389,Troilus and Cressida,93.0,5.2.132,ULYSSES,"All's done, my lord."
102389,102390,Troilus and Cressida,94.0,5.2.133,TROILUS,It is.
102390,102391,Troilus and Cressida,95.0,5.2.134,ULYSSES,"Why stay we, then?"
102391,102392,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.135,TROILUS,To make a recordation to my soul
102392,102393,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.136,TROILUS,Of every syllable that here was spoke.
102393,102394,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.137,TROILUS,"But if I tell how these two did co-act,"
102394,102395,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.138,TROILUS,Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
102395,102396,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.139,TROILUS,"Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,"
102396,102397,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.140,TROILUS,"An esperance so obstinately strong,"
102397,102398,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.141,TROILUS,"That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,"
102398,102399,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.142,TROILUS,"As if those organs had deceptious functions,"
102399,102400,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.143,TROILUS,Created only to calumniate.
102400,102401,Troilus and Cressida,96.0,5.2.144,TROILUS,Was Cressid here?
102401,102402,Troilus and Cressida,97.0,5.2.145,ULYSSES,"I cannot conjure, Trojan."
102402,102403,Troilus and Cressida,98.0,5.2.146,TROILUS,"She was not, sure."
102403,102404,Troilus and Cressida,99.0,5.2.147,ULYSSES,Most sure she was.
102404,102405,Troilus and Cressida,100.0,5.2.148,TROILUS,"Why, my negation hath no taste of madness."
102405,102406,Troilus and Cressida,101.0,5.2.149,ULYSSES,"Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now."
102406,102407,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.150,TROILUS,Let it not be believed for womanhood!
102407,102408,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.151,TROILUS,"Think, we had mothers, do not give advantage"
102408,102409,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.152,TROILUS,"To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,"
102409,102410,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.153,TROILUS,"For depravation, to square the general sex"
102410,102411,Troilus and Cressida,102.0,5.2.154,TROILUS,By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
102411,102412,Troilus and Cressida,103.0,5.2.155,ULYSSES,"What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?"
102412,102413,Troilus and Cressida,104.0,5.2.156,TROILUS,"Nothing at all, unless that this were she."
102413,102414,Troilus and Cressida,105.0,5.2.157,THERSITES,Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
102414,102415,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.158,TROILUS,"This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:"

102417,102418,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.161,TROILUS,"If sanctimony be the gods' delight,"
102418,102419,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.162,TROILUS,"If there be rule in unity itself,"
102419,102420,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.163,TROILUS,"This is not she. O madness of discourse,"
102420,102421,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.164,TROILUS,That cause sets up with and against itself!
102421,102422,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.165,TROILUS,Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
102422,102423,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.166,TROILUS,"Without perdition, and loss assume all reason"
102423,102424,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.167,TROILUS,"Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid."
102424,102425,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.168,TROILUS,Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
102425,102426,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.169,TROILUS,Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
102426,102427,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.170,TROILUS,"Divides more wider than the sky and earth,"
102427,102428,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.171,TROILUS,And yet the spacious breadth of this division
102428,102429,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.172,TROILUS,Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
102429,102430,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.173,TROILUS,As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
102430,102431,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.174,TROILUS,"Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates,"
102431,102432,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.175,TROILUS,"Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:"
102432,102433,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.176,TROILUS,"Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself,"
102433,102434,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.177,TROILUS,"The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed,"
102434,102435,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.178,TROILUS,"And with another knot, five-finger-tied,"
102435,102436,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.179,TROILUS,"The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,"

102437,102438,Troilus and Cressida,106.0,5.2.181,TROILUS,"Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed."
102438,102439,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,5.2.182,ULYSSES,May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
102439,102440,Troilus and Cressida,107.0,5.2.183,ULYSSES,With that which here his passion doth express?
102440,102441,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.184,TROILUS,"Ay, Greek, and that shall be divulged well"
102441,102442,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.185,TROILUS,In characters as red as Mars his heart
102442,102443,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.186,TROILUS,Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
102443,102444,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.187,TROILUS,With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
102444,102445,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.188,TROILUS,"Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,"
102445,102446,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.189,TROILUS,So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
102446,102447,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.190,TROILUS,"That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm,"
102447,102448,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.191,TROILUS,"Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,"
102448,102449,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.192,TROILUS,My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
102449,102450,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.193,TROILUS,"Which shipmen do the hurricano call,"
102450,102451,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.194,TROILUS,"Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,"
102451,102452,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.195,TROILUS,Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
102452,102453,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.196,TROILUS,In his descent than shall my prompted sword
102453,102454,Troilus and Cressida,108.0,5.2.197,TROILUS,Falling on Diomed.
102454,102455,Troilus and Cressida,109.0,5.2.198,THERSITES,He'll tickle it for his concupy.
102455,102456,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,5.2.199,TROILUS,"O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!"
102456,102457,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,5.2.200,TROILUS,"Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,"
102457,102458,Troilus and Cressida,110.0,5.2.201,TROILUS,And they'll seem glorious.

102837,102838,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,AGAMEMNON,"Exeunt, marching"
102838,102839,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,AGAMEMNON,SCENE X. Another part of the plains.
102839,102840,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,,AGAMEMNON,Enter AENEAS and Trojans
102840,102841,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,5.10.1,AENEAS,"Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:"
102841,102842,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,5.10.2,AENEAS,"Never go home, here starve we out the night."
102842,102843,Troilus and Cressida,1.0,,AENEAS,Enter TROILUS
102843,102844,Troilus and Cressida,2.0,5.10.3,TROILUS,Hector is slain.
102844,102845,Troilus and Cressida,3.0,5.10.4,ALL,Hector! the gods forbid!
102845,102846,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,5.10.5,TROILUS,"He's dead, and at the murderer's horse's tail,"
102846,102847,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,5.10.6,TROILUS,"In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field."
102847,102848,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,5.10.7,TROILUS,"Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!"
102848,102849,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,5.10.8,TROILUS,"Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!"
102849,102850,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,5.10.9,TROILUS,"I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,"
102850,102851,Troilus and Cressida,4.0,5.10.10,TROILUS,And linger not our sure destructions on!
102851,102852,Troilus and Cressida,5.0,5.10.11,AENEAS,"My lord, you do discomfort all the host!"
102852,102853,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.12,TROILUS,You understand me not that tell me so:
102853,102854,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.13,TROILUS,"I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,"
102854,102855,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.14,TROILUS,But dare all imminence that gods and men
102855,102856,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.15,TROILUS,Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
102856,102857,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.16,TROILUS,"Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?"
102857,102858,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.17,TROILUS,"Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,"
102858,102859,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.18,TROILUS,"Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:"
102859,102860,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.19,TROILUS,"There is a word will Priam turn to stone,"
102860,102861,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.20,TROILUS,"Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,"
102861,102862,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.21,TROILUS,"Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,"
102862,102863,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.22,TROILUS,"Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:"
102863,102864,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.23,TROILUS,"Hector is dead, there is no more to say."
102864,102865,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.24,TROILUS,"Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,"
102865,102866,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.25,TROILUS,"Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,"
102866,102867,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.26,TROILUS,"Let Titan rise as early as he dare,"
102867,102868,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.27,TROILUS,"I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,"
102868,102869,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.28,TROILUS,No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
102869,102870,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.29,TROILUS,"I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,"
102870,102871,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.30,TROILUS,That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
102871,102872,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.31,TROILUS,Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
102872,102873,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,5.10.32,TROILUS,Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
102873,102874,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,,TROILUS,Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans
102874,102875,Troilus and Cressida,6.0,,TROILUS,"As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other side, PANDARUS"
102875,102876,Troilus and Cressida,7.0,5.10.33,PANDARUS,"But hear you, hear you!"
102876,102877,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,5.10.34,TROILUS,"Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame"
102877,102878,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,5.10.35,TROILUS,"Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!"
102878,102879,Troilus and Cressida,8.0,,TROILUS,Exit
102879,102880,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.36,PANDARUS,A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!
102880,102881,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.37,PANDARUS,world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
102881,102882,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.38,PANDARUS,"O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set"
102882,102883,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.39,PANDARUS,"a-work, and how ill requited! why should our"
102883,102884,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.40,PANDARUS,endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
102884,102885,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.41,PANDARUS,what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:
102885,102886,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.42,PANDARUS,"Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,"
102886,102887,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.43,PANDARUS,"Till he hath lost his honey and his sting,"
102887,102888,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.44,PANDARUS,"And being once subdued in armed tail,"
102888,102889,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.45,PANDARUS,Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
102889,102890,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.46,PANDARUS,"Good traders in the flesh, set this in your"
102890,102891,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.47,PANDARUS,painted cloths.
102891,102892,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.48,PANDARUS,"As many as be here of pander's hall,"
102892,102893,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.49,PANDARUS,"Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall,"
102893,102894,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.50,PANDARUS,"Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,"
102894,102895,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.51,PANDARUS,"Though not for me, yet for your aching bones."
102895,102896,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.52,PANDARUS,"Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,"
102896,102897,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.53,PANDARUS,Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
102897,102898,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.54,PANDARUS,"It should be now, but that my fear is this,"
102898,102899,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.55,PANDARUS,Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
102899,102900,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.56,PANDARUS,"Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,"
102900,102901,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,5.10.57,PANDARUS,And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.
102901,102902,Troilus and Cressida,9.0,,PANDARUS,Exit

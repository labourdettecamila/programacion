36681,36682,Henry V,1.0,1.0.3,Chorus,"A kingdom for a stage, princes to act"
36682,36683,Henry V,1.0,1.0.4,Chorus,And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
36683,36684,Henry V,1.0,1.0.5,Chorus,"Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,"
36684,36685,Henry V,1.0,1.0.6,Chorus,"Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels,"
36685,36686,Henry V,1.0,1.0.7,Chorus,"Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire"
36686,36687,Henry V,1.0,1.0.8,Chorus,"Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,"
36687,36688,Henry V,1.0,1.0.9,Chorus,The flat unraised spirits that have dared
36688,36689,Henry V,1.0,1.0.10,Chorus,On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
36689,36690,Henry V,1.0,1.0.11,Chorus,So great an object: can this cockpit hold
36690,36691,Henry V,1.0,1.0.12,Chorus,The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
36691,36692,Henry V,1.0,1.0.13,Chorus,Within this wooden O the very casques
36692,36693,Henry V,1.0,1.0.14,Chorus,That did affright the air at Agincourt?
36693,36694,Henry V,1.0,1.0.15,Chorus,"O, pardon! since a crooked figure may"
36694,36695,Henry V,1.0,1.0.16,Chorus,"Attest in little place a million,"
36695,36696,Henry V,1.0,1.0.17,Chorus,"And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,"
36696,36697,Henry V,1.0,1.0.18,Chorus,On your imaginary forces work.
36697,36698,Henry V,1.0,1.0.19,Chorus,Suppose within the girdle of these walls
36698,36699,Henry V,1.0,1.0.20,Chorus,"Are now confined two mighty monarchies,"
36699,36700,Henry V,1.0,1.0.21,Chorus,Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
36700,36701,Henry V,1.0,1.0.22,Chorus,The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
36701,36702,Henry V,1.0,1.0.23,Chorus,"Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts,"
36702,36703,Henry V,1.0,1.0.24,Chorus,"Into a thousand parts divide on man,"
36703,36704,Henry V,1.0,1.0.25,Chorus,"And make imaginary puissance,"
36704,36705,Henry V,1.0,1.0.26,Chorus,"Think when we talk of horses, that you see them"
36705,36706,Henry V,1.0,1.0.27,Chorus,"Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth,"
36706,36707,Henry V,1.0,1.0.28,Chorus,"For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,"
36707,36708,Henry V,1.0,1.0.29,Chorus,"Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,"
36708,36709,Henry V,1.0,1.0.30,Chorus,Turning the accomplishment of many years
36709,36710,Henry V,1.0,1.0.31,Chorus,"Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,"
36710,36711,Henry V,1.0,1.0.32,Chorus,"Admit me Chorus to this history,"
36711,36712,Henry V,1.0,1.0.33,Chorus,"Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,"
36712,36713,Henry V,1.0,1.0.34,Chorus,"Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play."
36713,36714,Henry V,1.0,,Chorus,Exit
36714,36715,Henry V,1.0,,Chorus,SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.
36715,36716,Henry V,1.0,,Chorus,"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY"
36716,36717,Henry V,1.0,1.1.1,CANTERBURY,"My lord, I'll tell you, that self bill is urged,"
36717,36718,Henry V,1.0,1.1.2,CANTERBURY,Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
36718,36719,Henry V,1.0,1.1.3,CANTERBURY,"Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,"
36719,36720,Henry V,1.0,1.1.4,CANTERBURY,But that the scambling and unquiet time
36720,36721,Henry V,1.0,1.1.5,CANTERBURY,Did push it out of farther question.
36721,36722,Henry V,2.0,1.1.6,ELY,"But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?"
36722,36723,Henry V,3.0,1.1.7,CANTERBURY,"It must be thought on. If it pass against us,"
36723,36724,Henry V,3.0,1.1.8,CANTERBURY,We lose the better half of our possession:
36724,36725,Henry V,3.0,1.1.9,CANTERBURY,For all the temporal lands which men devout
36725,36726,Henry V,3.0,1.1.10,CANTERBURY,By testament have given to the church
36726,36727,Henry V,3.0,1.1.11,CANTERBURY,"Would they strip from us, being valued thus:"
36727,36728,Henry V,3.0,1.1.12,CANTERBURY,"As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,"
36728,36729,Henry V,3.0,1.1.13,CANTERBURY,"Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,"
36729,36730,Henry V,3.0,1.1.14,CANTERBURY,"Six thousand and two hundred good esquires,"
36730,36731,Henry V,3.0,1.1.15,CANTERBURY,"And, to relief of lazars and weak age,"
36731,36732,Henry V,3.0,1.1.16,CANTERBURY,Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
36732,36733,Henry V,3.0,1.1.17,CANTERBURY,"A hundred almshouses right well supplied,"
36733,36734,Henry V,3.0,1.1.18,CANTERBURY,"And to the coffers of the king beside,"
36734,36735,Henry V,3.0,1.1.19,CANTERBURY,A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
36735,36736,Henry V,4.0,1.1.20,ELY,This would drink deep.
36736,36737,Henry V,5.0,1.1.21,CANTERBURY,'Twould drink the cup and all.
36737,36738,Henry V,6.0,1.1.22,ELY,But what prevention?
36738,36739,Henry V,7.0,1.1.23,CANTERBURY,The king is full of grace and fair regard.
36739,36740,Henry V,8.0,1.1.24,ELY,And a true lover of the holy church.
36740,36741,Henry V,9.0,1.1.25,CANTERBURY,The courses of his youth promised it not.
36741,36742,Henry V,9.0,1.1.26,CANTERBURY,"The breath no sooner left his father's body,"
36742,36743,Henry V,9.0,1.1.27,CANTERBURY,"But that his wildness, mortified in him,"
36743,36744,Henry V,9.0,1.1.28,CANTERBURY,"Seem'd to die too, yea, at that very moment"
36744,36745,Henry V,9.0,1.1.29,CANTERBURY,"Consideration, like an angel, came"
36745,36746,Henry V,9.0,1.1.30,CANTERBURY,"And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,"
36746,36747,Henry V,9.0,1.1.31,CANTERBURY,"Leaving his body as a paradise,"
36747,36748,Henry V,9.0,1.1.32,CANTERBURY,To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
36748,36749,Henry V,9.0,1.1.33,CANTERBURY,"Never was such a sudden scholar made,"
36749,36750,Henry V,9.0,1.1.34,CANTERBURY,"Never came reformation in a flood,"
36750,36751,Henry V,9.0,1.1.35,CANTERBURY,"With such a heady currance, scouring faults"
36751,36752,Henry V,9.0,1.1.36,CANTERBURY,Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
36752,36753,Henry V,9.0,1.1.37,CANTERBURY,So soon did lose his seat and all at once
36753,36754,Henry V,9.0,1.1.38,CANTERBURY,As in this king.
36754,36755,Henry V,10.0,1.1.39,ELY,We are blessed in the change.
36755,36756,Henry V,11.0,1.1.40,CANTERBURY,"Hear him but reason in divinity,"
36756,36757,Henry V,11.0,1.1.41,CANTERBURY,And all-admiring with an inward wish
36757,36758,Henry V,11.0,1.1.42,CANTERBURY,You would desire the king were made a prelate:
36758,36759,Henry V,11.0,1.1.43,CANTERBURY,"Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,"
36759,36760,Henry V,11.0,1.1.44,CANTERBURY,You would say it hath been all in all his study:
36760,36761,Henry V,11.0,1.1.45,CANTERBURY,"List his discourse of war, and you shall hear"
36761,36762,Henry V,11.0,1.1.46,CANTERBURY,A fearful battle render'd you in music:
36762,36763,Henry V,11.0,1.1.47,CANTERBURY,"Turn him to any cause of policy,"
36763,36764,Henry V,11.0,1.1.48,CANTERBURY,"The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,"
36764,36765,Henry V,11.0,1.1.49,CANTERBURY,"Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,"
36765,36766,Henry V,11.0,1.1.50,CANTERBURY,"The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,"
36766,36767,Henry V,11.0,1.1.51,CANTERBURY,"And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,"
36767,36768,Henry V,11.0,1.1.52,CANTERBURY,"To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences,"
36768,36769,Henry V,11.0,1.1.53,CANTERBURY,So that the art and practic part of life
36769,36770,Henry V,11.0,1.1.54,CANTERBURY,Must be the mistress to this theoric:
36770,36771,Henry V,11.0,1.1.55,CANTERBURY,"Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,"
36771,36772,Henry V,11.0,1.1.56,CANTERBURY,"Since his addiction was to courses vain,"
36772,36773,Henry V,11.0,1.1.57,CANTERBURY,"His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,"
36773,36774,Henry V,11.0,1.1.58,CANTERBURY,"His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,"
36774,36775,Henry V,11.0,1.1.59,CANTERBURY,"And never noted in him any study,"
36775,36776,Henry V,11.0,1.1.60,CANTERBURY,"Any retirement, any sequestration"
36776,36777,Henry V,11.0,1.1.61,CANTERBURY,From open haunts and popularity.
36777,36778,Henry V,12.0,1.1.62,ELY,The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
36778,36779,Henry V,12.0,1.1.63,ELY,And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
36779,36780,Henry V,12.0,1.1.64,ELY,Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
36780,36781,Henry V,12.0,1.1.65,ELY,And so the prince obscured his contemplation
36781,36782,Henry V,12.0,1.1.66,ELY,"Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,"
36782,36783,Henry V,12.0,1.1.67,ELY,"Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,"
36783,36784,Henry V,12.0,1.1.68,ELY,"Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty."
36784,36785,Henry V,13.0,1.1.69,CANTERBURY,"It must be so, for miracles are ceased,"
36785,36786,Henry V,13.0,1.1.70,CANTERBURY,And therefore we must needs admit the means
36786,36787,Henry V,13.0,1.1.71,CANTERBURY,How things are perfected.
36787,36788,Henry V,14.0,1.1.72,ELY,"But, my good lord,"
36788,36789,Henry V,14.0,1.1.73,ELY,How now for mitigation of this bill
36789,36790,Henry V,14.0,1.1.74,ELY,Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
36790,36791,Henry V,14.0,1.1.75,ELY,"Incline to it, or no?"
36791,36792,Henry V,15.0,1.1.76,CANTERBURY,"He seems indifferent,"
36792,36793,Henry V,15.0,1.1.77,CANTERBURY,Or rather swaying more upon our part
36793,36794,Henry V,15.0,1.1.78,CANTERBURY,"Than cherishing the exhibiters against us,"
36794,36795,Henry V,15.0,1.1.79,CANTERBURY,"For I have made an offer to his majesty,"
36795,36796,Henry V,15.0,1.1.80,CANTERBURY,Upon our spiritual convocation
36796,36797,Henry V,15.0,1.1.81,CANTERBURY,"And in regard of causes now in hand,"
36797,36798,Henry V,15.0,1.1.82,CANTERBURY,"Which I have open'd to his grace at large,"
36798,36799,Henry V,15.0,1.1.83,CANTERBURY,"As touching France, to give a greater sum"
36799,36800,Henry V,15.0,1.1.84,CANTERBURY,Than ever at one time the clergy yet
36800,36801,Henry V,15.0,1.1.85,CANTERBURY,Did to his predecessors part withal.
36801,36802,Henry V,16.0,1.1.86,ELY,"How did this offer seem received, my lord?"
36802,36803,Henry V,17.0,1.1.87,CANTERBURY,"With good acceptance of his majesty,"
36803,36804,Henry V,17.0,1.1.88,CANTERBURY,"Save that there was not time enough to hear,"
36804,36805,Henry V,17.0,1.1.89,CANTERBURY,"As I perceived his grace would fain have done,"
36805,36806,Henry V,17.0,1.1.90,CANTERBURY,The severals and unhidden passages
36806,36807,Henry V,17.0,1.1.91,CANTERBURY,Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
36807,36808,Henry V,17.0,1.1.92,CANTERBURY,And generally to the crown and seat of France
36808,36809,Henry V,17.0,1.1.93,CANTERBURY,"Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather."
36809,36810,Henry V,18.0,1.1.94,ELY,What was the impediment that broke this off?
36810,36811,Henry V,19.0,1.1.95,CANTERBURY,The French ambassador upon that instant
36811,36812,Henry V,19.0,1.1.96,CANTERBURY,"Craved audience, and the hour, I think, is come"
36812,36813,Henry V,19.0,1.1.97,CANTERBURY,To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
36813,36814,Henry V,20.0,1.1.98,ELY,It is.
36814,36815,Henry V,21.0,1.1.99,CANTERBURY,"Then go we in, to know his embassy,"
36815,36816,Henry V,21.0,1.1.100,CANTERBURY,"Which I could with a ready guess declare,"
36816,36817,Henry V,21.0,1.1.101,CANTERBURY,Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
36817,36818,Henry V,22.0,1.1.102,ELY,"I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it."
36818,36819,Henry V,22.0,,ELY,Exeunt
36819,36820,Henry V,22.0,,ELY,SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.
36820,36821,Henry V,22.0,,ELY,"Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants"
36821,36822,Henry V,1.0,1.2.1,KING HENRY V,Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
36822,36823,Henry V,2.0,1.2.2,EXETER,Not here in presence.
36823,36824,Henry V,3.0,1.2.3,KING HENRY V,"Send for him, good uncle."
36824,36825,Henry V,4.0,1.2.4,WESTMORELAND,"Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?"
36825,36826,Henry V,5.0,1.2.5,KING HENRY V,"Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,"
36826,36827,Henry V,5.0,1.2.6,KING HENRY V,"Before we hear him, of some things of weight"
36827,36828,Henry V,5.0,1.2.7,KING HENRY V,"That task our thoughts, concerning us and France."
36828,36829,Henry V,5.0,,KING HENRY V,"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY"
36829,36830,Henry V,6.0,1.2.8,CANTERBURY,God and his angels guard your sacred throne
36830,36831,Henry V,6.0,1.2.9,CANTERBURY,And make you long become it!
36831,36832,Henry V,7.0,1.2.10,KING HENRY V,"Sure, we thank you."
36832,36833,Henry V,7.0,1.2.11,KING HENRY V,"My learned lord, we pray you to proceed"
36833,36834,Henry V,7.0,1.2.12,KING HENRY V,And justly and religiously unfold
36834,36835,Henry V,7.0,1.2.13,KING HENRY V,Why the law Salique that they have in France
36835,36836,Henry V,7.0,1.2.14,KING HENRY V,"Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:"
36836,36837,Henry V,7.0,1.2.15,KING HENRY V,"And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,"
36837,36838,Henry V,7.0,1.2.16,KING HENRY V,"That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,"
36838,36839,Henry V,7.0,1.2.17,KING HENRY V,Or nicely charge your understanding soul
36839,36840,Henry V,7.0,1.2.18,KING HENRY V,"With opening titles miscreate, whose right"
36840,36841,Henry V,7.0,1.2.19,KING HENRY V,"Suits not in native colours with the truth,"
36841,36842,Henry V,7.0,1.2.20,KING HENRY V,For God doth know how many now in health
36842,36843,Henry V,7.0,1.2.21,KING HENRY V,Shall drop their blood in approbation
36843,36844,Henry V,7.0,1.2.22,KING HENRY V,Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
36844,36845,Henry V,7.0,1.2.23,KING HENRY V,"Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,"
36845,36846,Henry V,7.0,1.2.24,KING HENRY V,How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
36846,36847,Henry V,7.0,1.2.25,KING HENRY V,"We charge you, in the name of God, take heed,"
36847,36848,Henry V,7.0,1.2.26,KING HENRY V,For never two such kingdoms did contend
36848,36849,Henry V,7.0,1.2.27,KING HENRY V,"Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops"
36849,36850,Henry V,7.0,1.2.28,KING HENRY V,"Are every one a woe, a sore complaint"
36850,36851,Henry V,7.0,1.2.29,KING HENRY V,'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
36851,36852,Henry V,7.0,1.2.30,KING HENRY V,That make such waste in brief mortality.
36852,36853,Henry V,7.0,1.2.31,KING HENRY V,"Under this conjuration, speak, my lord,"
36853,36854,Henry V,7.0,1.2.32,KING HENRY V,"For we will hear, note and believe in heart"
36854,36855,Henry V,7.0,1.2.33,KING HENRY V,That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
36855,36856,Henry V,7.0,1.2.34,KING HENRY V,As pure as sin with baptism.
36856,36857,Henry V,8.0,1.2.35,CANTERBURY,"Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,"
36857,36858,Henry V,8.0,1.2.36,CANTERBURY,"That owe yourselves, your lives and services"
36858,36859,Henry V,8.0,1.2.37,CANTERBURY,To this imperial throne. There is no bar
36859,36860,Henry V,8.0,1.2.38,CANTERBURY,To make against your highness' claim to France
36860,36861,Henry V,8.0,1.2.39,CANTERBURY,"But this, which they produce from Pharamond,"
36861,36862,Henry V,8.0,1.2.40,CANTERBURY,'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
36862,36863,Henry V,8.0,1.2.41,CANTERBURY,'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
36863,36864,Henry V,8.0,1.2.42,CANTERBURY,Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
36864,36865,Henry V,8.0,1.2.43,CANTERBURY,"To be the realm of France, and Pharamond"
36865,36866,Henry V,8.0,1.2.44,CANTERBURY,The founder of this law and female bar.
36866,36867,Henry V,8.0,1.2.45,CANTERBURY,Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
36867,36868,Henry V,8.0,1.2.46,CANTERBURY,"That the land Salique is in Germany,"
36868,36869,Henry V,8.0,1.2.47,CANTERBURY,"Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,"
36869,36870,Henry V,8.0,1.2.48,CANTERBURY,"Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,"
36870,36871,Henry V,8.0,1.2.49,CANTERBURY,"There left behind and settled certain French,"
36871,36872,Henry V,8.0,1.2.50,CANTERBURY,"Who, holding in disdain the German women"
36872,36873,Henry V,8.0,1.2.51,CANTERBURY,"For some dishonest manners of their life,"
36873,36874,Henry V,8.0,1.2.52,CANTERBURY,"Establish'd then this law, to wit, no female"
36874,36875,Henry V,8.0,1.2.53,CANTERBURY,Should be inheritrix in Salique land:

36876,36877,Henry V,8.0,1.2.55,CANTERBURY,Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
36877,36878,Henry V,8.0,1.2.56,CANTERBURY,Then doth it well appear that Salique law
36878,36879,Henry V,8.0,1.2.57,CANTERBURY,Was not devised for the realm of France:
36879,36880,Henry V,8.0,1.2.58,CANTERBURY,Nor did the French possess the Salique land
36880,36881,Henry V,8.0,1.2.59,CANTERBURY,Until four hundred one and twenty years
36881,36882,Henry V,8.0,1.2.60,CANTERBURY,"After defunction of King Pharamond,"

36883,36884,Henry V,8.0,1.2.62,CANTERBURY,Who died within the year of our redemption
36884,36885,Henry V,8.0,1.2.63,CANTERBURY,"Four hundred twenty-six, and Charles the Great"
36885,36886,Henry V,8.0,1.2.64,CANTERBURY,"Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French"
36886,36887,Henry V,8.0,1.2.65,CANTERBURY,"Beyond the river Sala, in the year"

36897,36898,Henry V,8.0,1.2.76,CANTERBURY,"Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,"
36898,36899,Henry V,8.0,1.2.77,CANTERBURY,"Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son"

36908,36909,Henry V,8.0,1.2.87,CANTERBURY,Was re-united to the crown of France.
36909,36910,Henry V,8.0,1.2.88,CANTERBURY,"So that, as clear as is the summer's sun."
36910,36911,Henry V,8.0,1.2.89,CANTERBURY,"King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,"
36911,36912,Henry V,8.0,1.2.90,CANTERBURY,"King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear"
36912,36913,Henry V,8.0,1.2.91,CANTERBURY,To hold in right and title of the female:

36914,36915,Henry V,8.0,1.2.93,CANTERBURY,Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law

36916,36917,Henry V,8.0,1.2.95,CANTERBURY,And rather choose to hide them in a net
36917,36918,Henry V,8.0,1.2.96,CANTERBURY,Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
36918,36919,Henry V,8.0,1.2.97,CANTERBURY,Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
36919,36920,Henry V,9.0,1.2.98,KING HENRY V,May I with right and conscience make this claim?

36921,36922,Henry V,10.0,1.2.100,CANTERBURY,"For in the book of Numbers is it writ,"

36933,36934,Henry V,10.0,1.2.112,CANTERBURY,Forage in blood of French nobility.
36934,36935,Henry V,10.0,1.2.113,CANTERBURY,O noble English. that could entertain

36969,36970,Henry V,17.0,1.2.148,KING HENRY V,For you shall read that my great-grandfather

36971,36972,Henry V,17.0,1.2.150,KING HENRY V,But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
36972,36973,Henry V,17.0,1.2.151,KING HENRY V,"Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,"
36973,36974,Henry V,17.0,1.2.152,KING HENRY V,"With ample and brim fulness of his force,"

36976,36977,Henry V,17.0,1.2.155,KING HENRY V,"That England, being empty of defence,"
36977,36978,Henry V,17.0,1.2.156,KING HENRY V,Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
36978,36979,Henry V,18.0,1.2.157,CANTERBURY,"She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege,"
36979,36980,Henry V,18.0,1.2.158,CANTERBURY,For hear her but exampled by herself:

37051,37052,Henry V,22.0,1.2.229,KING HENRY V,Ruling in large and ample empery
37052,37053,Henry V,22.0,1.2.230,KING HENRY V,"O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,"
37053,37054,Henry V,22.0,1.2.231,KING HENRY V,"Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,"
37054,37055,Henry V,22.0,1.2.232,KING HENRY V,"Tombless, with no remembrance over them:"
37055,37056,Henry V,22.0,1.2.233,KING HENRY V,Either our history shall with full mouth
37056,37057,Henry V,22.0,1.2.234,KING HENRY V,"Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,"
37057,37058,Henry V,22.0,1.2.235,KING HENRY V,"Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,"
37058,37059,Henry V,22.0,1.2.236,KING HENRY V,Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
37059,37060,Henry V,22.0,,KING HENRY V,Enter Ambassadors of France
37060,37061,Henry V,22.0,1.2.237,KING HENRY V,Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
37061,37062,Henry V,22.0,1.2.238,KING HENRY V,"Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear"
37062,37063,Henry V,22.0,1.2.239,KING HENRY V,"Your greeting is from him, not from the king."
37063,37064,Henry V,23.0,1.2.240,First Ambassador,May't please your majesty to give us leave
37064,37065,Henry V,23.0,1.2.241,First Ambassador,"Freely to render what we have in charge,"
37065,37066,Henry V,23.0,1.2.242,First Ambassador,Or shall we sparingly show you far off
37066,37067,Henry V,23.0,1.2.243,First Ambassador,The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
37067,37068,Henry V,24.0,1.2.244,KING HENRY V,"We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,"
37068,37069,Henry V,24.0,1.2.245,KING HENRY V,Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
37069,37070,Henry V,24.0,1.2.246,KING HENRY V,As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
37070,37071,Henry V,24.0,1.2.247,KING HENRY V,Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
37071,37072,Henry V,24.0,1.2.248,KING HENRY V,Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
37072,37073,Henry V,25.0,1.2.249,First Ambassador,"Thus, then, in few."
37073,37074,Henry V,25.0,1.2.250,First Ambassador,"Your highness, lately sending into France,"
37074,37075,Henry V,25.0,1.2.251,First Ambassador,"Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right"
37075,37076,Henry V,25.0,1.2.252,First Ambassador,"Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third."
37076,37077,Henry V,25.0,1.2.253,First Ambassador,"In answer of which claim, the prince our master"
37077,37078,Henry V,25.0,1.2.254,First Ambassador,"Says that you savour too much of your youth,"
37078,37079,Henry V,25.0,1.2.255,First Ambassador,And bids you be advised there's nought in France
37079,37080,Henry V,25.0,1.2.256,First Ambassador,"That can be with a nimble galliard won,"
37080,37081,Henry V,25.0,1.2.257,First Ambassador,You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
37081,37082,Henry V,25.0,1.2.258,First Ambassador,"He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,"
37082,37083,Henry V,25.0,1.2.259,First Ambassador,"This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this,"
37083,37084,Henry V,25.0,1.2.260,First Ambassador,Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
37084,37085,Henry V,25.0,1.2.261,First Ambassador,Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
37085,37086,Henry V,26.0,1.2.262,KING HENRY V,"What treasure, uncle?"
37086,37087,Henry V,27.0,1.2.263,EXETER,"Tennis-balls, my liege."
37087,37088,Henry V,28.0,1.2.264,KING HENRY V,"We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us,"
37088,37089,Henry V,28.0,1.2.265,KING HENRY V,His present and your pains we thank you for:
37089,37090,Henry V,28.0,1.2.266,KING HENRY V,"When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,"
37090,37091,Henry V,28.0,1.2.267,KING HENRY V,"We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set"
37091,37092,Henry V,28.0,1.2.268,KING HENRY V,Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
37092,37093,Henry V,28.0,1.2.269,KING HENRY V,Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
37093,37094,Henry V,28.0,1.2.270,KING HENRY V,That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
37094,37095,Henry V,28.0,1.2.271,KING HENRY V,"With chaces. And we understand him well,"
37095,37096,Henry V,28.0,1.2.272,KING HENRY V,"How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,"
37096,37097,Henry V,28.0,1.2.273,KING HENRY V,Not measuring what use we made of them.
37097,37098,Henry V,28.0,1.2.274,KING HENRY V,"We never valued this poor seat of England,"
37098,37099,Henry V,28.0,1.2.275,KING HENRY V,"And therefore, living hence, did give ourself"
37099,37100,Henry V,28.0,1.2.276,KING HENRY V,"To barbarous licence, as 'tis ever common"
37100,37101,Henry V,28.0,1.2.277,KING HENRY V,That men are merriest when they are from home.
37101,37102,Henry V,28.0,1.2.278,KING HENRY V,"But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,"
37102,37103,Henry V,28.0,1.2.279,KING HENRY V,Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
37103,37104,Henry V,28.0,1.2.280,KING HENRY V,When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
37104,37105,Henry V,28.0,1.2.281,KING HENRY V,For that I have laid by my majesty
37105,37106,Henry V,28.0,1.2.282,KING HENRY V,"And plodded like a man for working-days,"
37106,37107,Henry V,28.0,1.2.283,KING HENRY V,But I will rise there with so full a glory
37107,37108,Henry V,28.0,1.2.284,KING HENRY V,"That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,"
37108,37109,Henry V,28.0,1.2.285,KING HENRY V,"Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us."
37109,37110,Henry V,28.0,1.2.286,KING HENRY V,And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
37110,37111,Henry V,28.0,1.2.287,KING HENRY V,"Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones, and his soul"
37111,37112,Henry V,28.0,1.2.288,KING HENRY V,Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
37112,37113,Henry V,28.0,1.2.289,KING HENRY V,That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
37113,37114,Henry V,28.0,1.2.290,KING HENRY V,"Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands,"
37114,37115,Henry V,28.0,1.2.291,KING HENRY V,"Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down,"
37115,37116,Henry V,28.0,1.2.292,KING HENRY V,And some are yet ungotten and unborn
37116,37117,Henry V,28.0,1.2.293,KING HENRY V,That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
37117,37118,Henry V,28.0,1.2.294,KING HENRY V,"But this lies all within the will of God,"
37118,37119,Henry V,28.0,1.2.295,KING HENRY V,"To whom I do appeal, and in whose name"
37119,37120,Henry V,28.0,1.2.296,KING HENRY V,"Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,"
37120,37121,Henry V,28.0,1.2.297,KING HENRY V,To venge me as I may and to put forth
37121,37122,Henry V,28.0,1.2.298,KING HENRY V,My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
37122,37123,Henry V,28.0,1.2.299,KING HENRY V,"So get you hence in peace, and tell the Dauphin"
37123,37124,Henry V,28.0,1.2.300,KING HENRY V,"His jest will savour but of shallow wit,"
37124,37125,Henry V,28.0,1.2.301,KING HENRY V,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
37125,37126,Henry V,28.0,1.2.302,KING HENRY V,Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
37126,37127,Henry V,28.0,,KING HENRY V,Exeunt Ambassadors
37127,37128,Henry V,29.0,1.2.303,EXETER,This was a merry message.
37128,37129,Henry V,30.0,1.2.304,KING HENRY V,We hope to make the sender blush at it.
37129,37130,Henry V,30.0,1.2.305,KING HENRY V,"Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour"
37130,37131,Henry V,30.0,1.2.306,KING HENRY V,"That may give furtherance to our expedition,"
37131,37132,Henry V,30.0,1.2.307,KING HENRY V,"For we have now no thought in us but France,"
37132,37133,Henry V,30.0,1.2.308,KING HENRY V,"Save those to God, that run before our business."
37133,37134,Henry V,30.0,1.2.309,KING HENRY V,Therefore let our proportions for these wars
37134,37135,Henry V,30.0,1.2.310,KING HENRY V,Be soon collected and all things thought upon
37135,37136,Henry V,30.0,1.2.311,KING HENRY V,That may with reasonable swiftness add
37136,37137,Henry V,30.0,1.2.312,KING HENRY V,"More feathers to our wings, for, God before,"
37137,37138,Henry V,30.0,1.2.313,KING HENRY V,We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
37138,37139,Henry V,30.0,1.2.314,KING HENRY V,"Therefore let every man now task his thought,"
37139,37140,Henry V,30.0,1.2.315,KING HENRY V,That this fair action may on foot be brought.

37164,37165,Henry V,1.0,2.0.21,Chorus,"A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills"

37190,37191,Henry V,2.0,2.1.2,NYM,"Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph."
37191,37192,Henry V,3.0,2.1.3,BARDOLPH,"What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?"
37192,37193,Henry V,4.0,2.1.4,NYM,"For my part, I care not: I say little, but when"
37193,37194,Henry V,4.0,2.1.5,NYM,"time shall serve, there shall be smiles, but that"
37194,37195,Henry V,4.0,2.1.6,NYM,"shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will"
37195,37196,Henry V,4.0,2.1.7,NYM,"wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one, but"
37196,37197,Henry V,4.0,2.1.8,NYM,"what though? it will toast cheese, and it will"
37197,37198,Henry V,4.0,2.1.9,NYM,endure cold as another man's sword will: and
37198,37199,Henry V,4.0,2.1.10,NYM,there's an end.
37199,37200,Henry V,5.0,2.1.11,BARDOLPH,"I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends, and"
37200,37201,Henry V,5.0,2.1.12,BARDOLPH,we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
37201,37202,Henry V,5.0,2.1.13,BARDOLPH,"be so, good Corporal Nym."
37202,37203,Henry V,6.0,2.1.14,NYM,"Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the"
37203,37204,Henry V,6.0,2.1.15,NYM,"certain of it, and when I cannot live any longer, I"
37204,37205,Henry V,6.0,2.1.16,NYM,"will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the"
37205,37206,Henry V,6.0,2.1.17,NYM,rendezvous of it.
37206,37207,Henry V,7.0,2.1.18,BARDOLPH,"It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell"
37207,37208,Henry V,7.0,2.1.19,BARDOLPH,"Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong, for you"
37208,37209,Henry V,7.0,2.1.20,BARDOLPH,were troth-plight to her.
37209,37210,Henry V,8.0,2.1.21,NYM,I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
37210,37211,Henry V,8.0,2.1.22,NYM,"sleep, and they may have their throats about them at"
37211,37212,Henry V,8.0,2.1.23,NYM,"that time, and some say knives have edges. It must"
37212,37213,Henry V,8.0,2.1.24,NYM,"be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet"
37213,37214,Henry V,8.0,2.1.25,NYM,"she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I"
37214,37215,Henry V,8.0,2.1.26,NYM,cannot tell.
37215,37216,Henry V,8.0,,NYM,Enter PISTOL and Hostess
37216,37217,Henry V,9.0,2.1.27,BARDOLPH,Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good

37218,37219,Henry V,10.0,2.1.29,PISTOL,"Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,"
37219,37220,Henry V,10.0,2.1.30,PISTOL,"I swear, I scorn the term, Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers."
37220,37221,Henry V,11.0,2.1.31,Hostess,"No, by my troth, not long, for we cannot lodge and"
37221,37222,Henry V,11.0,2.1.32,Hostess,board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
37222,37223,Henry V,11.0,2.1.33,Hostess,"honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will"
37223,37224,Henry V,11.0,2.1.34,Hostess,be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
37224,37225,Henry V,11.0,,Hostess,NYM and PISTOL draw

37226,37227,Henry V,11.0,2.1.36,Hostess,shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
37227,37228,Henry V,12.0,2.1.37,BARDOLPH,Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.
37228,37229,Henry V,13.0,2.1.38,NYM,Pish!
37229,37230,Henry V,14.0,2.1.39,PISTOL,"Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!"
37230,37231,Henry V,15.0,2.1.40,Hostess,"Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword."
37231,37232,Henry V,16.0,2.1.41,NYM,Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
37232,37233,Henry V,17.0,2.1.42,PISTOL,"'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!"
37233,37234,Henry V,17.0,2.1.43,PISTOL,"The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face,"

37602,37603,Henry V,2.0,2.4.24,DAUPHIN,"And let us do it with no show of fear,"
37603,37604,Henry V,2.0,2.4.25,DAUPHIN,"No, with no more than if we heard that England"
37604,37605,Henry V,2.0,2.4.26,DAUPHIN,Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
37605,37606,Henry V,2.0,2.4.27,DAUPHIN,"For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,"
37606,37607,Henry V,2.0,2.4.28,DAUPHIN,Her sceptre so fantastically borne
37607,37608,Henry V,2.0,2.4.29,DAUPHIN,"By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,"
37608,37609,Henry V,2.0,2.4.30,DAUPHIN,That fear attends her not.
37609,37610,Henry V,3.0,2.4.31,Constable,"O peace, Prince Dauphin!"
37610,37611,Henry V,3.0,2.4.32,Constable,You are too much mistaken in this king:
37611,37612,Henry V,3.0,2.4.33,Constable,"Question your grace the late ambassadors,"
37612,37613,Henry V,3.0,2.4.34,Constable,"With what great state he heard their embassy,"
37613,37614,Henry V,3.0,2.4.35,Constable,"How well supplied with noble counsellors,"
37614,37615,Henry V,3.0,2.4.36,Constable,"How modest in exception, and withal"
37615,37616,Henry V,3.0,2.4.37,Constable,"How terrible in constant resolution,"
37616,37617,Henry V,3.0,2.4.38,Constable,And you shall find his vanities forespent
37617,37618,Henry V,3.0,2.4.39,Constable,"Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,"
37618,37619,Henry V,3.0,2.4.40,Constable,"Covering discretion with a coat of folly,"
37619,37620,Henry V,3.0,2.4.41,Constable,As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
37620,37621,Henry V,3.0,2.4.42,Constable,That shall first spring and be most delicate.
37621,37622,Henry V,4.0,2.4.43,DAUPHIN,"Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable,"
37622,37623,Henry V,4.0,2.4.44,DAUPHIN,"But though we think it so, it is no matter:"
37623,37624,Henry V,4.0,2.4.45,DAUPHIN,In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
37624,37625,Henry V,4.0,2.4.46,DAUPHIN,The enemy more mighty than he seems:
37625,37626,Henry V,4.0,2.4.47,DAUPHIN,"So the proportions of defence are fill'd,"
37626,37627,Henry V,4.0,2.4.48,DAUPHIN,Which of a weak or niggardly projection
37627,37628,Henry V,4.0,2.4.49,DAUPHIN,"Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting"
37628,37629,Henry V,4.0,2.4.50,DAUPHIN,A little cloth.
37629,37630,Henry V,5.0,2.4.51,KING OF FRANCE,"Think we King Harry strong,"
37630,37631,Henry V,5.0,2.4.52,KING OF FRANCE,"And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him."
37631,37632,Henry V,5.0,2.4.53,KING OF FRANCE,"The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us,"
37632,37633,Henry V,5.0,2.4.54,KING OF FRANCE,And he is bred out of that bloody strain
37633,37634,Henry V,5.0,2.4.55,KING OF FRANCE,That haunted us in our familiar paths:
37634,37635,Henry V,5.0,2.4.56,KING OF FRANCE,Witness our too much memorable shame
37635,37636,Henry V,5.0,2.4.57,KING OF FRANCE,"When Cressy battle fatally was struck,"
37636,37637,Henry V,5.0,2.4.58,KING OF FRANCE,And all our princes captiv'd by the hand
37637,37638,Henry V,5.0,2.4.59,KING OF FRANCE,"Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales,"
37638,37639,Henry V,5.0,2.4.60,KING OF FRANCE,"Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,"
37639,37640,Henry V,5.0,2.4.61,KING OF FRANCE,"Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,"
37640,37641,Henry V,5.0,2.4.62,KING OF FRANCE,"Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,"
37641,37642,Henry V,5.0,2.4.63,KING OF FRANCE,Mangle the work of nature and deface
37642,37643,Henry V,5.0,2.4.64,KING OF FRANCE,The patterns that by God and by French fathers
37643,37644,Henry V,5.0,2.4.65,KING OF FRANCE,Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
37644,37645,Henry V,5.0,2.4.66,KING OF FRANCE,"Of that victorious stock, and let us fear"
37645,37646,Henry V,5.0,2.4.67,KING OF FRANCE,The native mightiness and fate of him.
37646,37647,Henry V,5.0,,KING OF FRANCE,Enter a Messenger
37647,37648,Henry V,6.0,2.4.68,Messenger,Ambassadors from Harry King of England
37648,37649,Henry V,6.0,2.4.69,Messenger,Do crave admittance to your majesty.
37649,37650,Henry V,7.0,2.4.70,KING OF FRANCE,"We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them."
37650,37651,Henry V,7.0,,KING OF FRANCE,Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords
37651,37652,Henry V,7.0,2.4.71,KING OF FRANCE,"You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends."
37652,37653,Henry V,8.0,2.4.72,DAUPHIN,"Turn head, and stop pursuit, for coward dogs"
37653,37654,Henry V,8.0,2.4.73,DAUPHIN,Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
37654,37655,Henry V,8.0,2.4.74,DAUPHIN,"Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,"
37655,37656,Henry V,8.0,2.4.75,DAUPHIN,"Take up the English short, and let them know"
37656,37657,Henry V,8.0,2.4.76,DAUPHIN,Of what a monarchy you are the head:
37657,37658,Henry V,8.0,2.4.77,DAUPHIN,"Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin"
37658,37659,Henry V,8.0,2.4.78,DAUPHIN,As self-neglecting.
37659,37660,Henry V,8.0,,DAUPHIN,"Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train"
37660,37661,Henry V,9.0,2.4.79,KING OF FRANCE,From our brother England?
37661,37662,Henry V,10.0,2.4.80,EXETER,"From him, and thus he greets your majesty."
37662,37663,Henry V,10.0,2.4.81,EXETER,"He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,"
37663,37664,Henry V,10.0,2.4.82,EXETER,"That you divest yourself, and lay apart"
37664,37665,Henry V,10.0,2.4.83,EXETER,"The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,"
37665,37666,Henry V,10.0,2.4.84,EXETER,"By law of nature and of nations, 'long"
37666,37667,Henry V,10.0,2.4.85,EXETER,"To him and to his heirs, namely, the crown"
37667,37668,Henry V,10.0,2.4.86,EXETER,And all wide-stretched honours that pertain

37669,37670,Henry V,10.0,2.4.88,EXETER,Unto the crown of France. That you may know
37670,37671,Henry V,10.0,2.4.89,EXETER,"'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,"
37671,37672,Henry V,10.0,2.4.90,EXETER,"Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,"
37672,37673,Henry V,10.0,2.4.91,EXETER,"Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,"
37673,37674,Henry V,10.0,2.4.92,EXETER,"He sends you this most memorable line,"
37674,37675,Henry V,10.0,2.4.93,EXETER,"In every branch truly demonstrative,"
37675,37676,Henry V,10.0,2.4.94,EXETER,Willing to overlook this pedigree:
37676,37677,Henry V,10.0,2.4.95,EXETER,And when you find him evenly derived
37677,37678,Henry V,10.0,2.4.96,EXETER,"From his most famed of famous ancestors,"
37678,37679,Henry V,10.0,2.4.97,EXETER,"Edward the Third, he bids you then resign"
37679,37680,Henry V,10.0,2.4.98,EXETER,"Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held"
37680,37681,Henry V,10.0,2.4.99,EXETER,From him the native and true challenger.
37681,37682,Henry V,11.0,2.4.100,KING OF FRANCE,Or else what follows?
37682,37683,Henry V,12.0,2.4.101,EXETER,"Bloody constraint, for if you hide the crown"
37683,37684,Henry V,12.0,2.4.102,EXETER,"Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:"
37684,37685,Henry V,12.0,2.4.103,EXETER,"Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,"
37685,37686,Henry V,12.0,2.4.104,EXETER,"In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,"
37686,37687,Henry V,12.0,2.4.105,EXETER,"That, if requiring fail, he will compel,"
37687,37688,Henry V,12.0,2.4.106,EXETER,"And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,"
37688,37689,Henry V,12.0,2.4.107,EXETER,"Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy"
37689,37690,Henry V,12.0,2.4.108,EXETER,On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
37690,37691,Henry V,12.0,2.4.109,EXETER,"Opens his vasty jaws, and on your head"
37691,37692,Henry V,12.0,2.4.110,EXETER,"Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries"
37692,37693,Henry V,12.0,2.4.111,EXETER,"The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,"
37693,37694,Henry V,12.0,2.4.112,EXETER,"For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,"
37694,37695,Henry V,12.0,2.4.113,EXETER,That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
37695,37696,Henry V,12.0,2.4.114,EXETER,"This is his claim, his threatening and my message,"
37696,37697,Henry V,12.0,2.4.115,EXETER,"Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,"
37697,37698,Henry V,12.0,2.4.116,EXETER,To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
37698,37699,Henry V,13.0,2.4.117,KING OF FRANCE,"For us, we will consider of this further:"
37699,37700,Henry V,13.0,2.4.118,KING OF FRANCE,To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
37700,37701,Henry V,13.0,2.4.119,KING OF FRANCE,Back to our brother England.
37701,37702,Henry V,14.0,2.4.120,DAUPHIN,"For the Dauphin,"
37702,37703,Henry V,14.0,2.4.121,DAUPHIN,I stand here for him: what to him from England?
37703,37704,Henry V,15.0,2.4.122,EXETER,"Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,"
37704,37705,Henry V,15.0,2.4.123,EXETER,And any thing that may not misbecome
37705,37706,Henry V,15.0,2.4.124,EXETER,"The mighty sender, doth he prize you at."
37706,37707,Henry V,15.0,2.4.125,EXETER,"Thus says my king, an' if your father's highness"
37707,37708,Henry V,15.0,2.4.126,EXETER,"Do not, in grant of all demands at large,"
37708,37709,Henry V,15.0,2.4.127,EXETER,"Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,"
37709,37710,Henry V,15.0,2.4.128,EXETER,"He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,"
37710,37711,Henry V,15.0,2.4.129,EXETER,That caves and womby vaultages of France
37711,37712,Henry V,15.0,2.4.130,EXETER,Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
37712,37713,Henry V,15.0,2.4.131,EXETER,In second accent of his ordnance.
37713,37714,Henry V,16.0,2.4.132,DAUPHIN,"Say, if my father render fair return,"
37714,37715,Henry V,16.0,2.4.133,DAUPHIN,"It is against my will, for I desire"
37715,37716,Henry V,16.0,2.4.134,DAUPHIN,"Nothing but odds with England: to that end,"
37716,37717,Henry V,16.0,2.4.135,DAUPHIN,"As matching to his youth and vanity,"
37717,37718,Henry V,16.0,2.4.136,DAUPHIN,I did present him with the Paris balls.
37718,37719,Henry V,17.0,2.4.137,EXETER,"He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,"
37719,37720,Henry V,17.0,2.4.138,EXETER,Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
37720,37721,Henry V,17.0,2.4.139,EXETER,"And, be assured, you'll find a difference,"
37721,37722,Henry V,17.0,2.4.140,EXETER,"As we his subjects have in wonder found,"
37722,37723,Henry V,17.0,2.4.141,EXETER,Between the promise of his greener days
37723,37724,Henry V,17.0,2.4.142,EXETER,And these he masters now: now he weighs time
37724,37725,Henry V,17.0,2.4.143,EXETER,Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
37725,37726,Henry V,17.0,2.4.144,EXETER,"In your own losses, if he stay in France."
37726,37727,Henry V,18.0,2.4.145,KING OF FRANCE,To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
37727,37728,Henry V,19.0,2.4.146,EXETER,"Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king"
37728,37729,Henry V,19.0,2.4.147,EXETER,"Come here himself to question our delay,"
37729,37730,Henry V,19.0,2.4.148,EXETER,For he is footed in this land already.
37730,37731,Henry V,20.0,2.4.149,KING OF FRANCE,You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:
37731,37732,Henry V,20.0,2.4.150,KING OF FRANCE,A night is but small breath and little pause
37732,37733,Henry V,20.0,2.4.151,KING OF FRANCE,To answer matters of this consequence.

37739,37740,Henry V,1.0,3.0.3,Chorus,Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen

37767,37768,Henry V,1.0,3.0.31,Chorus,Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
37768,37769,Henry V,1.0,3.0.32,Chorus,The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner

37779,37780,Henry V,1.0,3.1.4,KING HENRY V,As modest stillness and humility:

37845,37846,Henry V,10.0,3.2.30,Boy,"red-faced, by the means whereof a' faces it out, but"
37846,37847,Henry V,10.0,3.2.31,Boy,"fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue"

37848,37849,Henry V,10.0,3.2.33,Boy,"words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath"
37849,37850,Henry V,10.0,3.2.34,Boy,"heard that men of few words are the best men, and"
37850,37851,Henry V,10.0,3.2.35,Boy,"therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'"
37851,37852,Henry V,10.0,3.2.36,Boy,should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
37852,37853,Henry V,10.0,3.2.37,Boy,"are matched with as few good deeds, for a' never"
37853,37854,Henry V,10.0,3.2.38,Boy,"broke any man's head but his own, and that was"
37854,37855,Henry V,10.0,3.2.39,Boy,against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
37855,37856,Henry V,10.0,3.2.40,Boy,"any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a"
37856,37857,Henry V,10.0,3.2.41,Boy,"lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for"
37857,37858,Henry V,10.0,3.2.42,Boy,three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
37858,37859,Henry V,10.0,3.2.43,Boy,"brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a"

37863,37864,Henry V,10.0,3.2.48,Boy,if I should take from another's pocket to put into
37864,37865,Henry V,10.0,3.2.49,Boy,"mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I"
37865,37866,Henry V,10.0,3.2.50,Boy,"must leave them, and seek some better service:"
37866,37867,Henry V,10.0,3.2.51,Boy,"their villany goes against my weak stomach, and"
37867,37868,Henry V,10.0,3.2.52,Boy,therefore I must cast it up.

38639,38640,Henry V,47.0,4.1.99,KING HENRY V,"No, nor it is not meet he should. For, though I"
38640,38641,Henry V,47.0,4.1.100,KING HENRY V,"speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I"
38641,38642,Henry V,47.0,4.1.101,KING HENRY V,am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the

38643,38644,Henry V,47.0,4.1.103,KING HENRY V,senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies

38648,38649,Henry V,47.0,4.1.108,KING HENRY V,"do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish"
38649,38650,Henry V,47.0,4.1.109,KING HENRY V,"as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess"
38650,38651,Henry V,47.0,4.1.110,KING HENRY V,"him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing"
38651,38652,Henry V,47.0,4.1.111,KING HENRY V,"it, should dishearten his army."
38652,38653,Henry V,48.0,4.1.112,BATES,"He may show what outward courage he will, but I"
38653,38654,Henry V,48.0,4.1.113,BATES,"believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish"

38666,38667,Henry V,52.0,4.1.126,WILLIAMS,That's more than we know.
38667,38668,Henry V,53.0,4.1.127,BATES,"Ay, or more than we should seek after, for we know"
38668,38669,Henry V,53.0,4.1.128,BATES,"enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if"
38669,38670,Henry V,53.0,4.1.129,BATES,"his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes"
38670,38671,Henry V,53.0,4.1.130,BATES,the crime of it out of us.
38671,38672,Henry V,54.0,4.1.131,WILLIAMS,"But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath"
38672,38673,Henry V,54.0,4.1.132,WILLIAMS,"a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and"

38678,38679,Henry V,54.0,4.1.138,WILLIAMS,children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die

38680,38681,Henry V,54.0,4.1.140,WILLIAMS,"charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their"
38681,38682,Henry V,54.0,4.1.141,WILLIAMS,"argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it"
38682,38683,Henry V,54.0,4.1.142,WILLIAMS,will be a black matter for the king that led them to

38706,38707,Henry V,55.0,4.1.166,KING HENRY V,"defeated the law and outrun native punishment,"
38707,38708,Henry V,55.0,4.1.167,KING HENRY V,"though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to"
38708,38709,Henry V,55.0,4.1.168,KING HENRY V,"fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance,"
38709,38710,Henry V,55.0,4.1.169,KING HENRY V,so that here men are punished for before-breach of
38710,38711,Henry V,55.0,4.1.170,KING HENRY V,the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
38711,38712,Henry V,55.0,4.1.171,KING HENRY V,"they feared the death, they have borne life away,"
38712,38713,Henry V,55.0,4.1.172,KING HENRY V,"and where they would be safe, they perish: then if"
38713,38714,Henry V,55.0,4.1.173,KING HENRY V,"they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of"
38714,38715,Henry V,55.0,4.1.174,KING HENRY V,their damnation than he was before guilty of those
38715,38716,Henry V,55.0,4.1.175,KING HENRY V,impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
38716,38717,Henry V,55.0,4.1.176,KING HENRY V,"subject's duty is the king's, but every subject's"
38717,38718,Henry V,55.0,4.1.177,KING HENRY V,soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
38718,38719,Henry V,55.0,4.1.178,KING HENRY V,"the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every"
38719,38720,Henry V,55.0,4.1.179,KING HENRY V,"mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death"
38720,38721,Henry V,55.0,4.1.180,KING HENRY V,"is to him advantage, or not dying, the time was"
38721,38722,Henry V,55.0,4.1.181,KING HENRY V,blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
38722,38723,Henry V,55.0,4.1.182,KING HENRY V,"and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think"
38723,38724,Henry V,55.0,4.1.183,KING HENRY V,"that, making God so free an offer, He let him"
38724,38725,Henry V,55.0,4.1.184,KING HENRY V,outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
38725,38726,Henry V,55.0,4.1.185,KING HENRY V,others how they should prepare.
38726,38727,Henry V,56.0,4.1.186,WILLIAMS,"'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon"
38727,38728,Henry V,56.0,4.1.187,WILLIAMS,"his own head, the king is not to answer it."
38728,38729,Henry V,57.0,4.1.188,BATES,"But I do not desire he should answer for me, and"
38729,38730,Henry V,57.0,4.1.189,BATES,yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
38730,38731,Henry V,58.0,4.1.190,KING HENRY V,I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
38731,38732,Henry V,59.0,4.1.191,WILLIAMS,"Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but"
38732,38733,Henry V,59.0,4.1.192,WILLIAMS,"when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we"
38733,38734,Henry V,59.0,4.1.193,WILLIAMS,ne'er the wiser.
38734,38735,Henry V,60.0,4.1.194,KING HENRY V,"If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after."
38735,38736,Henry V,61.0,4.1.195,WILLIAMS,You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
38736,38737,Henry V,61.0,4.1.196,WILLIAMS,"elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can"
38737,38738,Henry V,61.0,4.1.197,WILLIAMS,do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
38738,38739,Henry V,61.0,4.1.198,WILLIAMS,turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
38739,38740,Henry V,61.0,4.1.199,WILLIAMS,peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
38740,38741,Henry V,61.0,4.1.200,WILLIAMS,"after! come, 'tis a foolish saying."
38741,38742,Henry V,62.0,4.1.201,KING HENRY V,Your reproof is something too round: I should be
38742,38743,Henry V,62.0,4.1.202,KING HENRY V,"angry with you, if the time were convenient."
38743,38744,Henry V,63.0,4.1.203,WILLIAMS,"Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live."
38744,38745,Henry V,64.0,4.1.204,KING HENRY V,I embrace it.
38745,38746,Henry V,65.0,4.1.205,WILLIAMS,How shall I know thee again?
38746,38747,Henry V,66.0,4.1.206,KING HENRY V,"Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my"
38747,38748,Henry V,66.0,4.1.207,KING HENRY V,"bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I"
38748,38749,Henry V,66.0,4.1.208,KING HENRY V,will make it my quarrel.
38749,38750,Henry V,67.0,4.1.209,WILLIAMS,Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
38750,38751,Henry V,68.0,4.1.210,KING HENRY V,There.
38751,38752,Henry V,69.0,4.1.211,WILLIAMS,This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come
38752,38753,Henry V,69.0,4.1.212,WILLIAMS,"to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'"
38753,38754,Henry V,69.0,4.1.213,WILLIAMS,"by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear."
38754,38755,Henry V,70.0,4.1.214,KING HENRY V,"If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it."
38755,38756,Henry V,71.0,4.1.215,WILLIAMS,Thou darest as well be hanged.
38756,38757,Henry V,72.0,4.1.216,KING HENRY V,"Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the"

38758,38759,Henry V,73.0,4.1.218,WILLIAMS,Keep thy word: fare thee well.

38760,38761,Henry V,74.0,4.1.220,BATES,"French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon."
38761,38762,Henry V,75.0,4.1.221,KING HENRY V,"Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to"
38762,38763,Henry V,75.0,4.1.222,KING HENRY V,"one, they will beat us, for they bear them on their"
38763,38764,Henry V,75.0,4.1.223,KING HENRY V,shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut
38764,38765,Henry V,75.0,4.1.224,KING HENRY V,"French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will"
38765,38766,Henry V,75.0,4.1.225,KING HENRY V,be a clipper.

38784,38785,Henry V,75.0,4.1.243,KING HENRY V,Creating awe and fear in other men?

38886,38887,Henry V,11.0,4.2.30,Constable,Though we upon this mountain's basis by
38887,38888,Henry V,11.0,4.2.31,Constable,Took stand for idle speculation:
38888,38889,Henry V,11.0,4.2.32,Constable,But that our honours must not. What's to say?
38889,38890,Henry V,11.0,4.2.33,Constable,A very little little let us do.
38890,38891,Henry V,11.0,4.2.34,Constable,And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
38891,38892,Henry V,11.0,4.2.35,Constable,"The tucket sonance and the note to mount,"
38892,38893,Henry V,11.0,4.2.36,Constable,For our approach shall so much dare the field
38893,38894,Henry V,11.0,4.2.37,Constable,That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

38895,38896,Henry V,12.0,4.2.38,GRANDPRE,"Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?"
38896,38897,Henry V,12.0,4.2.39,GRANDPRE,"Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,"
38897,38898,Henry V,12.0,4.2.40,GRANDPRE,Ill-favouredly become the morning field:
38898,38899,Henry V,12.0,4.2.41,GRANDPRE,"Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,"
38899,38900,Henry V,12.0,4.2.42,GRANDPRE,And our air shakes them passing scornfully:
38900,38901,Henry V,12.0,4.2.43,GRANDPRE,Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
38901,38902,Henry V,12.0,4.2.44,GRANDPRE,And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
38902,38903,Henry V,12.0,4.2.45,GRANDPRE,"The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,"
38903,38904,Henry V,12.0,4.2.46,GRANDPRE,"With torch-staves in their hand, and their poor jades"
38904,38905,Henry V,12.0,4.2.47,GRANDPRE,"Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,"
38905,38906,Henry V,12.0,4.2.48,GRANDPRE,The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
38906,38907,Henry V,12.0,4.2.49,GRANDPRE,And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
38907,38908,Henry V,12.0,4.2.50,GRANDPRE,"Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless,"
38908,38909,Henry V,12.0,4.2.51,GRANDPRE,"And their executors, the knavish crows,"
38909,38910,Henry V,12.0,4.2.52,GRANDPRE,"Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour."
38910,38911,Henry V,12.0,4.2.53,GRANDPRE,Description cannot suit itself in words
38911,38912,Henry V,12.0,4.2.54,GRANDPRE,To demonstrate the life of such a battle
38912,38913,Henry V,12.0,4.2.55,GRANDPRE,In life so lifeless as it shows itself.
38913,38914,Henry V,13.0,4.2.56,Constable,"They have said their prayers, and they stay for death."
38914,38915,Henry V,14.0,4.2.57,DAUPHIN,Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
38915,38916,Henry V,14.0,4.2.58,DAUPHIN,"And give their fasting horses provender,"
38916,38917,Henry V,14.0,4.2.59,DAUPHIN,And after fight with them?

38920,38921,Henry V,15.0,4.2.63,Constable,"The sun is high, and we outwear the day."

38937,38938,Henry V,7.0,4.3.14,EXETER,For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.

38944,38945,Henry V,9.0,4.3.19,WESTMORELAND,That do no work to-day!
38945,38946,Henry V,10.0,4.3.20,KING HENRY V,What's he that wishes so?
38946,38947,Henry V,10.0,4.3.21,KING HENRY V,"My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:"
38947,38948,Henry V,10.0,4.3.22,KING HENRY V,"If we are mark'd to die, we are enow"
38948,38949,Henry V,10.0,4.3.23,KING HENRY V,"To do our country loss, and if to live,"
38949,38950,Henry V,10.0,4.3.24,KING HENRY V,"The fewer men, the greater share of honour."
38950,38951,Henry V,10.0,4.3.25,KING HENRY V,"God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more."
38951,38952,Henry V,10.0,4.3.26,KING HENRY V,"By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,"
38952,38953,Henry V,10.0,4.3.27,KING HENRY V,"Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost,"
38953,38954,Henry V,10.0,4.3.28,KING HENRY V,"It yearns me not if men my garments wear,"
38954,38955,Henry V,10.0,4.3.29,KING HENRY V,Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
38955,38956,Henry V,10.0,4.3.30,KING HENRY V,"But if it be a sin to covet honour,"
38956,38957,Henry V,10.0,4.3.31,KING HENRY V,I am the most offending soul alive.
38957,38958,Henry V,10.0,4.3.32,KING HENRY V,"No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:"
38958,38959,Henry V,10.0,4.3.33,KING HENRY V,God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
38959,38960,Henry V,10.0,4.3.34,KING HENRY V,"As one man more, methinks, would share from me"
38960,38961,Henry V,10.0,4.3.35,KING HENRY V,"For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!"
38961,38962,Henry V,10.0,4.3.36,KING HENRY V,"Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,"
38962,38963,Henry V,10.0,4.3.37,KING HENRY V,"That he which hath no stomach to this fight,"
38963,38964,Henry V,10.0,4.3.38,KING HENRY V,"Let him depart, his passport shall be made"
38964,38965,Henry V,10.0,4.3.39,KING HENRY V,And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
38965,38966,Henry V,10.0,4.3.40,KING HENRY V,We would not die in that man's company
38966,38967,Henry V,10.0,4.3.41,KING HENRY V,That fears his fellowship to die with us.
38967,38968,Henry V,10.0,4.3.42,KING HENRY V,This day is called the feast of Crispian:
38968,38969,Henry V,10.0,4.3.43,KING HENRY V,"He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,"
38969,38970,Henry V,10.0,4.3.44,KING HENRY V,"Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,"
38970,38971,Henry V,10.0,4.3.45,KING HENRY V,And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
38971,38972,Henry V,10.0,4.3.46,KING HENRY V,"He that shall live this day, and see old age,"
38972,38973,Henry V,10.0,4.3.47,KING HENRY V,"Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,"
38973,38974,Henry V,10.0,4.3.48,KING HENRY V,And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
38974,38975,Henry V,10.0,4.3.49,KING HENRY V,Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
38975,38976,Henry V,10.0,4.3.50,KING HENRY V,And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
38976,38977,Henry V,10.0,4.3.51,KING HENRY V,"Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,"
38977,38978,Henry V,10.0,4.3.52,KING HENRY V,But he'll remember with advantages
38978,38979,Henry V,10.0,4.3.53,KING HENRY V,What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
38979,38980,Henry V,10.0,4.3.54,KING HENRY V,Familiar in his mouth as household words
38980,38981,Henry V,10.0,4.3.55,KING HENRY V,"Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,"
38981,38982,Henry V,10.0,4.3.56,KING HENRY V,"Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,"
38982,38983,Henry V,10.0,4.3.57,KING HENRY V,Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
38983,38984,Henry V,10.0,4.3.58,KING HENRY V,"This story shall the good man teach his son,"
38984,38985,Henry V,10.0,4.3.59,KING HENRY V,"And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,"
38985,38986,Henry V,10.0,4.3.60,KING HENRY V,"From this day to the ending of the world,"
38986,38987,Henry V,10.0,4.3.61,KING HENRY V,"But we in it shall be remember'd,"
38987,38988,Henry V,10.0,4.3.62,KING HENRY V,"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,"
38988,38989,Henry V,10.0,4.3.63,KING HENRY V,For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
38989,38990,Henry V,10.0,4.3.64,KING HENRY V,"Shall be my brother, be he ne'er so vile,"
38990,38991,Henry V,10.0,4.3.65,KING HENRY V,This day shall gentle his condition:
38991,38992,Henry V,10.0,4.3.66,KING HENRY V,And gentlemen in England now a-bed
38992,38993,Henry V,10.0,4.3.67,KING HENRY V,"Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,"
38993,38994,Henry V,10.0,4.3.68,KING HENRY V,And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
38994,38995,Henry V,10.0,4.3.69,KING HENRY V,That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
38995,38996,Henry V,10.0,,KING HENRY V,Re-enter SALISBURY
38996,38997,Henry V,11.0,4.3.70,SALISBURY,"My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:"

38998,38999,Henry V,11.0,4.3.72,SALISBURY,And will with all expedience charge on us.
38999,39000,Henry V,12.0,4.3.73,KING HENRY V,"All things are ready, if our minds be so."
39000,39001,Henry V,13.0,4.3.74,WESTMORELAND,Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
39001,39002,Henry V,14.0,4.3.75,KING HENRY V,"Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?"
39002,39003,Henry V,15.0,4.3.76,WESTMORELAND,"God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,"
39003,39004,Henry V,15.0,4.3.77,WESTMORELAND,"Without more help, could fight this royal battle!"
39004,39005,Henry V,16.0,4.3.78,KING HENRY V,"Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men,"
39005,39006,Henry V,16.0,4.3.79,KING HENRY V,Which likes me better than to wish us one.
39006,39007,Henry V,16.0,4.3.80,KING HENRY V,You know your places: God be with you all!
39007,39008,Henry V,16.0,,KING HENRY V,Tucket. Enter MONTJOY

39010,39011,Henry V,17.0,4.3.83,MONTJOY,Before thy most assured overthrow:
39011,39012,Henry V,17.0,4.3.84,MONTJOY,"For certainly thou art so near the gulf,"
39012,39013,Henry V,17.0,4.3.85,MONTJOY,"Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,"
39013,39014,Henry V,17.0,4.3.86,MONTJOY,The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
39014,39015,Henry V,17.0,4.3.87,MONTJOY,"Thy followers of repentance, that their souls"

39021,39022,Henry V,20.0,4.3.94,KING HENRY V,Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
39022,39023,Henry V,20.0,4.3.95,KING HENRY V,Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?

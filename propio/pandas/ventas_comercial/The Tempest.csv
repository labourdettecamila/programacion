91401,91402,The Tempest,93.0,,LUCENTIO,SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise
91402,91403,The Tempest,93.0,1.1.1,LUCENTIO,of thunder and lightning heard.

91406,91407,The Tempest,3.0,1.1.4,Master,"Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,"
91407,91408,The Tempest,3.0,1.1.5,Master,"or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir."

91412,91413,The Tempest,4.0,1.1.8,Boatswain,"master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,"
91413,91414,The Tempest,4.0,1.1.9,Boatswain,if room enough!
91414,91415,The Tempest,4.0,,Boatswain,"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others"

91417,91418,The Tempest,6.0,1.1.12,Boatswain,"I pray now, keep below."
91418,91419,The Tempest,7.0,1.1.13,ANTONIO,"Where is the master, boatswain?"
91419,91420,The Tempest,8.0,1.1.14,Boatswain,Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
91420,91421,The Tempest,8.0,1.1.15,Boatswain,cabins: you do assist the storm.
91421,91422,The Tempest,9.0,1.1.16,GONZALO,"Nay, good, be patient."
91422,91423,The Tempest,10.0,1.1.17,Boatswain,When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
91423,91424,The Tempest,10.0,1.1.18,Boatswain,for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
91424,91425,The Tempest,11.0,1.1.19,GONZALO,"Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard."
91425,91426,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.20,Boatswain,None that I more love than myself. You are a
91426,91427,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.21,Boatswain,"counsellor, if you can command these elements to"
91427,91428,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.22,Boatswain,"silence, and work the peace of the present, we will"
91428,91429,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.23,Boatswain,"not hand a rope more, use your authority: if you"
91429,91430,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.24,Boatswain,"cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make"
91430,91431,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.25,Boatswain,yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
91431,91432,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.26,Boatswain,"the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out"
91432,91433,The Tempest,12.0,1.1.27,Boatswain,"of our way, I say."
91433,91434,The Tempest,12.0,,Boatswain,Exit
91434,91435,The Tempest,13.0,1.1.28,GONZALO,I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
91435,91436,The Tempest,13.0,1.1.29,GONZALO,"hath no drowning mark upon him, his complexion is"
91436,91437,The Tempest,13.0,1.1.30,GONZALO,"perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his"
91437,91438,The Tempest,13.0,1.1.31,GONZALO,"hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,"
91438,91439,The Tempest,13.0,1.1.32,GONZALO,for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
91439,91440,The Tempest,13.0,1.1.33,GONZALO,"born to be hanged, our case is miserable."
91440,91441,The Tempest,13.0,,GONZALO,Exeunt

91443,91444,The Tempest,14.0,1.1.35,Boatswain,her to try with main-course.
91444,91445,The Tempest,14.0,,Boatswain,A cry within
91445,91446,The Tempest,14.0,1.1.36,Boatswain,A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
91446,91447,The Tempest,14.0,1.1.37,Boatswain,the weather or our office.
91447,91448,The Tempest,14.0,,Boatswain,"Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO"
91448,91449,The Tempest,14.0,1.1.38,Boatswain,Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
91449,91450,The Tempest,14.0,1.1.39,Boatswain,and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
91450,91451,The Tempest,15.0,1.1.40,SEBASTIAN,"A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,"
91451,91452,The Tempest,15.0,1.1.41,SEBASTIAN,incharitable dog!
91452,91453,The Tempest,16.0,1.1.42,Boatswain,Work you then.
91453,91454,The Tempest,17.0,1.1.43,ANTONIO,"Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!"
91454,91455,The Tempest,17.0,1.1.44,ANTONIO,We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
91455,91456,The Tempest,18.0,1.1.45,GONZALO,"I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were"
91456,91457,The Tempest,18.0,1.1.46,GONZALO,no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
91457,91458,The Tempest,18.0,1.1.47,GONZALO,unstanched wench.
91458,91459,The Tempest,19.0,1.1.48,Boatswain,"Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to"
91459,91460,The Tempest,19.0,1.1.49,Boatswain,"sea again, lay her off."
91460,91461,The Tempest,19.0,,Boatswain,Enter Mariners wet
91461,91462,The Tempest,20.0,1.1.50,Mariners,"All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!"
91462,91463,The Tempest,21.0,1.1.51,Boatswain,"What, must our mouths be cold?"
91463,91464,The Tempest,22.0,1.1.52,GONZALO,"The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,"
91464,91465,The Tempest,22.0,1.1.53,GONZALO,For our case is as theirs.
91465,91466,The Tempest,23.0,1.1.54,SEBASTIAN,I'm out of patience.
91466,91467,The Tempest,24.0,1.1.55,ANTONIO,We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
91467,91468,The Tempest,24.0,1.1.56,ANTONIO,This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
91468,91469,The Tempest,24.0,1.1.57,ANTONIO,The washing of ten tides!
91469,91470,The Tempest,25.0,1.1.58,GONZALO,"He'll be hang'd yet,"
91470,91471,The Tempest,25.0,1.1.59,GONZALO,Though every drop of water swear against it
91471,91472,The Tempest,25.0,1.1.60,GONZALO,And gape at widest to glut him.
91472,91473,The Tempest,25.0,1.1.60,GONZALO,"A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and  children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'"
91473,91474,The Tempest,26.0,1.1.61,ANTONIO,Let's all sink with the king.
91474,91475,The Tempest,27.0,1.1.62,SEBASTIAN,Let's take leave of him.

91476,91477,The Tempest,28.0,1.1.63,GONZALO,Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
91477,91478,The Tempest,28.0,1.1.64,GONZALO,"acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any"
91478,91479,The Tempest,28.0,1.1.65,GONZALO,thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
91479,91480,The Tempest,28.0,1.1.66,GONZALO,die a dry death.
91480,91481,The Tempest,28.0,,GONZALO,Exeunt

91482,91483,The Tempest,28.0,,GONZALO,Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
91483,91484,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.1,MIRANDA,"If by your art, my dearest father, you have"
91484,91485,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.2,MIRANDA,"Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them."
91485,91486,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.3,MIRANDA,"The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,"
91486,91487,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.4,MIRANDA,"But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,"
91487,91488,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.5,MIRANDA,"Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered"
91488,91489,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.6,MIRANDA,"With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,"
91489,91490,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.7,MIRANDA,"Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,"
91490,91491,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.8,MIRANDA,"Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock"
91491,91492,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.9,MIRANDA,"Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd."
91492,91493,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.10,MIRANDA,"Had I been any god of power, I would"
91493,91494,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.11,MIRANDA,Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
91494,91495,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.12,MIRANDA,It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
91495,91496,The Tempest,1.0,1.2.13,MIRANDA,The fraughting souls within her.
91496,91497,The Tempest,2.0,1.2.14,PROSPERO,Be collected:
91497,91498,The Tempest,2.0,1.2.15,PROSPERO,No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
91498,91499,The Tempest,2.0,1.2.16,PROSPERO,There's no harm done.
91499,91500,The Tempest,3.0,1.2.17,MIRANDA,"O, woe the day!"
91500,91501,The Tempest,4.0,1.2.18,PROSPERO,No harm.
91501,91502,The Tempest,4.0,1.2.19,PROSPERO,"I have done nothing but in care of thee,"
91502,91503,The Tempest,4.0,1.2.20,PROSPERO,"Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who"
91503,91504,The Tempest,4.0,1.2.21,PROSPERO,"Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing"
91504,91505,The Tempest,4.0,1.2.22,PROSPERO,"Of whence I am, nor that I am more better"
91505,91506,The Tempest,4.0,1.2.23,PROSPERO,"Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,"
91506,91507,The Tempest,4.0,1.2.24,PROSPERO,And thy no greater father.
91507,91508,The Tempest,5.0,1.2.25,MIRANDA,More to know
91508,91509,The Tempest,5.0,1.2.26,MIRANDA,Did never meddle with my thoughts.
91509,91510,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.27,PROSPERO,'Tis time
91510,91511,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.28,PROSPERO,"I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,"
91511,91512,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.29,PROSPERO,And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
91512,91513,The Tempest,6.0,,PROSPERO,Lays down his mantle
91513,91514,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.30,PROSPERO,"Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort."
91514,91515,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.31,PROSPERO,"The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd"
91515,91516,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.32,PROSPERO,"The very virtue of compassion in thee,"
91516,91517,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.33,PROSPERO,I have with such provision in mine art
91517,91518,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.34,PROSPERO,So safely ordered that there is no soul--
91518,91519,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.35,PROSPERO,"No, not so much perdition as an hair"
91519,91520,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.36,PROSPERO,Betid to any creature in the vessel
91520,91521,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.37,PROSPERO,"Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down,"
91521,91522,The Tempest,6.0,1.2.38,PROSPERO,For thou must now know farther.
91522,91523,The Tempest,7.0,1.2.39,MIRANDA,You have often
91523,91524,The Tempest,7.0,1.2.40,MIRANDA,"Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd"
91524,91525,The Tempest,7.0,1.2.41,MIRANDA,"And left me to a bootless inquisition,"
91525,91526,The Tempest,7.0,1.2.42,MIRANDA,Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
91526,91527,The Tempest,8.0,1.2.43,PROSPERO,"The hour's now come,"
91527,91528,The Tempest,8.0,1.2.44,PROSPERO,"The very minute bids thee ope thine ear,"
91528,91529,The Tempest,8.0,1.2.45,PROSPERO,Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
91529,91530,The Tempest,8.0,1.2.46,PROSPERO,A time before we came unto this cell?
91530,91531,The Tempest,8.0,1.2.47,PROSPERO,"I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not"
91531,91532,The Tempest,8.0,1.2.48,PROSPERO,Out three years old.
91532,91533,The Tempest,9.0,1.2.49,MIRANDA,"Certainly, sir, I can."
91533,91534,The Tempest,10.0,1.2.50,PROSPERO,By what? by any other house or person?
91534,91535,The Tempest,10.0,1.2.51,PROSPERO,Of any thing the image tell me that
91535,91536,The Tempest,10.0,1.2.52,PROSPERO,Hath kept with thy remembrance.
91536,91537,The Tempest,11.0,1.2.53,MIRANDA,'Tis far off
91537,91538,The Tempest,11.0,1.2.54,MIRANDA,And rather like a dream than an assurance
91538,91539,The Tempest,11.0,1.2.55,MIRANDA,That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
91539,91540,The Tempest,11.0,1.2.56,MIRANDA,Four or five women once that tended me?
91540,91541,The Tempest,12.0,1.2.57,PROSPERO,"Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it"
91541,91542,The Tempest,12.0,1.2.58,PROSPERO,That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
91542,91543,The Tempest,12.0,1.2.59,PROSPERO,In the dark backward and abysm of time?
91543,91544,The Tempest,12.0,1.2.60,PROSPERO,"If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,"
91544,91545,The Tempest,12.0,1.2.61,PROSPERO,How thou camest here thou mayst.
91545,91546,The Tempest,13.0,1.2.62,MIRANDA,But that I do not.
91546,91547,The Tempest,14.0,1.2.63,PROSPERO,"Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,"
91547,91548,The Tempest,14.0,1.2.64,PROSPERO,Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
91548,91549,The Tempest,14.0,1.2.65,PROSPERO,A prince of power.
91549,91550,The Tempest,15.0,1.2.66,MIRANDA,"Sir, are not you my father?"
91550,91551,The Tempest,16.0,1.2.67,PROSPERO,"Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and"
91551,91552,The Tempest,16.0,1.2.68,PROSPERO,"She said thou wast my daughter, and thy father"
91552,91553,The Tempest,16.0,1.2.69,PROSPERO,"Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir"
91553,91554,The Tempest,16.0,1.2.70,PROSPERO,And princess no worse issued.
91554,91555,The Tempest,17.0,1.2.71,MIRANDA,O the heavens!
91555,91556,The Tempest,17.0,1.2.72,MIRANDA,"What foul play had we, that we came from thence?"
91556,91557,The Tempest,17.0,1.2.73,MIRANDA,Or blessed was't we did?
91557,91558,The Tempest,18.0,1.2.74,PROSPERO,"Both, both, my girl:"
91558,91559,The Tempest,18.0,1.2.75,PROSPERO,"By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,"
91559,91560,The Tempest,18.0,1.2.76,PROSPERO,But blessedly holp hither.
91560,91561,The Tempest,19.0,1.2.77,MIRANDA,"O, my heart bleeds"
91561,91562,The Tempest,19.0,1.2.78,MIRANDA,"To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,"
91562,91563,The Tempest,19.0,1.2.79,MIRANDA,"Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther."
91563,91564,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.80,PROSPERO,"My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--"
91564,91565,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.81,PROSPERO,"I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should"
91565,91566,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.82,PROSPERO,Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
91566,91567,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.83,PROSPERO,Of all the world I loved and to him put
91567,91568,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.84,PROSPERO,"The manage of my state, as at that time"
91568,91569,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.85,PROSPERO,Through all the signories it was the first
91569,91570,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.86,PROSPERO,"And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed"
91570,91571,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.87,PROSPERO,"In dignity, and for the liberal arts"
91571,91572,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.88,PROSPERO,"Without a parallel, those being all my study,"
91572,91573,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.89,PROSPERO,The government I cast upon my brother
91573,91574,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.90,PROSPERO,"And to my state grew stranger, being transported"
91574,91575,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.91,PROSPERO,And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
91575,91576,The Tempest,20.0,1.2.92,PROSPERO,Dost thou attend me?
91576,91577,The Tempest,21.0,1.2.93,MIRANDA,"Sir, most heedfully."
91577,91578,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.94,PROSPERO,"Being once perfected how to grant suits,"
91578,91579,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.95,PROSPERO,"How to deny them, who to advance and who"
91579,91580,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.96,PROSPERO,"To trash for over-topping, new created"
91580,91581,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.97,PROSPERO,"The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,"
91581,91582,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.98,PROSPERO,"Or else new form'd 'em, having both the key"
91582,91583,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.99,PROSPERO,"Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state"
91583,91584,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.100,PROSPERO,"To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was"
91584,91585,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.101,PROSPERO,"The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,"
91585,91586,The Tempest,22.0,1.2.102,PROSPERO,And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
91586,91587,The Tempest,23.0,1.2.103,MIRANDA,"O, good sir, I do."
91587,91588,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.104,PROSPERO,"I pray thee, mark me."
91588,91589,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.105,PROSPERO,"I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated"
91589,91590,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.106,PROSPERO,To closeness and the bettering of my mind
91590,91591,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.107,PROSPERO,"With that which, but by being so retired,"
91591,91592,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.108,PROSPERO,"O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother"
91592,91593,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.109,PROSPERO,"Awaked an evil nature, and my trust,"
91593,91594,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.110,PROSPERO,"Like a good parent, did beget of him"
91594,91595,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.111,PROSPERO,A falsehood in its contrary as great
91595,91596,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.112,PROSPERO,"As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,"
91596,91597,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.113,PROSPERO,"A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,"
91597,91598,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.114,PROSPERO,"Not only with what my revenue yielded,"
91598,91599,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.115,PROSPERO,"But what my power might else exact, like one"
91599,91600,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.116,PROSPERO,"Who having into truth, by telling of it,"
91600,91601,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.117,PROSPERO,"Made such a sinner of his memory,"
91601,91602,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.118,PROSPERO,"To credit his own lie, he did believe"
91602,91603,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.119,PROSPERO,"He was indeed the duke, out o' the substitution"
91603,91604,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.120,PROSPERO,"And executing the outward face of royalty,"
91604,91605,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.121,PROSPERO,With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
91605,91606,The Tempest,24.0,1.2.122,PROSPERO,Dost thou hear?
91606,91607,The Tempest,25.0,1.2.123,MIRANDA,"Your tale, sir, would cure deafness."
91607,91608,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.124,PROSPERO,To have no screen between this part he play'd
91608,91609,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.125,PROSPERO,"And him he play'd it for, he needs will be"
91609,91610,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.126,PROSPERO,"Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library"
91610,91611,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.127,PROSPERO,Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
91611,91612,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.128,PROSPERO,"He thinks me now incapable, confederates--"
91612,91613,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.129,PROSPERO,So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
91613,91614,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.130,PROSPERO,"To give him annual tribute, do him homage,"
91614,91615,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.131,PROSPERO,Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
91615,91616,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.132,PROSPERO,"The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--"
91616,91617,The Tempest,26.0,1.2.133,PROSPERO,To most ignoble stooping.
91617,91618,The Tempest,27.0,1.2.134,MIRANDA,O the heavens!
91618,91619,The Tempest,28.0,1.2.135,PROSPERO,"Mark his condition and the event, then tell me"
91619,91620,The Tempest,28.0,1.2.136,PROSPERO,If this might be a brother.
91620,91621,The Tempest,29.0,1.2.137,MIRANDA,I should sin
91621,91622,The Tempest,29.0,1.2.138,MIRANDA,To think but nobly of my grandmother:
91622,91623,The Tempest,29.0,1.2.139,MIRANDA,Good wombs have borne bad sons.
91623,91624,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.140,PROSPERO,Now the condition.
91624,91625,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.141,PROSPERO,"The King of Naples, being an enemy"
91625,91626,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.142,PROSPERO,"To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit,"
91626,91627,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.143,PROSPERO,"Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises"
91627,91628,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.144,PROSPERO,"Of homage and I know not how much tribute,"
91628,91629,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.145,PROSPERO,Should presently extirpate me and mine
91629,91630,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.146,PROSPERO,Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
91630,91631,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.147,PROSPERO,"With all the honours on my brother: whereon,"
91631,91632,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.148,PROSPERO,"A treacherous army levied, one midnight"
91632,91633,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.149,PROSPERO,Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
91633,91634,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.150,PROSPERO,"The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,"
91634,91635,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.151,PROSPERO,The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
91635,91636,The Tempest,30.0,1.2.152,PROSPERO,Me and thy crying self.
91636,91637,The Tempest,31.0,1.2.153,MIRANDA,"Alack, for pity!"
91637,91638,The Tempest,31.0,1.2.154,MIRANDA,"I, not remembering how I cried out then,"
91638,91639,The Tempest,31.0,1.2.155,MIRANDA,Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
91639,91640,The Tempest,31.0,1.2.156,MIRANDA,That wrings mine eyes to't.
91640,91641,The Tempest,32.0,1.2.157,PROSPERO,Hear a little further
91641,91642,The Tempest,32.0,1.2.158,PROSPERO,And then I'll bring thee to the present business
91642,91643,The Tempest,32.0,1.2.159,PROSPERO,"Which now's upon's, without the which this story"
91643,91644,The Tempest,32.0,1.2.160,PROSPERO,Were most impertinent.
91644,91645,The Tempest,33.0,1.2.161,MIRANDA,Wherefore did they not
91645,91646,The Tempest,33.0,1.2.162,MIRANDA,That hour destroy us?
91646,91647,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.163,PROSPERO,"Well demanded, wench:"
91647,91648,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.164,PROSPERO,"My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,"
91648,91649,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.165,PROSPERO,"So dear the love my people bore me, nor set"
91649,91650,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.166,PROSPERO,"A mark so bloody on the business, but"
91650,91651,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.167,PROSPERO,With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
91651,91652,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.168,PROSPERO,"In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,"
91652,91653,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.169,PROSPERO,"Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared"
91653,91654,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.170,PROSPERO,"A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,"
91654,91655,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.171,PROSPERO,"Nor tackle, sail, nor mast, the very rats"
91655,91656,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.172,PROSPERO,"Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,"
91656,91657,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.173,PROSPERO,"To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh"
91657,91658,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.174,PROSPERO,"To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,"
91658,91659,The Tempest,34.0,1.2.175,PROSPERO,Did us but loving wrong.
91659,91660,The Tempest,35.0,1.2.176,MIRANDA,"Alack, what trouble"
91660,91661,The Tempest,35.0,1.2.177,MIRANDA,Was I then to you!
91661,91662,The Tempest,36.0,1.2.178,PROSPERO,"O, a cherubim"
91662,91663,The Tempest,36.0,1.2.179,PROSPERO,Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
91663,91664,The Tempest,36.0,1.2.180,PROSPERO,"Infused with a fortitude from heaven,"
91664,91665,The Tempest,36.0,1.2.181,PROSPERO,"When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,"
91665,91666,The Tempest,36.0,1.2.182,PROSPERO,"Under my burthen groan'd, which raised in me"
91666,91667,The Tempest,36.0,1.2.183,PROSPERO,"An undergoing stomach, to bear up"
91667,91668,The Tempest,36.0,1.2.184,PROSPERO,Against what should ensue.
91668,91669,The Tempest,37.0,1.2.185,MIRANDA,How came we ashore?
91669,91670,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.186,PROSPERO,By Providence divine.
91670,91671,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.187,PROSPERO,Some food we had and some fresh water that
91671,91672,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.188,PROSPERO,"A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,"
91672,91673,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.189,PROSPERO,"Out of his charity, being then appointed"
91673,91674,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.190,PROSPERO,"Master of this design, did give us, with"
91674,91675,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.191,PROSPERO,"Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,"
91675,91676,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.192,PROSPERO,"Which since have steaded much, so, of his gentleness,"
91676,91677,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.193,PROSPERO,"Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me"
91677,91678,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.194,PROSPERO,From mine own library with volumes that
91678,91679,The Tempest,38.0,1.2.195,PROSPERO,I prize above my dukedom.
91679,91680,The Tempest,39.0,1.2.196,MIRANDA,Would I might
91680,91681,The Tempest,39.0,1.2.197,MIRANDA,But ever see that man!
91681,91682,The Tempest,40.0,1.2.198,PROSPERO,Now I arise:
91682,91683,The Tempest,40.0,,PROSPERO,Resumes his mantle
91683,91684,The Tempest,40.0,1.2.199,PROSPERO,"Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow."
91684,91685,The Tempest,40.0,1.2.200,PROSPERO,"Here in this island we arrived, and here"
91685,91686,The Tempest,40.0,1.2.201,PROSPERO,"Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit"
91686,91687,The Tempest,40.0,1.2.202,PROSPERO,Than other princesses can that have more time
91687,91688,The Tempest,40.0,1.2.203,PROSPERO,For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
91688,91689,The Tempest,41.0,1.2.204,MIRANDA,"Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,"
91689,91690,The Tempest,41.0,1.2.205,MIRANDA,"For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason"
91690,91691,The Tempest,41.0,1.2.206,MIRANDA,For raising this sea-storm?
91691,91692,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.207,PROSPERO,Know thus far forth.
91692,91693,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.208,PROSPERO,"By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,"
91693,91694,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.209,PROSPERO,"Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies"
91694,91695,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.210,PROSPERO,"Brought to this shore, and by my prescience"
91695,91696,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.211,PROSPERO,I find my zenith doth depend upon
91696,91697,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.212,PROSPERO,"A most auspicious star, whose influence"
91697,91698,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.213,PROSPERO,"If now I court not but omit, my fortunes"
91698,91699,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.214,PROSPERO,Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
91699,91700,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.215,PROSPERO,"Thou art inclined to sleep, 'tis a good dulness,"
91700,91701,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.216,PROSPERO,And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
91701,91702,The Tempest,42.0,,PROSPERO,MIRANDA sleeps
91702,91703,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.217,PROSPERO,"Come away, servant, come. I am ready now."
91703,91704,The Tempest,42.0,1.2.218,PROSPERO,"Approach, my Ariel, come."
91704,91705,The Tempest,42.0,,PROSPERO,Enter ARIEL
91705,91706,The Tempest,43.0,1.2.219,ARIEL,"All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come"
91706,91707,The Tempest,43.0,1.2.220,ARIEL,"To answer thy best pleasure, be't to fly,"
91707,91708,The Tempest,43.0,1.2.221,ARIEL,"To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride"
91708,91709,The Tempest,43.0,1.2.222,ARIEL,"On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task"
91709,91710,The Tempest,43.0,1.2.223,ARIEL,Ariel and all his quality.
91710,91711,The Tempest,44.0,1.2.224,PROSPERO,"Hast thou, spirit,"
91711,91712,The Tempest,44.0,1.2.225,PROSPERO,Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
91712,91713,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.226,ARIEL,To every article.
91713,91714,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.227,ARIEL,"I boarded the king's ship, now on the beak,"
91714,91715,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.228,ARIEL,"Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,"
91715,91716,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.229,ARIEL,"I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,"
91716,91717,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.230,ARIEL,"And burn in many places, on the topmast,"
91717,91718,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.231,ARIEL,"The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,"
91718,91719,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.232,ARIEL,"Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors"
91719,91720,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.233,ARIEL,"O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary"
91720,91721,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.234,ARIEL,"And sight-outrunning were not, the fire and cracks"
91721,91722,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.235,ARIEL,Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
91722,91723,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.236,ARIEL,"Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,"
91723,91724,The Tempest,45.0,1.2.237,ARIEL,"Yea, his dread trident shake."
91724,91725,The Tempest,46.0,1.2.238,PROSPERO,My brave spirit!
91725,91726,The Tempest,46.0,1.2.239,PROSPERO,"Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil"
91726,91727,The Tempest,46.0,1.2.240,PROSPERO,Would not infect his reason?
91727,91728,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.241,ARIEL,Not a soul
91728,91729,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.242,ARIEL,But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
91729,91730,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.243,ARIEL,Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
91730,91731,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.244,ARIEL,"Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,"
91731,91732,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.245,ARIEL,"Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,"
91732,91733,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.246,ARIEL,"With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--"
91733,91734,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.247,ARIEL,"Was the first man that leap'd, cried, 'Hell is empty"
91734,91735,The Tempest,47.0,1.2.248,ARIEL,And all the devils are here.'
91735,91736,The Tempest,48.0,1.2.249,PROSPERO,Why that's my spirit!
91736,91737,The Tempest,48.0,1.2.250,PROSPERO,But was not this nigh shore?
91737,91738,The Tempest,49.0,1.2.251,ARIEL,"Close by, my master."
91738,91739,The Tempest,50.0,1.2.252,PROSPERO,"But are they, Ariel, safe?"
91739,91740,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.253,ARIEL,"Not a hair perish'd,"
91740,91741,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.254,ARIEL,"On their sustaining garments not a blemish,"
91741,91742,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.255,ARIEL,"But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,"
91742,91743,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.256,ARIEL,In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
91743,91744,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.257,ARIEL,"The king's son have I landed by himself,"
91744,91745,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.258,ARIEL,Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
91745,91746,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.259,ARIEL,"In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,"
91746,91747,The Tempest,51.0,1.2.260,ARIEL,His arms in this sad knot.
91747,91748,The Tempest,52.0,1.2.261,PROSPERO,Of the king's ship
91748,91749,The Tempest,52.0,1.2.262,PROSPERO,The mariners say how thou hast disposed
91749,91750,The Tempest,52.0,1.2.263,PROSPERO,And all the rest o' the fleet.
91750,91751,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.264,ARIEL,Safely in harbour
91751,91752,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.265,ARIEL,"Is the king's ship, in the deep nook, where once"
91752,91753,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.266,ARIEL,Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
91753,91754,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.267,ARIEL,"From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:"
91754,91755,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.268,ARIEL,"The mariners all under hatches stow'd,"
91755,91756,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.269,ARIEL,"Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,"
91756,91757,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.270,ARIEL,"I have left asleep, and for the rest o' the fleet"
91757,91758,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.271,ARIEL,"Which I dispersed, they all have met again"
91758,91759,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.272,ARIEL,"And are upon the Mediterranean flote,"
91759,91760,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.273,ARIEL,"Bound sadly home for Naples,"
91760,91761,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.274,ARIEL,Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
91761,91762,The Tempest,53.0,1.2.275,ARIEL,And his great person perish.
91762,91763,The Tempest,54.0,1.2.276,PROSPERO,"Ariel, thy charge"
91763,91764,The Tempest,54.0,1.2.277,PROSPERO,Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
91764,91765,The Tempest,54.0,1.2.278,PROSPERO,What is the time o' the day?
91765,91766,The Tempest,55.0,1.2.279,ARIEL,Past the mid season.
91766,91767,The Tempest,56.0,1.2.280,PROSPERO,At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
91767,91768,The Tempest,56.0,1.2.281,PROSPERO,Must by us both be spent most preciously.
91768,91769,The Tempest,57.0,1.2.282,ARIEL,"Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,"
91769,91770,The Tempest,57.0,1.2.283,ARIEL,"Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,"
91770,91771,The Tempest,57.0,1.2.284,ARIEL,Which is not yet perform'd me.

91955,91956,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.460,FERDINAND,"No, it begins again."
91956,91957,The Tempest,99.0,,FERDINAND,ARIEL sings
91957,91958,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.461,FERDINAND,"Full fathom five thy father lies,"
91958,91959,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.462,FERDINAND,"Of his bones are coral made,"
91959,91960,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.463,FERDINAND,Those are pearls that were his eyes:
91960,91961,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.464,FERDINAND,Nothing of him that doth fade
91961,91962,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.465,FERDINAND,But doth suffer a sea-change
91962,91963,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.466,FERDINAND,Into something rich and strange.
91963,91964,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.467,FERDINAND,Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
91964,91965,The Tempest,99.0,,FERDINAND,Burthen Ding-dong
91965,91966,The Tempest,99.0,1.2.468,FERDINAND,"Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell."
91966,91967,The Tempest,100.0,1.2.469,FERDINAND,The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
91967,91968,The Tempest,100.0,1.2.470,FERDINAND,"This is no mortal business, nor no sound"
91968,91969,The Tempest,100.0,1.2.471,FERDINAND,That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
91969,91970,The Tempest,101.0,1.2.472,PROSPERO,The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
91970,91971,The Tempest,101.0,1.2.473,PROSPERO,And say what thou seest yond.
91971,91972,The Tempest,102.0,1.2.474,MIRANDA,What is't? a spirit?
91972,91973,The Tempest,102.0,1.2.475,MIRANDA,"Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,"
91973,91974,The Tempest,102.0,1.2.476,MIRANDA,It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
91974,91975,The Tempest,103.0,1.2.477,PROSPERO,"No, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses"
91975,91976,The Tempest,103.0,1.2.478,PROSPERO,"As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest"
91976,91977,The Tempest,103.0,1.2.479,PROSPERO,"Was in the wreck, and, but he's something stain'd"
91977,91978,The Tempest,103.0,1.2.480,PROSPERO,"With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him"
91978,91979,The Tempest,103.0,1.2.481,PROSPERO,A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
91979,91980,The Tempest,103.0,1.2.482,PROSPERO,And strays about to find 'em.
91980,91981,The Tempest,104.0,1.2.483,MIRANDA,I might call him
91981,91982,The Tempest,104.0,1.2.484,MIRANDA,"A thing divine, for nothing natural"
91982,91983,The Tempest,104.0,1.2.485,MIRANDA,I ever saw so noble.
91983,91984,The Tempest,105.0,1.2.486,PROSPERO,"[Aside] It goes on, I see,"
91984,91985,The Tempest,105.0,1.2.487,PROSPERO,"As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee"
91985,91986,The Tempest,105.0,1.2.488,PROSPERO,Within two days for this.
91986,91987,The Tempest,106.0,1.2.489,FERDINAND,"Most sure, the goddess"
91987,91988,The Tempest,106.0,1.2.490,FERDINAND,On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
91988,91989,The Tempest,106.0,1.2.491,FERDINAND,"May know if you remain upon this island,"
91989,91990,The Tempest,106.0,1.2.492,FERDINAND,And that you will some good instruction give
91990,91991,The Tempest,106.0,1.2.493,FERDINAND,"How I may bear me here: my prime request,"
91991,91992,The Tempest,106.0,1.2.494,FERDINAND,"Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!"
91992,91993,The Tempest,106.0,1.2.495,FERDINAND,If you be maid or no?
91993,91994,The Tempest,107.0,1.2.496,MIRANDA,"No wonder, sir,"
91994,91995,The Tempest,107.0,1.2.497,MIRANDA,But certainly a maid.
91995,91996,The Tempest,108.0,1.2.498,FERDINAND,My language! heavens!
91996,91997,The Tempest,108.0,1.2.499,FERDINAND,"I am the best of them that speak this speech,"
91997,91998,The Tempest,108.0,1.2.500,FERDINAND,Were I but where 'tis spoken.
91998,91999,The Tempest,109.0,1.2.501,PROSPERO,How? the best?
91999,92000,The Tempest,109.0,1.2.502,PROSPERO,"What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?"
92000,92001,The Tempest,110.0,1.2.503,FERDINAND,"A single thing, as I am now, that wonders"
92001,92002,The Tempest,110.0,1.2.504,FERDINAND,"To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,"
92002,92003,The Tempest,110.0,1.2.505,FERDINAND,"And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,"
92003,92004,The Tempest,110.0,1.2.506,FERDINAND,"Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld"
92004,92005,The Tempest,110.0,1.2.507,FERDINAND,The king my father wreck'd.
92005,92006,The Tempest,111.0,1.2.508,MIRANDA,"Alack, for mercy!"
92006,92007,The Tempest,112.0,1.2.509,FERDINAND,"Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan"
92007,92008,The Tempest,112.0,1.2.510,FERDINAND,And his brave son being twain.
92008,92009,The Tempest,113.0,1.2.511,PROSPERO,[Aside]	The Duke of Milan
92009,92010,The Tempest,113.0,1.2.512,PROSPERO,"And his more braver daughter could control thee,"
92010,92011,The Tempest,113.0,1.2.513,PROSPERO,If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
92011,92012,The Tempest,113.0,1.2.514,PROSPERO,"They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,"
92012,92013,The Tempest,113.0,1.2.515,PROSPERO,I'll set thee free for this.
92013,92014,The Tempest,113.0,,PROSPERO,To FERDINAND
92014,92015,The Tempest,113.0,1.2.516,PROSPERO,"A word, good sir,"
92015,92016,The Tempest,113.0,1.2.517,PROSPERO,I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
92016,92017,The Tempest,114.0,1.2.518,MIRANDA,Why speaks my father so ungently? This
92017,92018,The Tempest,114.0,1.2.519,MIRANDA,"Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first"
92018,92019,The Tempest,114.0,1.2.520,MIRANDA,That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
92019,92020,The Tempest,114.0,1.2.521,MIRANDA,To be inclined my way!
92020,92021,The Tempest,115.0,1.2.522,FERDINAND,"O, if a virgin,"
92021,92022,The Tempest,115.0,1.2.523,FERDINAND,"And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you"
92022,92023,The Tempest,115.0,1.2.524,FERDINAND,The queen of Naples.
92023,92024,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.525,PROSPERO,"Soft, sir! one word more."
92024,92025,The Tempest,116.0,,PROSPERO,Aside
92025,92026,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.526,PROSPERO,"They are both in either's powers, but this swift business"
92026,92027,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.527,PROSPERO,"I must uneasy make, lest too light winning"
92027,92028,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.528,PROSPERO,Make the prize light.
92028,92029,The Tempest,116.0,,PROSPERO,To FERDINAND
92029,92030,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.529,PROSPERO,"One word more, I charge thee"
92030,92031,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.530,PROSPERO,That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
92031,92032,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.531,PROSPERO,"The name thou owest not, and hast put thyself"
92032,92033,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.532,PROSPERO,"Upon this island as a spy, to win it"
92033,92034,The Tempest,116.0,1.2.533,PROSPERO,"From me, the lord on't."
92034,92035,The Tempest,117.0,1.2.534,FERDINAND,"No, as I am a man."
92035,92036,The Tempest,118.0,1.2.535,MIRANDA,There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
92036,92037,The Tempest,118.0,1.2.536,MIRANDA,"If the ill spirit have so fair a house,"
92037,92038,The Tempest,118.0,1.2.537,MIRANDA,Good things will strive to dwell with't.
92038,92039,The Tempest,119.0,1.2.538,PROSPERO,Follow me.
92039,92040,The Tempest,119.0,1.2.539,PROSPERO,"Speak not you for him, he's a traitor. Come,"
92040,92041,The Tempest,119.0,1.2.540,PROSPERO,I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
92041,92042,The Tempest,119.0,1.2.541,PROSPERO,"Sea-water shalt thou drink, thy food shall be"
92042,92043,The Tempest,119.0,1.2.542,PROSPERO,"The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks"
92043,92044,The Tempest,119.0,1.2.543,PROSPERO,Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
92044,92045,The Tempest,120.0,1.2.544,FERDINAND,"No,"
92045,92046,The Tempest,120.0,1.2.545,FERDINAND,I will resist such entertainment till
92046,92047,The Tempest,120.0,1.2.546,FERDINAND,Mine enemy has more power.
92047,92048,The Tempest,120.0,,FERDINAND,"Draws, and is charmed from moving"
92048,92049,The Tempest,121.0,1.2.547,MIRANDA,"O dear father,"
92049,92050,The Tempest,121.0,1.2.548,MIRANDA,"Make not too rash a trial of him, for"
92050,92051,The Tempest,121.0,1.2.549,MIRANDA,He's gentle and not fearful.
92051,92052,The Tempest,122.0,1.2.550,PROSPERO,"What? I say,"
92052,92053,The Tempest,122.0,1.2.551,PROSPERO,"My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor,"
92053,92054,The Tempest,122.0,1.2.552,PROSPERO,"Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience"
92054,92055,The Tempest,122.0,1.2.553,PROSPERO,"Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,"
92055,92056,The Tempest,122.0,1.2.554,PROSPERO,For I can here disarm thee with this stick
92056,92057,The Tempest,122.0,1.2.555,PROSPERO,And make thy weapon drop.
92057,92058,The Tempest,123.0,1.2.556,MIRANDA,"Beseech you, father."
92058,92059,The Tempest,124.0,1.2.557,PROSPERO,Hence! hang not on my garments.
92059,92060,The Tempest,125.0,1.2.558,MIRANDA,"Sir, have pity,"
92060,92061,The Tempest,125.0,1.2.559,MIRANDA,I'll be his surety.
92061,92062,The Tempest,126.0,1.2.560,PROSPERO,Silence! one word more
92062,92063,The Tempest,126.0,1.2.561,PROSPERO,"Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!"
92063,92064,The Tempest,126.0,1.2.562,PROSPERO,An advocate for an imposter! hush!
92064,92065,The Tempest,126.0,1.2.563,PROSPERO,"Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,"
92065,92066,The Tempest,126.0,1.2.564,PROSPERO,Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
92066,92067,The Tempest,126.0,1.2.565,PROSPERO,To the most of men this is a Caliban
92067,92068,The Tempest,126.0,1.2.566,PROSPERO,And they to him are angels.
92068,92069,The Tempest,127.0,1.2.567,MIRANDA,My affections
92069,92070,The Tempest,127.0,1.2.568,MIRANDA,"Are then most humble, I have no ambition"
92070,92071,The Tempest,127.0,1.2.569,MIRANDA,To see a goodlier man.
92071,92072,The Tempest,128.0,1.2.570,PROSPERO,"Come on, obey:"
92072,92073,The Tempest,128.0,1.2.571,PROSPERO,Thy nerves are in their infancy again
92073,92074,The Tempest,128.0,1.2.572,PROSPERO,And have no vigour in them.
92074,92075,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.573,FERDINAND,"So they are,"
92075,92076,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.574,FERDINAND,"My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up."
92076,92077,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.575,FERDINAND,"My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,"
92077,92078,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.576,FERDINAND,"The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,"
92078,92079,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.577,FERDINAND,"To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,"
92079,92080,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.578,FERDINAND,Might I but through my prison once a day
92080,92081,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.579,FERDINAND,Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
92081,92082,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.580,FERDINAND,"Let liberty make use of, space enough"
92082,92083,The Tempest,129.0,1.2.581,FERDINAND,Have I in such a prison.
92083,92084,The Tempest,130.0,1.2.582,PROSPERO,[Aside]                It works.
92084,92085,The Tempest,130.0,,PROSPERO,To FERDINAND
92085,92086,The Tempest,130.0,1.2.583,PROSPERO,Come on.
92086,92087,The Tempest,130.0,1.2.584,PROSPERO,"Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!"
92087,92088,The Tempest,130.0,,PROSPERO,To FERDINAND
92088,92089,The Tempest,130.0,1.2.585,PROSPERO,Follow me.
92089,92090,The Tempest,130.0,,PROSPERO,To ARIEL
92090,92091,The Tempest,130.0,1.2.586,PROSPERO,Hark what thou else shalt do me.
92091,92092,The Tempest,131.0,1.2.587,MIRANDA,"Be of comfort,"
92092,92093,The Tempest,131.0,1.2.588,MIRANDA,"My father's of a better nature, sir,"
92093,92094,The Tempest,131.0,1.2.589,MIRANDA,Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
92094,92095,The Tempest,131.0,1.2.590,MIRANDA,Which now came from him.
92095,92096,The Tempest,132.0,1.2.591,PROSPERO,Thou shalt be free
92096,92097,The Tempest,132.0,1.2.592,PROSPERO,As mountain winds: but then exactly do
92097,92098,The Tempest,132.0,1.2.593,PROSPERO,All points of my command.
92098,92099,The Tempest,133.0,1.2.594,ARIEL,To the syllable.
92099,92100,The Tempest,134.0,1.2.595,PROSPERO,"Come, follow. Speak not for him."
92100,92101,The Tempest,134.0,,PROSPERO,Exeunt
92101,92102,The Tempest,134.0,,PROSPERO,ACT II
92102,92103,The Tempest,134.0,,PROSPERO,SCENE I. Another part of the island.
92103,92104,The Tempest,134.0,,PROSPERO,"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others"
92104,92105,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.1,GONZALO,"Beseech you, sir, be merry, you have cause,"
92105,92106,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.2,GONZALO,"So have we all, of joy, for our escape"
92106,92107,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.3,GONZALO,Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
92107,92108,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.4,GONZALO,"Is common, every day some sailor's wife,"
92108,92109,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.5,GONZALO,The masters of some merchant and the merchant
92109,92110,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.6,GONZALO,"Have just our theme of woe, but for the miracle,"
92110,92111,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.7,GONZALO,"I mean our preservation, few in millions"
92111,92112,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.8,GONZALO,"Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh"
92112,92113,The Tempest,1.0,2.1.9,GONZALO,Our sorrow with our comfort.
92113,92114,The Tempest,2.0,2.1.10,ALONSO,"Prithee, peace."
92114,92115,The Tempest,3.0,2.1.11,SEBASTIAN,He receives comfort like cold porridge.
92115,92116,The Tempest,4.0,2.1.12,ANTONIO,The visitor will not give him o'er so.
92116,92117,The Tempest,5.0,2.1.13,SEBASTIAN,"Look he's winding up the watch of his wit,"
92117,92118,The Tempest,5.0,2.1.14,SEBASTIAN,by and by it will strike.
92118,92119,The Tempest,6.0,2.1.15,GONZALO,"Sir,--"
92119,92120,The Tempest,7.0,2.1.16,SEBASTIAN,One: tell.
92120,92121,The Tempest,8.0,2.1.17,GONZALO,"When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,"
92121,92122,The Tempest,8.0,2.1.18,GONZALO,Comes to the entertainer--
92122,92123,The Tempest,9.0,2.1.19,SEBASTIAN,A dollar.
92123,92124,The Tempest,10.0,2.1.20,GONZALO,"Dolour comes to him, indeed: you"
92124,92125,The Tempest,10.0,2.1.21,GONZALO,have spoken truer than you purposed.
92125,92126,The Tempest,11.0,2.1.22,SEBASTIAN,You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
92126,92127,The Tempest,12.0,2.1.23,GONZALO,"Therefore, my lord,--"
92127,92128,The Tempest,13.0,2.1.24,ANTONIO,"Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!"
92128,92129,The Tempest,14.0,2.1.25,ALONSO,"I prithee, spare."
92129,92130,The Tempest,15.0,2.1.26,GONZALO,"Well, I have done: but yet,--"
92130,92131,The Tempest,16.0,2.1.27,SEBASTIAN,He will be talking.
92131,92132,The Tempest,17.0,2.1.28,ANTONIO,"Which, of he or Adrian, for a good"
92132,92133,The Tempest,17.0,2.1.29,ANTONIO,"wager, first begins to crow?"
92133,92134,The Tempest,18.0,2.1.30,SEBASTIAN,The old cock.
92134,92135,The Tempest,19.0,2.1.31,ANTONIO,The cockerel.
92135,92136,The Tempest,20.0,2.1.32,SEBASTIAN,Done. The wager?
92136,92137,The Tempest,21.0,2.1.33,ANTONIO,A laughter.
92137,92138,The Tempest,22.0,2.1.34,SEBASTIAN,A match!
92138,92139,The Tempest,23.0,2.1.35,ADRIAN,"Though this island seem to be desert,--"
92139,92140,The Tempest,24.0,2.1.36,SEBASTIAN,"Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid."
92140,92141,The Tempest,25.0,2.1.37,ADRIAN,"Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--"
92141,92142,The Tempest,26.0,2.1.38,SEBASTIAN,"Yet,--"
92142,92143,The Tempest,27.0,2.1.39,ADRIAN,"Yet,--"
92143,92144,The Tempest,28.0,2.1.40,ANTONIO,He could not miss't.
92144,92145,The Tempest,29.0,2.1.41,ADRIAN,"It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate"
92145,92146,The Tempest,29.0,2.1.42,ADRIAN,temperance.
92146,92147,The Tempest,30.0,2.1.43,ANTONIO,Temperance was a delicate wench.
92147,92148,The Tempest,31.0,2.1.44,SEBASTIAN,"Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered."
92148,92149,The Tempest,32.0,2.1.45,ADRIAN,The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
92149,92150,The Tempest,33.0,2.1.46,SEBASTIAN,As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
92150,92151,The Tempest,34.0,2.1.47,ANTONIO,Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
92151,92152,The Tempest,35.0,2.1.48,GONZALO,Here is everything advantageous to life.
92152,92153,The Tempest,36.0,2.1.49,ANTONIO,"True, save means to live."
92153,92154,The Tempest,37.0,2.1.50,SEBASTIAN,"Of that there's none, or little."
92154,92155,The Tempest,38.0,2.1.51,GONZALO,How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
92155,92156,The Tempest,39.0,2.1.52,ANTONIO,The ground indeed is tawny.
92156,92157,The Tempest,40.0,2.1.53,SEBASTIAN,With an eye of green in't.
92157,92158,The Tempest,41.0,2.1.54,ANTONIO,He misses not much.
92158,92159,The Tempest,42.0,2.1.55,SEBASTIAN,"No, he doth but mistake the truth totally."
92159,92160,The Tempest,43.0,2.1.56,GONZALO,"But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost"
92160,92161,The Tempest,43.0,2.1.57,GONZALO,"beyond credit,--"
92161,92162,The Tempest,44.0,2.1.58,SEBASTIAN,As many vouched rarities are.
92162,92163,The Tempest,45.0,2.1.59,GONZALO,"That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in"
92163,92164,The Tempest,45.0,2.1.60,GONZALO,"the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and"
92164,92165,The Tempest,45.0,2.1.61,GONZALO,"glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with"
92165,92166,The Tempest,45.0,2.1.62,GONZALO,salt water.
92166,92167,The Tempest,46.0,2.1.63,ANTONIO,"If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not"
92167,92168,The Tempest,46.0,2.1.64,ANTONIO,say he lies?
92168,92169,The Tempest,47.0,2.1.65,SEBASTIAN,"Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report"
92169,92170,The Tempest,48.0,2.1.66,GONZALO,Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
92170,92171,The Tempest,48.0,2.1.67,GONZALO,"put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of"
92171,92172,The Tempest,48.0,2.1.68,GONZALO,the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
92172,92173,The Tempest,49.0,2.1.69,SEBASTIAN,"'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return."
92173,92174,The Tempest,50.0,2.1.70,ADRIAN,Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
92174,92175,The Tempest,50.0,2.1.71,ADRIAN,their queen.
92175,92176,The Tempest,51.0,2.1.72,GONZALO,Not since widow Dido's time.
92176,92177,The Tempest,52.0,2.1.73,ANTONIO,Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
92177,92178,The Tempest,52.0,2.1.74,ANTONIO,widow Dido!
92178,92179,The Tempest,53.0,2.1.75,SEBASTIAN,"What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,"
92179,92180,The Tempest,53.0,2.1.76,SEBASTIAN,how you take it!
92180,92181,The Tempest,54.0,2.1.77,ADRIAN,'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
92181,92182,The Tempest,54.0,2.1.78,ADRIAN,"she was of Carthage, not of Tunis."
92182,92183,The Tempest,55.0,2.1.79,GONZALO,"This Tunis, sir, was Carthage."
92183,92184,The Tempest,56.0,2.1.80,ADRIAN,Carthage?
92184,92185,The Tempest,57.0,2.1.81,GONZALO,"I assure you, Carthage."
92185,92186,The Tempest,58.0,2.1.82,SEBASTIAN,"His word is more than the miraculous harp, he hath"
92186,92187,The Tempest,58.0,2.1.83,SEBASTIAN,raised the wall and houses too.
92187,92188,The Tempest,59.0,2.1.84,ANTONIO,What impossible matter will he make easy next?
92188,92189,The Tempest,60.0,2.1.85,SEBASTIAN,I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
92189,92190,The Tempest,60.0,2.1.86,SEBASTIAN,and give it his son for an apple.
92190,92191,The Tempest,61.0,2.1.87,ANTONIO,"And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring"
92191,92192,The Tempest,61.0,2.1.88,ANTONIO,forth more islands.
92192,92193,The Tempest,62.0,2.1.89,GONZALO,Ay.
92193,92194,The Tempest,63.0,2.1.90,ANTONIO,"Why, in good time."
92194,92195,The Tempest,64.0,2.1.91,GONZALO,"Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now"
92195,92196,The Tempest,64.0,2.1.92,GONZALO,as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
92196,92197,The Tempest,64.0,2.1.93,GONZALO,"of your daughter, who is now queen."
92197,92198,The Tempest,65.0,2.1.94,ANTONIO,And the rarest that e'er came there.
92198,92199,The Tempest,66.0,2.1.95,SEBASTIAN,"Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido."
92199,92200,The Tempest,67.0,2.1.96,ANTONIO,"O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido."
92200,92201,The Tempest,68.0,2.1.97,GONZALO,"Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I"
92201,92202,The Tempest,68.0,2.1.98,GONZALO,"wore it? I mean, in a sort."
92202,92203,The Tempest,69.0,2.1.99,ANTONIO,That sort was well fished for.
92203,92204,The Tempest,70.0,2.1.100,GONZALO,When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
92204,92205,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.101,ALONSO,You cram these words into mine ears against
92205,92206,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.102,ALONSO,The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
92206,92207,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.103,ALONSO,"Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,"
92207,92208,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.104,ALONSO,"My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,"
92208,92209,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.105,ALONSO,Who is so far from Italy removed
92209,92210,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.106,ALONSO,I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
92210,92211,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.107,ALONSO,"Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish"
92211,92212,The Tempest,71.0,2.1.108,ALONSO,Hath made his meal on thee?
92212,92213,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.109,FRANCISCO,"Sir, he may live:"
92213,92214,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.110,FRANCISCO,"I saw him beat the surges under him,"
92214,92215,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.111,FRANCISCO,"And ride upon their backs, he trod the water,"
92215,92216,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.112,FRANCISCO,"Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted"
92216,92217,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.113,FRANCISCO,"The surge most swoln that met him, his bold head"
92217,92218,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.114,FRANCISCO,"'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd"
92218,92219,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.115,FRANCISCO,Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
92219,92220,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.116,FRANCISCO,"To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,"
92220,92221,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.117,FRANCISCO,As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
92221,92222,The Tempest,72.0,2.1.118,FRANCISCO,He came alive to land.
92222,92223,The Tempest,73.0,2.1.119,ALONSO,"No, no, he's gone."
92223,92224,The Tempest,74.0,2.1.120,SEBASTIAN,"Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,"
92224,92225,The Tempest,74.0,2.1.121,SEBASTIAN,"That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,"
92225,92226,The Tempest,74.0,2.1.122,SEBASTIAN,"But rather lose her to an African,"
92226,92227,The Tempest,74.0,2.1.123,SEBASTIAN,"Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,"
92227,92228,The Tempest,74.0,2.1.124,SEBASTIAN,Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
92228,92229,The Tempest,75.0,2.1.125,ALONSO,"Prithee, peace."
92229,92230,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.126,SEBASTIAN,You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
92230,92231,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.127,SEBASTIAN,"By all of us, and the fair soul herself"
92231,92232,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.128,SEBASTIAN,"Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at"
92232,92233,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.129,SEBASTIAN,Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
92233,92234,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.130,SEBASTIAN,"son,"
92234,92235,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.131,SEBASTIAN,"I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have"
92235,92236,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.132,SEBASTIAN,More widows in them of this business' making
92236,92237,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.133,SEBASTIAN,Than we bring men to comfort them:
92237,92238,The Tempest,76.0,2.1.134,SEBASTIAN,The fault's your own.
92238,92239,The Tempest,77.0,2.1.135,ALONSO,So is the dear'st o' the loss.
92239,92240,The Tempest,78.0,2.1.136,GONZALO,"My lord Sebastian,"
92240,92241,The Tempest,78.0,2.1.137,GONZALO,The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
92241,92242,The Tempest,78.0,2.1.138,GONZALO,"And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,"
92242,92243,The Tempest,78.0,2.1.139,GONZALO,When you should bring the plaster.
92243,92244,The Tempest,79.0,2.1.140,SEBASTIAN,Very well.
92244,92245,The Tempest,80.0,2.1.141,ANTONIO,And most chirurgeonly.
92245,92246,The Tempest,81.0,2.1.142,GONZALO,"It is foul weather in us all, good sir,"
92246,92247,The Tempest,81.0,2.1.143,GONZALO,When you are cloudy.
92247,92248,The Tempest,82.0,2.1.144,SEBASTIAN,Foul weather?
92248,92249,The Tempest,83.0,2.1.145,ANTONIO,Very foul.
92249,92250,The Tempest,84.0,2.1.146,GONZALO,"Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--"
92250,92251,The Tempest,85.0,2.1.147,ANTONIO,He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
92251,92252,The Tempest,86.0,2.1.148,SEBASTIAN,"Or docks, or mallows."
92252,92253,The Tempest,87.0,2.1.149,GONZALO,"And were the king on't, what would I do?"
92253,92254,The Tempest,88.0,2.1.150,SEBASTIAN,'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
92254,92255,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.151,GONZALO,I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
92255,92256,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.152,GONZALO,"Execute all things, for no kind of traffic"
92256,92257,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.153,GONZALO,"Would I admit, no name of magistrate,"
92257,92258,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.154,GONZALO,"Letters should not be known, riches, poverty,"
92258,92259,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.155,GONZALO,"And use of service, none, contract, succession,"
92259,92260,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.156,GONZALO,"Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none,"
92260,92261,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.157,GONZALO,"No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil,"
92261,92262,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.158,GONZALO,"No occupation, all men idle, all,"
92262,92263,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.159,GONZALO,"And women too, but innocent and pure,"
92263,92264,The Tempest,89.0,2.1.160,GONZALO,"No sovereignty,--"
92264,92265,The Tempest,90.0,2.1.161,SEBASTIAN,Yet he would be king on't.
92265,92266,The Tempest,91.0,2.1.162,ANTONIO,The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
92266,92267,The Tempest,91.0,2.1.163,ANTONIO,beginning.
92267,92268,The Tempest,92.0,2.1.164,GONZALO,All things in common nature should produce
92268,92269,The Tempest,92.0,2.1.165,GONZALO,"Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,"
92269,92270,The Tempest,92.0,2.1.166,GONZALO,"Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,"
92270,92271,The Tempest,92.0,2.1.167,GONZALO,"Would I not have, but nature should bring forth,"
92271,92272,The Tempest,92.0,2.1.168,GONZALO,"Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,"
92272,92273,The Tempest,92.0,2.1.169,GONZALO,To feed my innocent people.
92273,92274,The Tempest,93.0,2.1.170,SEBASTIAN,No marrying 'mong his subjects?
92274,92275,The Tempest,94.0,2.1.171,ANTONIO,"None, man, all idle: whores and knaves."
92275,92276,The Tempest,95.0,2.1.172,GONZALO,"I would with such perfection govern, sir,"
92276,92277,The Tempest,95.0,2.1.173,GONZALO,To excel the golden age.
92277,92278,The Tempest,96.0,2.1.174,SEBASTIAN,God save his majesty!
92278,92279,The Tempest,97.0,2.1.175,ANTONIO,Long live Gonzalo!
92279,92280,The Tempest,98.0,2.1.176,GONZALO,"And,--do you mark me, sir?"
92280,92281,The Tempest,99.0,2.1.177,ALONSO,"Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me."
92281,92282,The Tempest,100.0,2.1.178,GONZALO,"I do well believe your highness, and"
92282,92283,The Tempest,100.0,2.1.179,GONZALO,"did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,"
92283,92284,The Tempest,100.0,2.1.180,GONZALO,who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
92284,92285,The Tempest,100.0,2.1.181,GONZALO,they always use to laugh at nothing.
92285,92286,The Tempest,101.0,2.1.182,ANTONIO,'Twas you we laughed at.
92286,92287,The Tempest,102.0,2.1.183,GONZALO,Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
92287,92288,The Tempest,102.0,2.1.184,GONZALO,to you: so you may continue and laugh at
92288,92289,The Tempest,102.0,2.1.185,GONZALO,nothing still.
92289,92290,The Tempest,103.0,2.1.186,ANTONIO,What a blow was there given!
92290,92291,The Tempest,104.0,2.1.187,SEBASTIAN,An it had not fallen flat-long.
92291,92292,The Tempest,105.0,2.1.188,GONZALO,"You are gentlemen of brave metal, you would lift"
92292,92293,The Tempest,105.0,2.1.189,GONZALO,"the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue"
92293,92294,The Tempest,105.0,2.1.190,GONZALO,in it five weeks without changing.

92297,92298,The Tempest,108.0,2.1.193,GONZALO,"No, I warrant you, I will not adventure"
92298,92299,The Tempest,108.0,2.1.194,GONZALO,my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh

92300,92301,The Tempest,109.0,2.1.196,ANTONIO,"Go sleep, and hear us."

92303,92304,The Tempest,110.0,2.1.198,ALONSO,"Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find"
92304,92305,The Tempest,110.0,2.1.199,ALONSO,They are inclined to do so.
92305,92306,The Tempest,111.0,2.1.200,SEBASTIAN,"Please you, sir,"
92306,92307,The Tempest,111.0,2.1.201,SEBASTIAN,Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
92307,92308,The Tempest,111.0,2.1.202,SEBASTIAN,"It seldom visits sorrow, when it doth,"
92308,92309,The Tempest,111.0,2.1.203,SEBASTIAN,It is a comforter.
92309,92310,The Tempest,112.0,2.1.204,ANTONIO,"We two, my lord,"
92310,92311,The Tempest,112.0,2.1.205,ANTONIO,"Will guard your person while you take your rest,"
92311,92312,The Tempest,112.0,2.1.206,ANTONIO,And watch your safety.
92312,92313,The Tempest,113.0,2.1.207,ALONSO,Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
92313,92314,The Tempest,113.0,,ALONSO,ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL
92314,92315,The Tempest,114.0,2.1.208,SEBASTIAN,What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
92315,92316,The Tempest,115.0,2.1.209,ANTONIO,It is the quality o' the climate.
92316,92317,The Tempest,116.0,2.1.210,SEBASTIAN,Why
92317,92318,The Tempest,116.0,2.1.211,SEBASTIAN,Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not

92319,92320,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.213,ANTONIO,"Nor I, my spirits are nimble."
92320,92321,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.214,ANTONIO,"They fell together all, as by consent,"
92321,92322,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.215,ANTONIO,"They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,"
92322,92323,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.216,ANTONIO,"Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--"
92323,92324,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.217,ANTONIO,"And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,"
92324,92325,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.218,ANTONIO,"What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and"
92325,92326,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.219,ANTONIO,My strong imagination sees a crown
92326,92327,The Tempest,117.0,2.1.220,ANTONIO,Dropping upon thy head.
92327,92328,The Tempest,118.0,2.1.221,SEBASTIAN,"What, art thou waking?"
92328,92329,The Tempest,119.0,2.1.222,ANTONIO,Do you not hear me speak?
92329,92330,The Tempest,120.0,2.1.223,SEBASTIAN,"I do, and surely"
92330,92331,The Tempest,120.0,2.1.224,SEBASTIAN,It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
92331,92332,The Tempest,120.0,2.1.225,SEBASTIAN,Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
92332,92333,The Tempest,120.0,2.1.226,SEBASTIAN,"This is a strange repose, to be asleep"
92333,92334,The Tempest,120.0,2.1.227,SEBASTIAN,"With eyes wide open, standing, speaking, moving,"
92334,92335,The Tempest,120.0,2.1.228,SEBASTIAN,And yet so fast asleep.
92335,92336,The Tempest,121.0,2.1.229,ANTONIO,"Noble Sebastian,"
92336,92337,The Tempest,121.0,2.1.230,ANTONIO,"Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather, wink'st"
92337,92338,The Tempest,121.0,2.1.231,ANTONIO,Whiles thou art waking.
92338,92339,The Tempest,122.0,2.1.232,SEBASTIAN,"Thou dost snore distinctly,"
92339,92340,The Tempest,122.0,2.1.233,SEBASTIAN,There's meaning in thy snores.
92340,92341,The Tempest,123.0,2.1.234,ANTONIO,I am more serious than my custom: you
92341,92342,The Tempest,123.0,2.1.235,ANTONIO,"Must be so too, if heed me, which to do"
92342,92343,The Tempest,123.0,2.1.236,ANTONIO,Trebles thee o'er.
92343,92344,The Tempest,124.0,2.1.237,SEBASTIAN,"Well, I am standing water."
92344,92345,The Tempest,125.0,2.1.238,ANTONIO,I'll teach you how to flow.
92345,92346,The Tempest,126.0,2.1.239,SEBASTIAN,Do so: to ebb
92346,92347,The Tempest,126.0,2.1.240,SEBASTIAN,Hereditary sloth instructs me.
92347,92348,The Tempest,127.0,2.1.241,ANTONIO,"O,"
92348,92349,The Tempest,127.0,2.1.242,ANTONIO,If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
92349,92350,The Tempest,127.0,2.1.243,ANTONIO,"Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,"
92350,92351,The Tempest,127.0,2.1.244,ANTONIO,"You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,"
92351,92352,The Tempest,127.0,2.1.245,ANTONIO,Most often do so near the bottom run
92352,92353,The Tempest,127.0,2.1.246,ANTONIO,By their own fear or sloth.
92353,92354,The Tempest,128.0,2.1.247,SEBASTIAN,"Prithee, say on:"
92354,92355,The Tempest,128.0,2.1.248,SEBASTIAN,The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
92355,92356,The Tempest,128.0,2.1.249,SEBASTIAN,"A matter from thee, and a birth indeed"
92356,92357,The Tempest,128.0,2.1.250,SEBASTIAN,Which throes thee much to yield.
92357,92358,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.251,ANTONIO,"Thus, sir:"
92358,92359,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.252,ANTONIO,"Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,"
92359,92360,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.253,ANTONIO,Who shall be of as little memory
92360,92361,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.254,ANTONIO,"When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--"
92361,92362,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.255,ANTONIO,"For he's a spirit of persuasion, only"
92362,92363,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.256,ANTONIO,"Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,"
92363,92364,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.257,ANTONIO,'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
92364,92365,The Tempest,129.0,2.1.258,ANTONIO,And he that sleeps here swims.
92365,92366,The Tempest,130.0,2.1.259,SEBASTIAN,I have no hope
92366,92367,The Tempest,130.0,2.1.260,SEBASTIAN,That he's undrown'd.
92367,92368,The Tempest,131.0,2.1.261,ANTONIO,"O, out of that 'no hope'"
92368,92369,The Tempest,131.0,2.1.262,ANTONIO,What great hope have you! no hope that way is
92369,92370,The Tempest,131.0,2.1.263,ANTONIO,Another way so high a hope that even
92370,92371,The Tempest,131.0,2.1.264,ANTONIO,"Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,"
92371,92372,The Tempest,131.0,2.1.265,ANTONIO,But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
92372,92373,The Tempest,131.0,2.1.266,ANTONIO,That Ferdinand is drown'd?
92373,92374,The Tempest,132.0,2.1.267,SEBASTIAN,He's gone.
92374,92375,The Tempest,133.0,2.1.268,ANTONIO,"Then, tell me,"
92375,92376,The Tempest,133.0,2.1.269,ANTONIO,Who's the next heir of Naples?
92376,92377,The Tempest,134.0,2.1.270,SEBASTIAN,Claribel.
92377,92378,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.271,ANTONIO,"She that is queen of Tunis, she that dwells"
92378,92379,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.272,ANTONIO,"Ten leagues beyond man's life, she that from Naples"
92379,92380,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.273,ANTONIO,"Can have no note, unless the sun were post--"
92380,92381,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.274,ANTONIO,The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
92381,92382,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.275,ANTONIO,"Be rough and razorable, she that--from whom?"
92382,92383,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.276,ANTONIO,"We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,"
92383,92384,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.277,ANTONIO,And by that destiny to perform an act
92384,92385,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.278,ANTONIO,"Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come"
92385,92386,The Tempest,135.0,2.1.279,ANTONIO,In yours and my discharge.
92386,92387,The Tempest,136.0,2.1.280,SEBASTIAN,What stuff is this! how say you?
92387,92388,The Tempest,136.0,2.1.281,SEBASTIAN,"'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis,"
92388,92389,The Tempest,136.0,2.1.282,SEBASTIAN,"So is she heir of Naples, 'twixt which regions"
92389,92390,The Tempest,136.0,2.1.283,SEBASTIAN,There is some space.
92390,92391,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.284,ANTONIO,A space whose every cubit
92391,92392,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.285,ANTONIO,"Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel"
92392,92393,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.286,ANTONIO,"Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,"
92393,92394,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.287,ANTONIO,"And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death"
92394,92395,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.288,ANTONIO,"That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse"
92395,92396,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.289,ANTONIO,Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
92396,92397,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.290,ANTONIO,"As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate"
92397,92398,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.291,ANTONIO,As amply and unnecessarily
92398,92399,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.292,ANTONIO,"As this Gonzalo, I myself could make"
92399,92400,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.293,ANTONIO,"A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore"
92400,92401,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.294,ANTONIO,The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
92401,92402,The Tempest,137.0,2.1.295,ANTONIO,For your advancement! Do you understand me?
92402,92403,The Tempest,138.0,2.1.296,SEBASTIAN,Methinks I do.
92403,92404,The Tempest,139.0,2.1.297,ANTONIO,And how does your content
92404,92405,The Tempest,139.0,2.1.298,ANTONIO,Tender your own good fortune?
92405,92406,The Tempest,140.0,2.1.299,SEBASTIAN,I remember
92406,92407,The Tempest,140.0,2.1.300,SEBASTIAN,You did supplant your brother Prospero.
92407,92408,The Tempest,141.0,2.1.301,ANTONIO,True:
92408,92409,The Tempest,141.0,2.1.302,ANTONIO,"And look how well my garments sit upon me,"
92409,92410,The Tempest,141.0,2.1.303,ANTONIO,Much feater than before: my brother's servants
92410,92411,The Tempest,141.0,2.1.304,ANTONIO,"Were then my fellows, now they are my men."
92411,92412,The Tempest,142.0,2.1.305,SEBASTIAN,"But, for your conscience?"
92412,92413,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.306,ANTONIO,"Ay, sir, where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,"
92413,92414,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.307,ANTONIO,'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
92414,92415,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.308,ANTONIO,"This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,"
92415,92416,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.309,ANTONIO,"That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they"
92416,92417,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.310,ANTONIO,"And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,"
92417,92418,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.311,ANTONIO,"No better than the earth he lies upon,"
92418,92419,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.312,ANTONIO,"If he were that which now he's like, that's dead,"
92419,92420,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.313,ANTONIO,"Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,"
92420,92421,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.314,ANTONIO,"Can lay to bed for ever, whiles you, doing thus,"
92421,92422,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.315,ANTONIO,To the perpetual wink for aye might put
92422,92423,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.316,ANTONIO,"This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who"
92423,92424,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.317,ANTONIO,"Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,"
92424,92425,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.318,ANTONIO,"They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk,"
92425,92426,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.319,ANTONIO,They'll tell the clock to any business that
92426,92427,The Tempest,143.0,2.1.320,ANTONIO,We say befits the hour.
92427,92428,The Tempest,144.0,2.1.321,SEBASTIAN,"Thy case, dear friend,"
92428,92429,The Tempest,144.0,2.1.322,SEBASTIAN,"Shall be my precedent, as thou got'st Milan,"
92429,92430,The Tempest,144.0,2.1.323,SEBASTIAN,I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
92430,92431,The Tempest,144.0,2.1.324,SEBASTIAN,"Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,"
92431,92432,The Tempest,144.0,2.1.325,SEBASTIAN,And I the king shall love thee.
92432,92433,The Tempest,145.0,2.1.326,ANTONIO,"Draw together,"
92433,92434,The Tempest,145.0,2.1.327,ANTONIO,"And when I rear my hand, do you the like,"
92434,92435,The Tempest,145.0,2.1.328,ANTONIO,To fall it on Gonzalo.
92435,92436,The Tempest,146.0,2.1.329,SEBASTIAN,"O, but one word."
92436,92437,The Tempest,146.0,,SEBASTIAN,They talk apart
92437,92438,The Tempest,146.0,,SEBASTIAN,"Re-enter ARIEL, invisible"
92438,92439,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.330,ARIEL,My master through his art foresees the danger
92439,92440,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.331,ARIEL,"That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth--"
92440,92441,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.332,ARIEL,For else his project dies--to keep them living.
92441,92442,The Tempest,147.0,,ARIEL,Sings in GONZALO's ear
92442,92443,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.333,ARIEL,"While you here do snoring lie,"
92443,92444,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.334,ARIEL,Open-eyed conspiracy
92444,92445,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.335,ARIEL,His time doth take.
92445,92446,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.336,ARIEL,"If of life you keep a care,"
92446,92447,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.337,ARIEL,"Shake off slumber, and beware:"
92447,92448,The Tempest,147.0,2.1.338,ARIEL,"Awake, awake!"
92448,92449,The Tempest,148.0,2.1.339,ANTONIO,Then let us both be sudden.
92449,92450,The Tempest,149.0,2.1.340,GONZALO,"Now, good angels"
92450,92451,The Tempest,149.0,2.1.341,GONZALO,Preserve the king.
92451,92452,The Tempest,149.0,,GONZALO,They wake
92452,92453,The Tempest,150.0,2.1.342,ALONSO,"Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?"
92453,92454,The Tempest,150.0,2.1.343,ALONSO,Wherefore this ghastly looking?
92454,92455,The Tempest,151.0,2.1.344,GONZALO,What's the matter?
92455,92456,The Tempest,152.0,2.1.345,SEBASTIAN,"Whiles we stood here securing your repose,"
92456,92457,The Tempest,152.0,2.1.346,SEBASTIAN,"Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing"
92457,92458,The Tempest,152.0,2.1.347,SEBASTIAN,"Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?"
92458,92459,The Tempest,152.0,2.1.348,SEBASTIAN,It struck mine ear most terribly.
92459,92460,The Tempest,153.0,2.1.349,ALONSO,I heard nothing.
92460,92461,The Tempest,154.0,2.1.350,ANTONIO,"O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,"
92461,92462,The Tempest,154.0,2.1.351,ANTONIO,"To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar"
92462,92463,The Tempest,154.0,2.1.352,ANTONIO,Of a whole herd of lions.
92463,92464,The Tempest,155.0,2.1.353,ALONSO,"Heard you this, Gonzalo?"
92464,92465,The Tempest,156.0,2.1.354,GONZALO,"Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,"
92465,92466,The Tempest,156.0,2.1.355,GONZALO,"And that a strange one too, which did awake me:"
92466,92467,The Tempest,156.0,2.1.356,GONZALO,"I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,"
92467,92468,The Tempest,156.0,2.1.357,GONZALO,"I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,"
92468,92469,The Tempest,156.0,2.1.358,GONZALO,"That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,"
92469,92470,The Tempest,156.0,2.1.359,GONZALO,"Or that we quit this place, let's draw our weapons."
92470,92471,The Tempest,157.0,2.1.360,ALONSO,"Lead off this ground, and let's make further search"
92471,92472,The Tempest,157.0,2.1.361,ALONSO,For my poor son.
92472,92473,The Tempest,158.0,2.1.362,GONZALO,Heavens keep him from these beasts!
92473,92474,The Tempest,158.0,2.1.363,GONZALO,"For he is, sure, i' the island."
92474,92475,The Tempest,159.0,2.1.364,ALONSO,Lead away.
92475,92476,The Tempest,160.0,2.1.365,ARIEL,Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
92476,92477,The Tempest,160.0,2.1.366,ARIEL,"So, king, go safely on to seek thy son."
92477,92478,The Tempest,160.0,,ARIEL,Exeunt
92478,92479,The Tempest,160.0,,ARIEL,SCENE II. Another part of the island.
92479,92480,The Tempest,160.0,,ARIEL,Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard
92480,92481,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.1,CALIBAN,All the infections that the sun sucks up
92481,92482,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.2,CALIBAN,"From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him"
92482,92483,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.3,CALIBAN,By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
92483,92484,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.4,CALIBAN,"And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,"
92484,92485,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.5,CALIBAN,"Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,"
92485,92486,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.6,CALIBAN,"Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark"
92486,92487,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.7,CALIBAN,"Out of my way, unless he bid 'em, but"
92487,92488,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.8,CALIBAN,"For every trifle are they set upon me,"
92488,92489,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.9,CALIBAN,Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
92489,92490,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.10,CALIBAN,"And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which"
92490,92491,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.11,CALIBAN,Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
92491,92492,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.12,CALIBAN,"Their pricks at my footfall, sometime am I"
92492,92493,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.13,CALIBAN,All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
92493,92494,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.14,CALIBAN,Do hiss me into madness.
92494,92495,The Tempest,1.0,,CALIBAN,Enter TRINCULO
92495,92496,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.15,CALIBAN,"Lo, now, lo!"
92496,92497,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.16,CALIBAN,"Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me"
92497,92498,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.17,CALIBAN,"For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat,"
92498,92499,The Tempest,1.0,2.2.18,CALIBAN,Perchance he will not mind me.
92499,92500,The Tempest,2.0,2.2.19,TRINCULO,"Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off"
92500,92501,The Tempest,2.0,2.2.20,TRINCULO,"any weather at all, and another storm brewing,"
92501,92502,The Tempest,2.0,2.2.21,TRINCULO,I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
92502,92503,The Tempest,2.0,2.2.22,TRINCULO,"cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul"
92503,92504,The Tempest,2.0,2.2.23,TRINCULO,bombard that would shed his liquor. If it

92687,92688,The Tempest,1.0,3.1.9,FERDINAND,And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
92688,92689,The Tempest,1.0,3.1.10,FERDINAND,"Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,"
92689,92690,The Tempest,1.0,3.1.11,FERDINAND,Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress

92770,92771,The Tempest,18.0,3.1.91,FERDINAND,Wherefore weep you?
92771,92772,The Tempest,19.0,3.1.92,MIRANDA,At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
92772,92773,The Tempest,19.0,3.1.93,MIRANDA,"What I desire to give, and much less take"
92773,92774,The Tempest,19.0,3.1.94,MIRANDA,"What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,"
92774,92775,The Tempest,19.0,3.1.95,MIRANDA,"And all the more it seeks to hide itself,"
92775,92776,The Tempest,19.0,3.1.96,MIRANDA,"The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!"
92776,92777,The Tempest,19.0,3.1.97,MIRANDA,"And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!"
92777,92778,The Tempest,19.0,3.1.98,MIRANDA,"I am your wife, if you will marry me,"

92801,92802,The Tempest,2.0,3.2.4,TRINCULO,Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
92802,92803,The Tempest,2.0,3.2.5,TRINCULO,say there's but five upon this isle: we are three

92806,92807,The Tempest,3.0,3.2.9,STEPHANO,are almost set in thy head.
92807,92808,The Tempest,4.0,3.2.10,TRINCULO,Where should they be set else? he were a brave
92808,92809,The Tempest,4.0,3.2.11,TRINCULO,"monster indeed, if they were set in his tail."
92809,92810,The Tempest,5.0,3.2.12,STEPHANO,My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:

92814,92815,The Tempest,6.0,3.2.17,TRINCULO,"Your lieutenant, if you list, he's no standard."
92815,92816,The Tempest,7.0,3.2.18,STEPHANO,"We'll not run, Monsieur Monster."

92853,92854,The Tempest,27.0,3.2.55,STEPHANO,How now shall this be compassed?
92854,92855,The Tempest,27.0,3.2.56,STEPHANO,Canst thou bring me to the party?
92855,92856,The Tempest,28.0,3.2.57,CALIBAN,"Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,"
92856,92857,The Tempest,28.0,3.2.58,CALIBAN,Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.

92873,92874,The Tempest,35.0,3.2.74,STEPHANO,"As you like this, give me the lie another time."
92874,92875,The Tempest,36.0,3.2.75,TRINCULO,I did not give the lie. Out o' your
92875,92876,The Tempest,36.0,3.2.76,TRINCULO,wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
92876,92877,The Tempest,36.0,3.2.77,TRINCULO,this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
92877,92878,The Tempest,36.0,3.2.78,TRINCULO,"your monster, and the devil take your fingers!"
92878,92879,The Tempest,37.0,3.2.79,CALIBAN,"Ha, ha, ha!"
92879,92880,The Tempest,38.0,3.2.80,STEPHANO,"Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther"
92880,92881,The Tempest,38.0,3.2.81,STEPHANO,off.
92881,92882,The Tempest,39.0,3.2.82,CALIBAN,Beat him enough: after a little time
92882,92883,The Tempest,39.0,3.2.83,CALIBAN,I'll beat him too.
92883,92884,The Tempest,40.0,3.2.84,STEPHANO,"Stand farther. Come, proceed."
92884,92885,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.85,CALIBAN,"Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,"
92885,92886,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.86,CALIBAN,"I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,"
92886,92887,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.87,CALIBAN,"Having first seized his books, or with a log"
92887,92888,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.88,CALIBAN,"Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,"
92888,92889,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.89,CALIBAN,Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
92889,92890,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.90,CALIBAN,"First to possess his books, for without them"
92890,92891,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.91,CALIBAN,"He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not"
92891,92892,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.92,CALIBAN,One spirit to command: they all do hate him
92892,92893,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.93,CALIBAN,As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
92893,92894,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.94,CALIBAN,"He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--"
92894,92895,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.95,CALIBAN,"Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal"
92895,92896,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.96,CALIBAN,And that most deeply to consider is
92896,92897,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.97,CALIBAN,"The beauty of his daughter, he himself"
92897,92898,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.98,CALIBAN,"Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,"
92898,92899,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.99,CALIBAN,"But only Sycorax my dam and she,"
92899,92900,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.100,CALIBAN,But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
92900,92901,The Tempest,41.0,3.2.101,CALIBAN,As great'st does least.
92901,92902,The Tempest,42.0,3.2.102,STEPHANO,Is it so brave a lass?
92902,92903,The Tempest,43.0,3.2.103,CALIBAN,"Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant."
92903,92904,The Tempest,43.0,3.2.104,CALIBAN,And bring thee forth brave brood.
92904,92905,The Tempest,44.0,3.2.105,STEPHANO,"Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I"
92905,92906,The Tempest,44.0,3.2.106,STEPHANO,will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
92906,92907,The Tempest,44.0,3.2.107,STEPHANO,Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
92907,92908,The Tempest,44.0,3.2.108,STEPHANO,"like the plot, Trinculo?"
92908,92909,The Tempest,45.0,3.2.109,TRINCULO,Excellent.
92909,92910,The Tempest,46.0,3.2.110,STEPHANO,"Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee, but,"
92910,92911,The Tempest,46.0,3.2.111,STEPHANO,"while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head."
92911,92912,The Tempest,47.0,3.2.112,CALIBAN,Within this half hour will he be asleep:
92912,92913,The Tempest,47.0,3.2.113,CALIBAN,Wilt thou destroy him then?
92913,92914,The Tempest,48.0,3.2.114,STEPHANO,"Ay, on mine honour."
92914,92915,The Tempest,49.0,3.2.115,ARIEL,This will I tell my master.
92915,92916,The Tempest,50.0,3.2.116,CALIBAN,"Thou makest me merry, I am full of pleasure:"
92916,92917,The Tempest,50.0,3.2.117,CALIBAN,Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
92917,92918,The Tempest,50.0,3.2.118,CALIBAN,You taught me but while-ere?
92918,92919,The Tempest,51.0,3.2.119,STEPHANO,"At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any"
92919,92920,The Tempest,51.0,3.2.120,STEPHANO,"reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing."
92920,92921,The Tempest,51.0,,STEPHANO,Sings
92921,92922,The Tempest,51.0,3.2.121,STEPHANO,Flout 'em and scout 'em
92922,92923,The Tempest,51.0,3.2.122,STEPHANO,And scout 'em and flout 'em
92923,92924,The Tempest,51.0,3.2.123,STEPHANO,Thought is free.
92924,92925,The Tempest,52.0,3.2.124,CALIBAN,That's not the tune.
92925,92926,The Tempest,52.0,,CALIBAN,Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
92926,92927,The Tempest,53.0,3.2.125,STEPHANO,What is this same?
92927,92928,The Tempest,54.0,3.2.126,TRINCULO,"This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture"
92928,92929,The Tempest,54.0,3.2.127,TRINCULO,of Nobody.
92929,92930,The Tempest,55.0,3.2.128,STEPHANO,"If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:"
92930,92931,The Tempest,55.0,3.2.129,STEPHANO,"if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list."
92931,92932,The Tempest,56.0,3.2.130,TRINCULO,"O, forgive me my sins!"
92932,92933,The Tempest,57.0,3.2.131,STEPHANO,He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
92933,92934,The Tempest,58.0,3.2.132,CALIBAN,Art thou afeard?
92934,92935,The Tempest,59.0,3.2.133,STEPHANO,"No, monster, not I."
92935,92936,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.134,CALIBAN,"Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises,"
92936,92937,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.135,CALIBAN,"Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not."
92937,92938,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.136,CALIBAN,Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
92938,92939,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.137,CALIBAN,"Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices"
92939,92940,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.138,CALIBAN,"That, if I then had waked after long sleep,"
92940,92941,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.139,CALIBAN,"Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,"
92941,92942,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.140,CALIBAN,The clouds methought would open and show riches
92942,92943,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.141,CALIBAN,"Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,"
92943,92944,The Tempest,60.0,3.2.142,CALIBAN,I cried to dream again.
92944,92945,The Tempest,61.0,3.2.143,STEPHANO,"This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall"
92945,92946,The Tempest,61.0,3.2.144,STEPHANO,have my music for nothing.
92946,92947,The Tempest,62.0,3.2.145,CALIBAN,When Prospero is destroyed.
92947,92948,The Tempest,63.0,3.2.146,STEPHANO,That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
92948,92949,The Tempest,64.0,3.2.147,TRINCULO,"The sound is going away, let's follow it, and"
92949,92950,The Tempest,64.0,3.2.148,TRINCULO,after do our work.
92950,92951,The Tempest,65.0,3.2.149,STEPHANO,"Lead, monster, we'll follow. I would I could see"
92951,92952,The Tempest,65.0,3.2.150,STEPHANO,"this tabourer, he lays it on."
92952,92953,The Tempest,66.0,3.2.151,TRINCULO,"Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano."
92953,92954,The Tempest,66.0,,TRINCULO,Exeunt
92954,92955,The Tempest,66.0,,TRINCULO,SCENE III. Another part of the island.
92955,92956,The Tempest,66.0,,TRINCULO,"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others"
92956,92957,The Tempest,1.0,3.3.1,GONZALO,"By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir,"
92957,92958,The Tempest,1.0,3.3.2,GONZALO,My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
92958,92959,The Tempest,1.0,3.3.3,GONZALO,"Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,"
92959,92960,The Tempest,1.0,3.3.4,GONZALO,I needs must rest me.
92960,92961,The Tempest,2.0,3.3.5,ALONSO,"Old lord, I cannot blame thee,"
92961,92962,The Tempest,2.0,3.3.6,ALONSO,"Who am myself attach'd with weariness,"
92962,92963,The Tempest,2.0,3.3.7,ALONSO,"To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest."
92963,92964,The Tempest,2.0,3.3.8,ALONSO,Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
92964,92965,The Tempest,2.0,3.3.9,ALONSO,No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
92965,92966,The Tempest,2.0,3.3.10,ALONSO,"Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks"
92966,92967,The Tempest,2.0,3.3.11,ALONSO,"Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go."
92967,92968,The Tempest,3.0,3.3.12,ANTONIO,[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so
92968,92969,The Tempest,3.0,3.3.13,ANTONIO,out of hope.
92969,92970,The Tempest,3.0,3.3.14,ANTONIO,"Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose"
92970,92971,The Tempest,3.0,3.3.15,ANTONIO,That you resolved to effect.
92971,92972,The Tempest,4.0,3.3.16,SEBASTIAN,[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage
92972,92973,The Tempest,4.0,3.3.17,SEBASTIAN,Will we take throughly.
92973,92974,The Tempest,5.0,3.3.18,ANTONIO,"[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night,"
92974,92975,The Tempest,5.0,3.3.19,ANTONIO,"For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they"
92975,92976,The Tempest,5.0,3.3.20,ANTONIO,"Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance"
92976,92977,The Tempest,5.0,3.3.21,ANTONIO,As when they are fresh.
92977,92978,The Tempest,6.0,3.3.22,SEBASTIAN,"[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more."
92978,92979,The Tempest,6.0,,SEBASTIAN,Solemn and strange music
92979,92980,The Tempest,7.0,3.3.23,ALONSO,"What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!"
92980,92981,The Tempest,8.0,3.3.24,GONZALO,Marvellous sweet music!
92981,92982,The Tempest,8.0,3.3.24,GONZALO,"Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several  strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet,  they dance about it with gentle actions of  salutation, and, inviting the King,  and c. to eat, they depart"
92982,92983,The Tempest,9.0,3.3.25,ALONSO,"Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?"
92983,92984,The Tempest,10.0,3.3.26,SEBASTIAN,A living drollery. Now I will believe
92984,92985,The Tempest,10.0,3.3.27,SEBASTIAN,"That there are unicorns, that in Arabia"
92985,92986,The Tempest,10.0,3.3.28,SEBASTIAN,"There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix"
92986,92987,The Tempest,10.0,3.3.29,SEBASTIAN,At this hour reigning there.
92987,92988,The Tempest,11.0,3.3.30,ANTONIO,"I'll believe both,"
92988,92989,The Tempest,11.0,3.3.31,ANTONIO,"And what does else want credit, come to me,"
92989,92990,The Tempest,11.0,3.3.32,ANTONIO,And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
92990,92991,The Tempest,11.0,3.3.33,ANTONIO,"lie,"
92991,92992,The Tempest,11.0,3.3.34,ANTONIO,Though fools at home condemn 'em.
92992,92993,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.35,GONZALO,If in Naples
92993,92994,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.36,GONZALO,"I should report this now, would they believe me?"
92994,92995,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.37,GONZALO,"If I should say, I saw such islanders--"
92995,92996,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.38,GONZALO,"For, certes, these are people of the island--"
92996,92997,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.39,GONZALO,"Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,"
92997,92998,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.40,GONZALO,Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
92998,92999,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.41,GONZALO,Our human generation you shall find
92999,93000,The Tempest,12.0,3.3.42,GONZALO,"Many, nay, almost any."
93000,93001,The Tempest,13.0,3.3.43,PROSPERO,"[Aside]              Honest lord,"
93001,93002,The Tempest,13.0,3.3.44,PROSPERO,"Thou hast said well, for some of you there present"
93002,93003,The Tempest,13.0,3.3.45,PROSPERO,Are worse than devils.
93003,93004,The Tempest,14.0,3.3.46,ALONSO,I cannot too much muse
93004,93005,The Tempest,14.0,3.3.47,ALONSO,"Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,"
93005,93006,The Tempest,14.0,3.3.48,ALONSO,"Although they want the use of tongue, a kind"
93006,93007,The Tempest,14.0,3.3.49,ALONSO,Of excellent dumb discourse.

93010,93011,The Tempest,17.0,3.3.53,SEBASTIAN,"They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs."
93011,93012,The Tempest,17.0,3.3.54,SEBASTIAN,Will't please you taste of what is here?
93012,93013,The Tempest,18.0,3.3.55,ALONSO,Not I.
93013,93014,The Tempest,19.0,3.3.56,GONZALO,"Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,"
93014,93015,The Tempest,19.0,3.3.57,GONZALO,Who would believe that there were mountaineers
93015,93016,The Tempest,19.0,3.3.58,GONZALO,"Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em"
93016,93017,The Tempest,19.0,3.3.59,GONZALO,Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
93017,93018,The Tempest,19.0,3.3.60,GONZALO,Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
93018,93019,The Tempest,19.0,3.3.61,GONZALO,Each putter-out of five for one will bring us

93245,93246,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.142,IRIS,"With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,"
93246,93247,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.143,IRIS,Leave your crisp channels and on this green land

93248,93249,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.145,IRIS,"Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate"
93249,93250,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.146,IRIS,"A contract of true love, be not too late."
93250,93251,The Tempest,29.0,,IRIS,Enter certain Nymphs
93251,93252,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.147,IRIS,"You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,"
93252,93253,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.148,IRIS,Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
93253,93254,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.149,IRIS,"Make holiday, your rye-straw hats put on"
93254,93255,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.150,IRIS,And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
93255,93256,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.151,IRIS,In country footing.
93256,93257,The Tempest,29.0,4.1.151,IRIS,"Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they  join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance,  towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts  suddenly, and speaks, after which, to a  strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish"
93257,93258,The Tempest,30.0,4.1.152,PROSPERO,[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy
93258,93259,The Tempest,30.0,4.1.153,PROSPERO,Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
93259,93260,The Tempest,30.0,4.1.154,PROSPERO,Against my life: the minute of their plot

93263,93264,The Tempest,31.0,4.1.157,FERDINAND,This is strange: your father's in some passion
93264,93265,The Tempest,31.0,4.1.158,FERDINAND,That works him strongly.
93265,93266,The Tempest,32.0,4.1.159,MIRANDA,Never till this day

93267,93268,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.161,PROSPERO,"You do look, my son, in a moved sort,"
93268,93269,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.162,PROSPERO,"As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir."
93269,93270,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.163,PROSPERO,"Our revels now are ended. These our actors,"

93274,93275,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.168,PROSPERO,"The solemn temples, the great globe itself,"
93275,93276,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.169,PROSPERO,"Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve"
93276,93277,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.170,PROSPERO,"And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,"
93277,93278,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.171,PROSPERO,Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
93278,93279,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.172,PROSPERO,"As dreams are made on, and our little life"
93279,93280,The Tempest,33.0,4.1.173,PROSPERO,"Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd,"

93285,93286,The Tempest,35.0,4.1.179,MIRANDA,We wish your peace.

93294,93295,The Tempest,39.0,4.1.186,ARIEL,Lest I might anger thee.
93295,93296,The Tempest,40.0,4.1.187,PROSPERO,"Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?"
93296,93297,The Tempest,41.0,4.1.188,ARIEL,"I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,"
93297,93298,The Tempest,41.0,4.1.189,ARIEL,So fun of valour that they smote the air
93298,93299,The Tempest,41.0,4.1.190,ARIEL,"For breathing in their faces, beat the ground"

93306,93307,The Tempest,41.0,4.1.198,ARIEL,"Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,"
93307,93308,The Tempest,41.0,4.1.199,ARIEL,Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them

93426,93427,The Tempest,6.0,5.1.23,ARIEL,"Mine would, sir, were I human."
93427,93428,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.24,PROSPERO,And mine shall.
93428,93429,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.25,PROSPERO,"Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling"
93429,93430,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.26,PROSPERO,"Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,"
93430,93431,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.27,PROSPERO,"One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,"
93431,93432,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.28,PROSPERO,"Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?"
93432,93433,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.29,PROSPERO,"Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,"
93433,93434,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.30,PROSPERO,Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
93434,93435,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.31,PROSPERO,Do I take part: the rarer action is
93435,93436,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.32,PROSPERO,"In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,"
93436,93437,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.33,PROSPERO,The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
93437,93438,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.34,PROSPERO,"Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:"
93438,93439,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.35,PROSPERO,"My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,"
93439,93440,The Tempest,7.0,5.1.36,PROSPERO,And they shall be themselves.
93440,93441,The Tempest,8.0,5.1.37,ARIEL,"I'll fetch them, sir."
93441,93442,The Tempest,8.0,,ARIEL,Exit
93442,93443,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.38,PROSPERO,"Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,"
93443,93444,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.39,PROSPERO,And ye that on the sands with printless foot
93444,93445,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.40,PROSPERO,Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
93445,93446,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.41,PROSPERO,"When he comes back, you demi-puppets that"
93446,93447,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.42,PROSPERO,"By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,"
93447,93448,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.43,PROSPERO,"Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime"
93448,93449,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.44,PROSPERO,"Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice"
93449,93450,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.45,PROSPERO,"To hear the solemn curfew, by whose aid,"
93450,93451,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.46,PROSPERO,"Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd"
93451,93452,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.47,PROSPERO,"The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,"
93452,93453,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.48,PROSPERO,And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
93453,93454,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.49,PROSPERO,Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
93454,93455,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.50,PROSPERO,Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
93455,93456,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.51,PROSPERO,"With his own bolt, the strong-based promontory"
93456,93457,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.52,PROSPERO,Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
93457,93458,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.53,PROSPERO,The pine and cedar: graves at my command
93458,93459,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.54,PROSPERO,"Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth"
93459,93460,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.55,PROSPERO,By my so potent art. But this rough magic
93460,93461,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.56,PROSPERO,"I here abjure, and, when I have required"
93461,93462,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.57,PROSPERO,"Some heavenly music, which even now I do,"
93462,93463,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.58,PROSPERO,To work mine end upon their senses that
93463,93464,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.59,PROSPERO,"This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,"
93464,93465,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.60,PROSPERO,"Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,"
93465,93466,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.61,PROSPERO,And deeper than did ever plummet sound
93466,93467,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.62,PROSPERO,I'll drown my book.
93467,93468,The Tempest,9.0,,PROSPERO,Solemn music
93468,93469,The Tempest,9.0,,PROSPERO,"Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO,  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed, which PROSPERO observing, speaks:"
93469,93470,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.63,PROSPERO,A solemn air and the best comforter
93470,93471,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.64,PROSPERO,"To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,"
93471,93472,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.65,PROSPERO,"Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,"
93472,93473,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.66,PROSPERO,For you are spell-stopp'd.
93473,93474,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.67,PROSPERO,"Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,"
93474,93475,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.68,PROSPERO,"Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,"
93475,93476,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.69,PROSPERO,"Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,"
93476,93477,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.70,PROSPERO,"And as the morning steals upon the night,"
93477,93478,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.71,PROSPERO,"Melting the darkness, so their rising senses"
93478,93479,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.72,PROSPERO,Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
93479,93480,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.73,PROSPERO,"Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,"
93480,93481,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.74,PROSPERO,"My true preserver, and a loyal sir"
93481,93482,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.75,PROSPERO,To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
93482,93483,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.76,PROSPERO,Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
93483,93484,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.77,PROSPERO,"Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:"
93484,93485,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.78,PROSPERO,Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
93485,93486,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.79,PROSPERO,"Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,"
93486,93487,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.80,PROSPERO,"You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,"
93487,93488,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.81,PROSPERO,"Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian,"
93488,93489,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.82,PROSPERO,"Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,"
93489,93490,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.83,PROSPERO,"Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,"
93490,93491,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.84,PROSPERO,Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
93491,93492,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.85,PROSPERO,"Begins to swell, and the approaching tide"
93492,93493,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.86,PROSPERO,Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
93493,93494,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.87,PROSPERO,That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
93494,93495,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.88,PROSPERO,"That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,"
93495,93496,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.89,PROSPERO,Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
93496,93497,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.90,PROSPERO,"I will discase me, and myself present"
93497,93498,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.91,PROSPERO,"As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit,"
93498,93499,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.92,PROSPERO,Thou shalt ere long be free.
93499,93500,The Tempest,9.0,,PROSPERO,ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
93500,93501,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.93,PROSPERO,Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
93501,93502,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.94,PROSPERO,"In a cowslip's bell I lie,"
93502,93503,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.95,PROSPERO,There I couch when owls do cry.
93503,93504,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.96,PROSPERO,On the bat's back I do fly
93504,93505,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.97,PROSPERO,After summer merrily.
93505,93506,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.98,PROSPERO,"Merrily, merrily shall I live now"
93506,93507,The Tempest,9.0,5.1.99,PROSPERO,Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
93507,93508,The Tempest,10.0,5.1.100,PROSPERO,"Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:"
93508,93509,The Tempest,10.0,5.1.101,PROSPERO,"But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so."
93509,93510,The Tempest,10.0,5.1.102,PROSPERO,"To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:"
93510,93511,The Tempest,10.0,5.1.103,PROSPERO,There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
93511,93512,The Tempest,10.0,5.1.104,PROSPERO,"Under the hatches, the master and the boatswain"
93512,93513,The Tempest,10.0,5.1.105,PROSPERO,"Being awake, enforce them to this place,"
93513,93514,The Tempest,10.0,5.1.106,PROSPERO,"And presently, I prithee."
93514,93515,The Tempest,11.0,5.1.107,ARIEL,"I drink the air before me, and return"
93515,93516,The Tempest,11.0,5.1.108,ARIEL,Or ere your pulse twice beat.
93516,93517,The Tempest,11.0,,ARIEL,Exit
93517,93518,The Tempest,12.0,5.1.109,GONZALO,"All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement"
93518,93519,The Tempest,12.0,5.1.110,GONZALO,Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
93519,93520,The Tempest,12.0,5.1.111,GONZALO,Out of this fearful country!
93520,93521,The Tempest,13.0,5.1.112,PROSPERO,"Behold, sir king,"
93521,93522,The Tempest,13.0,5.1.113,PROSPERO,"The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:"
93522,93523,The Tempest,13.0,5.1.114,PROSPERO,For more assurance that a living prince
93523,93524,The Tempest,13.0,5.1.115,PROSPERO,"Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,"
93524,93525,The Tempest,13.0,5.1.116,PROSPERO,And to thee and thy company I bid
93525,93526,The Tempest,13.0,5.1.117,PROSPERO,A hearty welcome.
93526,93527,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.118,ALONSO,"Whether thou best he or no,"
93527,93528,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.119,ALONSO,"Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,"
93528,93529,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.120,ALONSO,"As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse"
93529,93530,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.121,ALONSO,"Beats as of flesh and blood, and, since I saw thee,"
93530,93531,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.122,ALONSO,"The affliction of my mind amends, with which,"
93531,93532,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.123,ALONSO,"I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,"
93532,93533,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.124,ALONSO,"An if this be at all, a most strange story."
93533,93534,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.125,ALONSO,Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
93534,93535,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.126,ALONSO,Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
93535,93536,The Tempest,14.0,5.1.127,ALONSO,Be living and be here?
93536,93537,The Tempest,15.0,5.1.128,PROSPERO,"First, noble friend,"
93537,93538,The Tempest,15.0,5.1.129,PROSPERO,"Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot"
93538,93539,The Tempest,15.0,5.1.130,PROSPERO,Be measured or confined.
93539,93540,The Tempest,16.0,5.1.131,GONZALO,Whether this be
93540,93541,The Tempest,16.0,5.1.132,GONZALO,"Or be not, I'll not swear."
93541,93542,The Tempest,17.0,5.1.133,PROSPERO,You do yet taste
93542,93543,The Tempest,17.0,5.1.134,PROSPERO,"Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you"
93543,93544,The Tempest,17.0,5.1.135,PROSPERO,"Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!"
93544,93545,The Tempest,17.0,,PROSPERO,Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
93545,93546,The Tempest,17.0,5.1.136,PROSPERO,"But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,"
93546,93547,The Tempest,17.0,5.1.137,PROSPERO,I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
93547,93548,The Tempest,17.0,5.1.138,PROSPERO,And justify you traitors: at this time
93548,93549,The Tempest,17.0,5.1.139,PROSPERO,I will tell no tales.
93549,93550,The Tempest,18.0,5.1.140,SEBASTIAN,[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
93550,93551,The Tempest,19.0,5.1.141,PROSPERO,No.
93551,93552,The Tempest,19.0,5.1.142,PROSPERO,"For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother"
93552,93553,The Tempest,19.0,5.1.143,PROSPERO,"Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive"
93553,93554,The Tempest,19.0,5.1.144,PROSPERO,"Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require"
93554,93555,The Tempest,19.0,5.1.145,PROSPERO,"My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,"
93555,93556,The Tempest,19.0,5.1.146,PROSPERO,Thou must restore.
93556,93557,The Tempest,20.0,5.1.147,ALONSO,"If thou be'st Prospero,"
93557,93558,The Tempest,20.0,5.1.148,ALONSO,"Give us particulars of thy preservation,"
93558,93559,The Tempest,20.0,5.1.149,ALONSO,"How thou hast met us here, who three hours since"
93559,93560,The Tempest,20.0,5.1.150,ALONSO,"Were wreck'd upon this shore, where I have lost--"
93560,93561,The Tempest,20.0,5.1.151,ALONSO,How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
93561,93562,The Tempest,20.0,5.1.152,ALONSO,My dear son Ferdinand.
93562,93563,The Tempest,21.0,5.1.153,PROSPERO,"I am woe for't, sir."
93563,93564,The Tempest,22.0,5.1.154,ALONSO,"Irreparable is the loss, and patience"
93564,93565,The Tempest,22.0,5.1.155,ALONSO,Says it is past her cure.
93565,93566,The Tempest,23.0,5.1.156,PROSPERO,I rather think
93566,93567,The Tempest,23.0,5.1.157,PROSPERO,"You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace"
93567,93568,The Tempest,23.0,5.1.158,PROSPERO,For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
93568,93569,The Tempest,23.0,5.1.159,PROSPERO,And rest myself content.
93569,93570,The Tempest,24.0,5.1.160,ALONSO,You the like loss!
93570,93571,The Tempest,25.0,5.1.161,PROSPERO,"As great to me as late, and, supportable"
93571,93572,The Tempest,25.0,5.1.162,PROSPERO,"To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker"
93572,93573,The Tempest,25.0,5.1.163,PROSPERO,"Than you may call to comfort you, for I"
93573,93574,The Tempest,25.0,5.1.164,PROSPERO,Have lost my daughter.
93574,93575,The Tempest,26.0,5.1.165,ALONSO,A daughter?
93575,93576,The Tempest,26.0,5.1.166,ALONSO,"O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,"
93576,93577,The Tempest,26.0,5.1.167,ALONSO,"The king and queen there! that they were, I wish"
93577,93578,The Tempest,26.0,5.1.168,ALONSO,Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
93578,93579,The Tempest,26.0,5.1.169,ALONSO,Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
93579,93580,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.170,PROSPERO,In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
93580,93581,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.171,PROSPERO,At this encounter do so much admire
93581,93582,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.172,PROSPERO,That they devour their reason and scarce think
93582,93583,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.173,PROSPERO,"Their eyes do offices of truth, their words"
93583,93584,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.174,PROSPERO,"Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have"
93584,93585,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.175,PROSPERO,"Been justled from your senses, know for certain"
93585,93586,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.176,PROSPERO,That I am Prospero and that very duke
93586,93587,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.177,PROSPERO,"Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely"
93587,93588,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.178,PROSPERO,"Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,"
93588,93589,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.179,PROSPERO,"To be the lord on't. No more yet of this,"
93589,93590,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.180,PROSPERO,"For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,"
93590,93591,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.181,PROSPERO,Not a relation for a breakfast nor
93591,93592,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.182,PROSPERO,"Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir,"
93592,93593,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.183,PROSPERO,This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
93593,93594,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.184,PROSPERO,"And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in."
93594,93595,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.185,PROSPERO,"My dukedom since you have given me again,"
93595,93596,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.186,PROSPERO,"I will requite you with as good a thing,"
93596,93597,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.187,PROSPERO,"At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye"
93597,93598,The Tempest,27.0,5.1.188,PROSPERO,As much as me my dukedom.
93598,93599,The Tempest,27.0,,PROSPERO,Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess
93599,93600,The Tempest,28.0,5.1.189,MIRANDA,"Sweet lord, you play me false."
93600,93601,The Tempest,29.0,5.1.190,FERDINAND,"No, my dear'st love,"
93601,93602,The Tempest,29.0,5.1.191,FERDINAND,I would not for the world.
93602,93603,The Tempest,30.0,5.1.192,MIRANDA,"Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,"
93603,93604,The Tempest,30.0,5.1.193,MIRANDA,"And I would call it, fair play."
93604,93605,The Tempest,31.0,5.1.194,ALONSO,If this prove
93605,93606,The Tempest,31.0,5.1.195,ALONSO,"A vision of the Island, one dear son"
93606,93607,The Tempest,31.0,5.1.196,ALONSO,Shall I twice lose.
93607,93608,The Tempest,32.0,5.1.197,SEBASTIAN,A most high miracle!
93608,93609,The Tempest,33.0,5.1.198,FERDINAND,"Though the seas threaten, they are merciful,"
93609,93610,The Tempest,33.0,5.1.199,FERDINAND,I have cursed them without cause.
93610,93611,The Tempest,33.0,,FERDINAND,Kneels
93611,93612,The Tempest,34.0,5.1.200,ALONSO,Now all the blessings

93613,93614,The Tempest,34.0,5.1.202,ALONSO,"Arise, and say how thou camest here."
93614,93615,The Tempest,35.0,5.1.203,MIRANDA,"O, wonder!"
93615,93616,The Tempest,35.0,5.1.204,MIRANDA,How many goodly creatures are there here!
93616,93617,The Tempest,35.0,5.1.205,MIRANDA,"How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,"
93617,93618,The Tempest,35.0,5.1.206,MIRANDA,That has such people in't!
93618,93619,The Tempest,36.0,5.1.207,PROSPERO,'Tis new to thee.
93619,93620,The Tempest,37.0,5.1.208,ALONSO,What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
93620,93621,The Tempest,37.0,5.1.209,ALONSO,Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
93621,93622,The Tempest,37.0,5.1.210,ALONSO,"Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,"
93622,93623,The Tempest,37.0,5.1.211,ALONSO,And brought us thus together?
93623,93624,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.212,FERDINAND,"Sir, she is mortal,"
93624,93625,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.213,FERDINAND,But by immortal Providence she's mine:
93625,93626,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.214,FERDINAND,I chose her when I could not ask my father
93626,93627,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.215,FERDINAND,"For his advice, nor thought I had one. She"
93627,93628,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.216,FERDINAND,"Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,"
93628,93629,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.217,FERDINAND,"Of whom so often I have heard renown,"
93629,93630,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.218,FERDINAND,"But never saw before, of whom I have"
93630,93631,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.219,FERDINAND,"Received a second life, and second father"
93631,93632,The Tempest,38.0,5.1.220,FERDINAND,This lady makes him to me.
93632,93633,The Tempest,39.0,5.1.221,ALONSO,I am hers:
93633,93634,The Tempest,39.0,5.1.222,ALONSO,"But, O, how oddly will it sound that I"
93634,93635,The Tempest,39.0,5.1.223,ALONSO,Must ask my child forgiveness!
93635,93636,The Tempest,40.0,5.1.224,PROSPERO,"There, sir, stop:"
93636,93637,The Tempest,40.0,5.1.225,PROSPERO,Let us not burthen our remembrance with
93637,93638,The Tempest,40.0,5.1.226,PROSPERO,A heaviness that's gone.
93638,93639,The Tempest,41.0,5.1.227,GONZALO,"I have inly wept,"
93639,93640,The Tempest,41.0,5.1.228,GONZALO,"Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,"
93640,93641,The Tempest,41.0,5.1.229,GONZALO,And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
93641,93642,The Tempest,41.0,5.1.230,GONZALO,For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
93642,93643,The Tempest,41.0,5.1.231,GONZALO,Which brought us hither.
93643,93644,The Tempest,42.0,5.1.232,ALONSO,"I say, Amen, Gonzalo!"
93644,93645,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.233,GONZALO,"Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue"
93645,93646,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.234,GONZALO,"Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice"
93646,93647,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.235,GONZALO,"Beyond a common joy, and set it down"
93647,93648,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.236,GONZALO,With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
93648,93649,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.237,GONZALO,"Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,"
93649,93650,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.238,GONZALO,"And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife"
93650,93651,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.239,GONZALO,"Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom"
93651,93652,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.240,GONZALO,In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
93652,93653,The Tempest,43.0,5.1.241,GONZALO,When no man was his own.
93653,93654,The Tempest,44.0,5.1.242,ALONSO,[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:
93654,93655,The Tempest,44.0,5.1.243,ALONSO,Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
93655,93656,The Tempest,44.0,5.1.244,ALONSO,That doth not wish you joy!
93656,93657,The Tempest,45.0,5.1.245,GONZALO,Be it so! Amen!
93657,93658,The Tempest,45.0,,GONZALO,"Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following"
93658,93659,The Tempest,45.0,5.1.246,GONZALO,"O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:"
93659,93660,The Tempest,45.0,5.1.247,GONZALO,"I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,"
93660,93661,The Tempest,45.0,5.1.248,GONZALO,"This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,"
93661,93662,The Tempest,45.0,5.1.249,GONZALO,"That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?"
93662,93663,The Tempest,45.0,5.1.250,GONZALO,Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
93663,93664,The Tempest,46.0,5.1.251,Boatswain,"The best news is, that we have safely found"
93664,93665,The Tempest,46.0,5.1.252,Boatswain,"Our king and company, the next, our ship--"
93665,93666,The Tempest,46.0,5.1.253,Boatswain,"Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--"
93666,93667,The Tempest,46.0,5.1.254,Boatswain,Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
93667,93668,The Tempest,46.0,5.1.255,Boatswain,We first put out to sea.
93668,93669,The Tempest,47.0,5.1.256,ARIEL,"[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service"
93669,93670,The Tempest,47.0,5.1.257,ARIEL,Have I done since I went.
93670,93671,The Tempest,48.0,5.1.258,PROSPERO,[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
93671,93672,The Tempest,49.0,5.1.259,ALONSO,"These are not natural events, they strengthen"
93672,93673,The Tempest,49.0,5.1.260,ALONSO,"From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?"
93673,93674,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.261,Boatswain,"If I did think, sir, I were well awake,"
93674,93675,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.262,Boatswain,"I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,"
93675,93676,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.263,Boatswain,"And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches,"
93676,93677,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.264,Boatswain,Where but even now with strange and several noises
93677,93678,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.265,Boatswain,"Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,"
93678,93679,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.266,Boatswain,"And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,"
93679,93680,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.267,Boatswain,"We were awaked, straightway, at liberty,"
93680,93681,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.268,Boatswain,"Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld"
93681,93682,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.269,Boatswain,"Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master"
93682,93683,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.270,Boatswain,"Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,"
93683,93684,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.271,Boatswain,"Even in a dream, were we divided from them"
93684,93685,The Tempest,50.0,5.1.272,Boatswain,And were brought moping hither.
93685,93686,The Tempest,51.0,5.1.273,ARIEL,[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?
93686,93687,The Tempest,52.0,5.1.274,PROSPERO,"[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free."
93687,93688,The Tempest,53.0,5.1.275,ALONSO,This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
93688,93689,The Tempest,53.0,5.1.276,ALONSO,And there is in this business more than nature
93689,93690,The Tempest,53.0,5.1.277,ALONSO,Was ever conduct of: some oracle
93690,93691,The Tempest,53.0,5.1.278,ALONSO,Must rectify our knowledge.
93691,93692,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.279,PROSPERO,"Sir, my liege,"
93692,93693,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.280,PROSPERO,Do not infest your mind with beating on
93693,93694,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.281,PROSPERO,"The strangeness of this business, at pick'd leisure"
93694,93695,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.282,PROSPERO,"Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,"
93695,93696,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.283,PROSPERO,"Which to you shall seem probable, of every"
93696,93697,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.284,PROSPERO,"These happen'd accidents, till when, be cheerful"
93697,93698,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.285,PROSPERO,And think of each thing well.

93699,93700,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.286,PROSPERO,"Come hither, spirit:"
93700,93701,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.287,PROSPERO,"Set Caliban and his companions free,"
93701,93702,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.288,PROSPERO,Untie the spell.
93702,93703,The Tempest,54.0,,PROSPERO,Exit ARIEL
93703,93704,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.289,PROSPERO,How fares my gracious sir?
93704,93705,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.290,PROSPERO,There are yet missing of your company
93705,93706,The Tempest,54.0,5.1.291,PROSPERO,Some few odd lads that you remember not.
93706,93707,The Tempest,54.0,,PROSPERO,"Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel"
93707,93708,The Tempest,55.0,5.1.292,STEPHANO,"Every man shift for all the rest, and"
93708,93709,The Tempest,55.0,5.1.293,STEPHANO,"let no man take care for himself, for all is"
93709,93710,The Tempest,55.0,5.1.294,STEPHANO,"but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!"
93710,93711,The Tempest,56.0,5.1.295,TRINCULO,"If these be true spies which I wear in my head,"
93711,93712,The Tempest,56.0,5.1.296,TRINCULO,here's a goodly sight.
93712,93713,The Tempest,57.0,5.1.297,CALIBAN,"O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!"
93713,93714,The Tempest,57.0,5.1.298,CALIBAN,How fine my master is! I am afraid
93714,93715,The Tempest,57.0,5.1.299,CALIBAN,He will chastise me.
93715,93716,The Tempest,58.0,5.1.300,SEBASTIAN,"Ha, ha!"
93716,93717,The Tempest,58.0,5.1.301,SEBASTIAN,"What things are these, my lord Antonio?"
93717,93718,The Tempest,58.0,5.1.302,SEBASTIAN,Will money buy 'em?
93718,93719,The Tempest,59.0,5.1.303,ANTONIO,"Very like, one of them"
93719,93720,The Tempest,59.0,5.1.304,ANTONIO,"Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable."
93720,93721,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.305,PROSPERO,"Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,"
93721,93722,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.306,PROSPERO,"Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,"
93722,93723,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.307,PROSPERO,"His mother was a witch, and one so strong"
93723,93724,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.308,PROSPERO,"That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,"
93724,93725,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.309,PROSPERO,And deal in her command without her power.
93725,93726,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.310,PROSPERO,"These three have robb'd me, and this demi-devil--"
93726,93727,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.311,PROSPERO,For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
93727,93728,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.312,PROSPERO,To take my life. Two of these fellows you
93728,93729,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.313,PROSPERO,"Must know and own, this thing of darkness!"
93729,93730,The Tempest,60.0,5.1.314,PROSPERO,Acknowledge mine.
93730,93731,The Tempest,61.0,5.1.315,CALIBAN,I shall be pinch'd to death.
93731,93732,The Tempest,62.0,5.1.316,ALONSO,"Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?"
93732,93733,The Tempest,63.0,5.1.317,SEBASTIAN,He is drunk now: where had he wine?
93733,93734,The Tempest,64.0,5.1.318,ALONSO,And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
93734,93735,The Tempest,64.0,5.1.319,ALONSO,Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
93735,93736,The Tempest,64.0,5.1.320,ALONSO,How camest thou in this pickle?
93736,93737,The Tempest,65.0,5.1.321,TRINCULO,I have been in such a pickle since I

93740,93741,The Tempest,67.0,5.1.325,STEPHANO,"O, touch me not, I am not Stephano, but a cramp."
93741,93742,The Tempest,68.0,5.1.326,PROSPERO,"You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?"
93742,93743,The Tempest,69.0,5.1.327,STEPHANO,I should have been a sore one then.
93743,93744,The Tempest,70.0,5.1.328,ALONSO,This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
93744,93745,The Tempest,70.0,,ALONSO,Pointing to Caliban
93745,93746,The Tempest,71.0,5.1.329,PROSPERO,He is as disproportion'd in his manners
93746,93747,The Tempest,71.0,5.1.330,PROSPERO,"As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell,"

93750,93751,The Tempest,72.0,5.1.334,CALIBAN,And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
93751,93752,The Tempest,72.0,5.1.335,CALIBAN,"Was I, to take this drunkard for a god"
93752,93753,The Tempest,72.0,5.1.336,CALIBAN,And worship this dull fool!

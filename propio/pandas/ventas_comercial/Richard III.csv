81340,81341,Richard III,11.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,ACT I
81341,81342,Richard III,11.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,SCENE I. London. A street.
81342,81343,Richard III,11.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Enter GLOUCESTER, solus"
81343,81344,Richard III,1.0,1.1.1,GLOUCESTER,Now is the winter of our discontent
81344,81345,Richard III,1.0,1.1.2,GLOUCESTER,"Made glorious summer by this sun of York,"
81345,81346,Richard III,1.0,1.1.3,GLOUCESTER,And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
81346,81347,Richard III,1.0,1.1.4,GLOUCESTER,In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
81347,81348,Richard III,1.0,1.1.5,GLOUCESTER,"Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,"
81348,81349,Richard III,1.0,1.1.6,GLOUCESTER,"Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,"
81349,81350,Richard III,1.0,1.1.7,GLOUCESTER,"Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,"
81350,81351,Richard III,1.0,1.1.8,GLOUCESTER,Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
81351,81352,Richard III,1.0,1.1.9,GLOUCESTER,"Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,"
81352,81353,Richard III,1.0,1.1.10,GLOUCESTER,"And now, instead of mounting barded steeds"
81353,81354,Richard III,1.0,1.1.11,GLOUCESTER,"To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,"
81354,81355,Richard III,1.0,1.1.12,GLOUCESTER,He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
81355,81356,Richard III,1.0,1.1.13,GLOUCESTER,To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
81356,81357,Richard III,1.0,1.1.14,GLOUCESTER,"But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,"
81357,81358,Richard III,1.0,1.1.15,GLOUCESTER,"Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass,"
81358,81359,Richard III,1.0,1.1.16,GLOUCESTER,"I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty"
81359,81360,Richard III,1.0,1.1.17,GLOUCESTER,"To strut before a wanton ambling nymph,"
81360,81361,Richard III,1.0,1.1.18,GLOUCESTER,"I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,"
81361,81362,Richard III,1.0,1.1.19,GLOUCESTER,"Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,"
81362,81363,Richard III,1.0,1.1.20,GLOUCESTER,"Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time"
81363,81364,Richard III,1.0,1.1.21,GLOUCESTER,"Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,"
81364,81365,Richard III,1.0,1.1.22,GLOUCESTER,And that so lamely and unfashionable
81365,81366,Richard III,1.0,1.1.23,GLOUCESTER,"That dogs bark at me as I halt by them,"
81366,81367,Richard III,1.0,1.1.24,GLOUCESTER,"Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,"
81367,81368,Richard III,1.0,1.1.25,GLOUCESTER,"Have no delight to pass away the time,"
81368,81369,Richard III,1.0,1.1.26,GLOUCESTER,Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
81369,81370,Richard III,1.0,1.1.27,GLOUCESTER,And descant on mine own deformity:
81370,81371,Richard III,1.0,1.1.28,GLOUCESTER,"And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,"
81371,81372,Richard III,1.0,1.1.29,GLOUCESTER,"To entertain these fair well-spoken days,"
81372,81373,Richard III,1.0,1.1.30,GLOUCESTER,I am determined to prove a villain
81373,81374,Richard III,1.0,1.1.31,GLOUCESTER,And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
81374,81375,Richard III,1.0,1.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,"
81375,81376,Richard III,1.0,1.1.33,GLOUCESTER,"By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,"
81376,81377,Richard III,1.0,1.1.34,GLOUCESTER,To set my brother Clarence and the king
81377,81378,Richard III,1.0,1.1.35,GLOUCESTER,In deadly hate the one against the other:
81378,81379,Richard III,1.0,1.1.36,GLOUCESTER,And if King Edward be as true and just
81379,81380,Richard III,1.0,1.1.37,GLOUCESTER,"As I am subtle, false and treacherous,"
81380,81381,Richard III,1.0,1.1.38,GLOUCESTER,"This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,"
81381,81382,Richard III,1.0,1.1.39,GLOUCESTER,"About a prophecy, which says that 'G'"
81382,81383,Richard III,1.0,1.1.40,GLOUCESTER,Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
81383,81384,Richard III,1.0,1.1.41,GLOUCESTER,"Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here"
81384,81385,Richard III,1.0,1.1.42,GLOUCESTER,Clarence comes.
81385,81386,Richard III,1.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY"
81386,81387,Richard III,1.0,1.1.43,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, good day, what means this armed guard"
81387,81388,Richard III,1.0,1.1.44,GLOUCESTER,That waits upon your grace?
81388,81389,Richard III,2.0,1.1.45,CLARENCE,His majesty
81389,81390,Richard III,2.0,1.1.46,CLARENCE,"Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed"
81390,81391,Richard III,2.0,1.1.47,CLARENCE,This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
81391,81392,Richard III,3.0,1.1.48,GLOUCESTER,Upon what cause?
81392,81393,Richard III,4.0,1.1.49,CLARENCE,Because my name is George.
81393,81394,Richard III,5.0,1.1.50,GLOUCESTER,"Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours,"
81394,81395,Richard III,5.0,1.1.51,GLOUCESTER,"He should, for that, commit your godfathers:"
81395,81396,Richard III,5.0,1.1.52,GLOUCESTER,"O, belike his majesty hath some intent"
81396,81397,Richard III,5.0,1.1.53,GLOUCESTER,That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
81397,81398,Richard III,5.0,1.1.54,GLOUCESTER,"But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?"
81398,81399,Richard III,6.0,1.1.55,CLARENCE,"Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest"
81399,81400,Richard III,6.0,1.1.56,CLARENCE,"As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,"
81400,81401,Richard III,6.0,1.1.57,CLARENCE,"He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,"
81401,81402,Richard III,6.0,1.1.58,CLARENCE,And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
81402,81403,Richard III,6.0,1.1.59,CLARENCE,And says a wizard told him that by G
81403,81404,Richard III,6.0,1.1.60,CLARENCE,"His issue disinherited should be,"
81404,81405,Richard III,6.0,1.1.61,CLARENCE,"And, for my name of George begins with G,"
81405,81406,Richard III,6.0,1.1.62,CLARENCE,It follows in his thought that I am he.
81406,81407,Richard III,6.0,1.1.63,CLARENCE,"These, as I learn, and such like toys as these"
81407,81408,Richard III,6.0,1.1.64,CLARENCE,Have moved his highness to commit me now.
81408,81409,Richard III,7.0,1.1.65,GLOUCESTER,"Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:"
81409,81410,Richard III,7.0,1.1.66,GLOUCESTER,'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
81410,81411,Richard III,7.0,1.1.67,GLOUCESTER,"My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she"
81411,81412,Richard III,7.0,1.1.68,GLOUCESTER,That tempers him to this extremity.
81412,81413,Richard III,7.0,1.1.69,GLOUCESTER,"Was it not she and that good man of worship,"
81413,81414,Richard III,7.0,1.1.70,GLOUCESTER,"Anthony Woodville, her brother there,"
81414,81415,Richard III,7.0,1.1.71,GLOUCESTER,"That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,"
81415,81416,Richard III,7.0,1.1.72,GLOUCESTER,From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
81416,81417,Richard III,7.0,1.1.73,GLOUCESTER,"We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe."
81417,81418,Richard III,8.0,1.1.74,CLARENCE,"By heaven, I think there's no man is secure"
81418,81419,Richard III,8.0,1.1.75,CLARENCE,But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
81419,81420,Richard III,8.0,1.1.76,CLARENCE,That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
81420,81421,Richard III,8.0,1.1.77,CLARENCE,Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
81421,81422,Richard III,8.0,1.1.78,CLARENCE,Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
81422,81423,Richard III,9.0,1.1.79,GLOUCESTER,Humbly complaining to her deity
81423,81424,Richard III,9.0,1.1.80,GLOUCESTER,Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
81424,81425,Richard III,9.0,1.1.81,GLOUCESTER,"I'll tell you what, I think it is our way,"
81425,81426,Richard III,9.0,1.1.82,GLOUCESTER,"If we will keep in favour with the king,"
81426,81427,Richard III,9.0,1.1.83,GLOUCESTER,To be her men and wear her livery:
81427,81428,Richard III,9.0,1.1.84,GLOUCESTER,"The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,"
81428,81429,Richard III,9.0,1.1.85,GLOUCESTER,Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
81429,81430,Richard III,9.0,1.1.86,GLOUCESTER,Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
81430,81431,Richard III,10.0,1.1.87,BRAKENBURY,"I beseech your graces both to pardon me,"
81431,81432,Richard III,10.0,1.1.88,BRAKENBURY,His majesty hath straitly given in charge
81432,81433,Richard III,10.0,1.1.89,BRAKENBURY,"That no man shall have private conference,"
81433,81434,Richard III,10.0,1.1.90,BRAKENBURY,"Of what degree soever, with his brother."
81434,81435,Richard III,11.0,1.1.91,GLOUCESTER,"Even so, an't please your worship, Brakenbury,"
81435,81436,Richard III,11.0,1.1.92,GLOUCESTER,You may partake of any thing we say:
81436,81437,Richard III,11.0,1.1.93,GLOUCESTER,"We speak no treason, man: we say the king"
81437,81438,Richard III,11.0,1.1.94,GLOUCESTER,"Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen"
81438,81439,Richard III,11.0,1.1.95,GLOUCESTER,"Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous,"
81439,81440,Richard III,11.0,1.1.96,GLOUCESTER,"We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,"
81440,81441,Richard III,11.0,1.1.97,GLOUCESTER,"A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,"
81441,81442,Richard III,11.0,1.1.98,GLOUCESTER,And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
81442,81443,Richard III,11.0,1.1.99,GLOUCESTER,How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
81443,81444,Richard III,12.0,1.1.100,BRAKENBURY,"With this, my lord, myself have nought to do."
81444,81445,Richard III,13.0,1.1.101,GLOUCESTER,"Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,"
81445,81446,Richard III,13.0,1.1.102,GLOUCESTER,"He that doth naught with her, excepting one,"
81446,81447,Richard III,13.0,1.1.103,GLOUCESTER,"Were best he do it secretly, alone."
81447,81448,Richard III,14.0,1.1.104,BRAKENBURY,"What one, my lord?"
81448,81449,Richard III,15.0,1.1.105,GLOUCESTER,"Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?"
81449,81450,Richard III,16.0,1.1.106,BRAKENBURY,"I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal"
81450,81451,Richard III,16.0,1.1.107,BRAKENBURY,Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
81451,81452,Richard III,17.0,1.1.108,CLARENCE,"We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey."
81452,81453,Richard III,18.0,1.1.109,GLOUCESTER,"We are the queen's abjects, and must obey."
81453,81454,Richard III,18.0,1.1.110,GLOUCESTER,"Brother, farewell: I will unto the king,"
81454,81455,Richard III,18.0,1.1.111,GLOUCESTER,"And whatsoever you will employ me in,"
81455,81456,Richard III,18.0,1.1.112,GLOUCESTER,"Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,"
81456,81457,Richard III,18.0,1.1.113,GLOUCESTER,I will perform it to enfranchise you.
81457,81458,Richard III,18.0,1.1.114,GLOUCESTER,"Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood"
81458,81459,Richard III,18.0,1.1.115,GLOUCESTER,Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
81459,81460,Richard III,19.0,1.1.116,CLARENCE,I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
81460,81461,Richard III,20.0,1.1.117,GLOUCESTER,"Well, your imprisonment shall not be long,"
81461,81462,Richard III,20.0,1.1.118,GLOUCESTER,"Meantime, have patience."
81462,81463,Richard III,21.0,1.1.119,CLARENCE,I must perforce. Farewell.
81463,81464,Richard III,21.0,,CLARENCE,"Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard"
81464,81465,Richard III,22.0,1.1.120,GLOUCESTER,"Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return."
81465,81466,Richard III,22.0,1.1.121,GLOUCESTER,"Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,"
81466,81467,Richard III,22.0,1.1.122,GLOUCESTER,"That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,"
81467,81468,Richard III,22.0,1.1.123,GLOUCESTER,If heaven will take the present at our hands.
81468,81469,Richard III,22.0,1.1.124,GLOUCESTER,But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
81469,81470,Richard III,22.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter HASTINGS
81470,81471,Richard III,23.0,1.1.125,HASTINGS,Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
81471,81472,Richard III,24.0,1.1.126,GLOUCESTER,As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
81472,81473,Richard III,24.0,1.1.127,GLOUCESTER,Well are you welcome to the open air.
81473,81474,Richard III,24.0,1.1.128,GLOUCESTER,How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
81474,81475,Richard III,25.0,1.1.129,HASTINGS,"With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:"
81475,81476,Richard III,25.0,1.1.130,HASTINGS,"But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks"
81476,81477,Richard III,25.0,1.1.131,HASTINGS,That were the cause of my imprisonment.
81477,81478,Richard III,26.0,1.1.132,GLOUCESTER,"No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too,"
81478,81479,Richard III,26.0,1.1.133,GLOUCESTER,"For they that were your enemies are his,"
81479,81480,Richard III,26.0,1.1.134,GLOUCESTER,And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
81480,81481,Richard III,27.0,1.1.135,HASTINGS,"More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,"
81481,81482,Richard III,27.0,1.1.136,HASTINGS,While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
81482,81483,Richard III,28.0,1.1.137,GLOUCESTER,What news abroad?
81483,81484,Richard III,29.0,1.1.138,HASTINGS,"No news so bad abroad as this at home,"
81484,81485,Richard III,29.0,1.1.139,HASTINGS,"The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,"
81485,81486,Richard III,29.0,1.1.140,HASTINGS,And his physicians fear him mightily.
81486,81487,Richard III,30.0,1.1.141,GLOUCESTER,"Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed."
81487,81488,Richard III,30.0,1.1.142,GLOUCESTER,"O, he hath kept an evil diet long,"
81488,81489,Richard III,30.0,1.1.143,GLOUCESTER,And overmuch consumed his royal person:
81489,81490,Richard III,30.0,1.1.144,GLOUCESTER,'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
81490,81491,Richard III,30.0,1.1.145,GLOUCESTER,"What, is he in his bed?"
81491,81492,Richard III,31.0,1.1.146,HASTINGS,He is.
81492,81493,Richard III,32.0,1.1.147,GLOUCESTER,"Go you before, and I will follow you."
81493,81494,Richard III,32.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit HASTINGS
81494,81495,Richard III,32.0,1.1.148,GLOUCESTER,"He cannot live, I hope, and must not die"
81495,81496,Richard III,32.0,1.1.149,GLOUCESTER,Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
81496,81497,Richard III,32.0,1.1.150,GLOUCESTER,"I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,"
81497,81498,Richard III,32.0,1.1.151,GLOUCESTER,"With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments,"
81498,81499,Richard III,32.0,1.1.152,GLOUCESTER,"And, if I fall not in my deep intent,"
81499,81500,Richard III,32.0,1.1.153,GLOUCESTER,Clarence hath not another day to live:
81500,81501,Richard III,32.0,1.1.154,GLOUCESTER,"Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,"
81501,81502,Richard III,32.0,1.1.155,GLOUCESTER,And leave the world for me to bustle in!
81502,81503,Richard III,32.0,1.1.156,GLOUCESTER,For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
81503,81504,Richard III,32.0,1.1.157,GLOUCESTER,What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
81504,81505,Richard III,32.0,1.1.158,GLOUCESTER,The readiest way to make the wench amends
81505,81506,Richard III,32.0,1.1.159,GLOUCESTER,Is to become her husband and her father:
81506,81507,Richard III,32.0,1.1.160,GLOUCESTER,"The which will I, not all so much for love"
81507,81508,Richard III,32.0,1.1.161,GLOUCESTER,"As for another secret close intent,"
81508,81509,Richard III,32.0,1.1.162,GLOUCESTER,By marrying her which I must reach unto.
81509,81510,Richard III,32.0,1.1.163,GLOUCESTER,But yet I run before my horse to market:
81510,81511,Richard III,32.0,1.1.164,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns:"
81511,81512,Richard III,32.0,1.1.165,GLOUCESTER,"When they are gone, then must I count my gains."
81512,81513,Richard III,32.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit
81513,81514,Richard III,32.0,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE II. The same. Another street.
81514,81515,Richard III,32.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it, LADY ANNE being the mourner"
81515,81516,Richard III,1.0,1.2.1,LADY ANNE,"Set down, set down your honourable load,"
81516,81517,Richard III,1.0,1.2.2,LADY ANNE,"If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,"
81517,81518,Richard III,1.0,1.2.3,LADY ANNE,Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
81518,81519,Richard III,1.0,1.2.4,LADY ANNE,The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
81519,81520,Richard III,1.0,1.2.5,LADY ANNE,Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
81520,81521,Richard III,1.0,1.2.6,LADY ANNE,Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
81521,81522,Richard III,1.0,1.2.7,LADY ANNE,Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
81522,81523,Richard III,1.0,1.2.8,LADY ANNE,"Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,"
81523,81524,Richard III,1.0,1.2.9,LADY ANNE,"To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,"
81524,81525,Richard III,1.0,1.2.10,LADY ANNE,"Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,"
81525,81526,Richard III,1.0,1.2.11,LADY ANNE,Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
81526,81527,Richard III,1.0,1.2.12,LADY ANNE,"Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,"
81527,81528,Richard III,1.0,1.2.13,LADY ANNE,I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
81528,81529,Richard III,1.0,1.2.14,LADY ANNE,Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
81529,81530,Richard III,1.0,1.2.15,LADY ANNE,Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
81530,81531,Richard III,1.0,1.2.16,LADY ANNE,Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
81531,81532,Richard III,1.0,1.2.17,LADY ANNE,"More direful hap betide that hated wretch,"
81532,81533,Richard III,1.0,1.2.18,LADY ANNE,"That makes us wretched by the death of thee,"
81533,81534,Richard III,1.0,1.2.19,LADY ANNE,"Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,"
81534,81535,Richard III,1.0,1.2.20,LADY ANNE,Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
81535,81536,Richard III,1.0,1.2.21,LADY ANNE,"If ever he have child, abortive be it,"
81536,81537,Richard III,1.0,1.2.22,LADY ANNE,"Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,"
81537,81538,Richard III,1.0,1.2.23,LADY ANNE,Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
81538,81539,Richard III,1.0,1.2.24,LADY ANNE,"May fright the hopeful mother at the view,"
81539,81540,Richard III,1.0,1.2.25,LADY ANNE,And that be heir to his unhappiness!
81540,81541,Richard III,1.0,1.2.26,LADY ANNE,"If ever he have wife, let her he made"
81541,81542,Richard III,1.0,1.2.27,LADY ANNE,A miserable by the death of him
81542,81543,Richard III,1.0,1.2.28,LADY ANNE,As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
81543,81544,Richard III,1.0,1.2.29,LADY ANNE,"Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,"
81544,81545,Richard III,1.0,1.2.30,LADY ANNE,"Taken from Paul's to be interred there,"
81545,81546,Richard III,1.0,1.2.31,LADY ANNE,"And still, as you are weary of the weight,"
81546,81547,Richard III,1.0,1.2.32,LADY ANNE,"Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse."
81547,81548,Richard III,1.0,,LADY ANNE,Enter GLOUCESTER
81548,81549,Richard III,2.0,1.2.33,GLOUCESTER,"Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down."
81549,81550,Richard III,3.0,1.2.34,LADY ANNE,"What black magician conjures up this fiend,"
81550,81551,Richard III,3.0,1.2.35,LADY ANNE,To stop devoted charitable deeds?
81551,81552,Richard III,4.0,1.2.36,GLOUCESTER,"Villains, set down the corse, or, by Saint Paul,"
81552,81553,Richard III,4.0,1.2.37,GLOUCESTER,I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
81553,81554,Richard III,5.0,1.2.38,Gentleman,"My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass."
81554,81555,Richard III,6.0,1.2.39,GLOUCESTER,"Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:"
81555,81556,Richard III,6.0,1.2.40,GLOUCESTER,"Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,"
81556,81557,Richard III,6.0,1.2.41,GLOUCESTER,"Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,"
81557,81558,Richard III,6.0,1.2.42,GLOUCESTER,"And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness."
81558,81559,Richard III,7.0,1.2.43,LADY ANNE,"What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?"
81559,81560,Richard III,7.0,1.2.44,LADY ANNE,"Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,"
81560,81561,Richard III,7.0,1.2.45,LADY ANNE,And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
81561,81562,Richard III,7.0,1.2.46,LADY ANNE,"Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!"
81562,81563,Richard III,7.0,1.2.47,LADY ANNE,"Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,"
81563,81564,Richard III,7.0,1.2.48,LADY ANNE,"His soul thou canst not have, therefore be gone."
81564,81565,Richard III,8.0,1.2.49,GLOUCESTER,"Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst."
81565,81566,Richard III,9.0,1.2.50,LADY ANNE,"Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,"
81566,81567,Richard III,9.0,1.2.51,LADY ANNE,"For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,"
81567,81568,Richard III,9.0,1.2.52,LADY ANNE,Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
81568,81569,Richard III,9.0,1.2.53,LADY ANNE,"If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,"
81569,81570,Richard III,9.0,1.2.54,LADY ANNE,Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
81570,81571,Richard III,9.0,1.2.55,LADY ANNE,"O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds"
81571,81572,Richard III,9.0,1.2.56,LADY ANNE,Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
81572,81573,Richard III,9.0,1.2.57,LADY ANNE,"Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity,"
81573,81574,Richard III,9.0,1.2.58,LADY ANNE,For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
81574,81575,Richard III,9.0,1.2.59,LADY ANNE,"From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells,"
81575,81576,Richard III,9.0,1.2.60,LADY ANNE,"Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,"
81576,81577,Richard III,9.0,1.2.61,LADY ANNE,Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
81577,81578,Richard III,9.0,1.2.62,LADY ANNE,"O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!"
81578,81579,Richard III,9.0,1.2.63,LADY ANNE,"O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!"
81579,81580,Richard III,9.0,1.2.64,LADY ANNE,Either heaven with lightning strike the
81580,81581,Richard III,9.0,1.2.65,LADY ANNE,"murderer dead,"
81581,81582,Richard III,9.0,1.2.66,LADY ANNE,"Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,"
81582,81583,Richard III,9.0,1.2.67,LADY ANNE,As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
81583,81584,Richard III,9.0,1.2.68,LADY ANNE,Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
81584,81585,Richard III,10.0,1.2.69,GLOUCESTER,"Lady, you know no rules of charity,"
81585,81586,Richard III,10.0,1.2.70,GLOUCESTER,"Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses."
81586,81587,Richard III,11.0,1.2.71,LADY ANNE,"Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:"
81587,81588,Richard III,11.0,1.2.72,LADY ANNE,No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
81588,81589,Richard III,12.0,1.2.73,GLOUCESTER,"But I know none, and therefore am no beast."
81589,81590,Richard III,13.0,1.2.74,LADY ANNE,"O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!"
81590,81591,Richard III,14.0,1.2.75,GLOUCESTER,"More wonderful, when angels are so angry."
81591,81592,Richard III,14.0,1.2.76,GLOUCESTER,"Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,"
81592,81593,Richard III,14.0,1.2.77,GLOUCESTER,"Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,"
81593,81594,Richard III,14.0,1.2.78,GLOUCESTER,"By circumstance, but to acquit myself."
81594,81595,Richard III,15.0,1.2.79,LADY ANNE,"Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,"
81595,81596,Richard III,15.0,1.2.80,LADY ANNE,"For these known evils, but to give me leave,"
81596,81597,Richard III,15.0,1.2.81,LADY ANNE,"By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self."
81597,81598,Richard III,16.0,1.2.82,GLOUCESTER,"Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have"
81598,81599,Richard III,16.0,1.2.83,GLOUCESTER,Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
81599,81600,Richard III,17.0,1.2.84,LADY ANNE,"Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make"
81600,81601,Richard III,17.0,1.2.85,LADY ANNE,"No excuse current, but to hang thyself."
81601,81602,Richard III,18.0,1.2.86,GLOUCESTER,"By such despair, I should accuse myself."
81602,81603,Richard III,19.0,1.2.87,LADY ANNE,"And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused,"
81603,81604,Richard III,19.0,1.2.88,LADY ANNE,"For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,"
81604,81605,Richard III,19.0,1.2.89,LADY ANNE,Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
81605,81606,Richard III,20.0,1.2.90,GLOUCESTER,Say that I slew them not?
81606,81607,Richard III,21.0,1.2.91,LADY ANNE,"Why, then they are not dead:"
81607,81608,Richard III,21.0,1.2.92,LADY ANNE,"But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee."
81608,81609,Richard III,22.0,1.2.93,GLOUCESTER,I did not kill your husband.
81609,81610,Richard III,23.0,1.2.94,LADY ANNE,"Why, then he is alive."
81610,81611,Richard III,24.0,1.2.95,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hand."
81611,81612,Richard III,25.0,1.2.96,LADY ANNE,In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
81612,81613,Richard III,25.0,1.2.97,LADY ANNE,"Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood,"
81613,81614,Richard III,25.0,1.2.98,LADY ANNE,"The which thou once didst bend against her breast,"
81614,81615,Richard III,25.0,1.2.99,LADY ANNE,But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
81615,81616,Richard III,26.0,1.2.100,GLOUCESTER,"I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,"
81616,81617,Richard III,26.0,1.2.101,GLOUCESTER,which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
81617,81618,Richard III,27.0,1.2.102,LADY ANNE,Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
81618,81619,Richard III,27.0,1.2.103,LADY ANNE,Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
81619,81620,Richard III,27.0,1.2.104,LADY ANNE,Didst thou not kill this king?
81620,81621,Richard III,28.0,1.2.105,GLOUCESTER,I grant ye.
81621,81622,Richard III,29.0,1.2.106,LADY ANNE,"Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too"
81622,81623,Richard III,29.0,1.2.107,LADY ANNE,Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
81623,81624,Richard III,29.0,1.2.108,LADY ANNE,"O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!"
81624,81625,Richard III,30.0,1.2.109,GLOUCESTER,"The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him."
81625,81626,Richard III,31.0,1.2.110,LADY ANNE,"He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come."
81626,81627,Richard III,32.0,1.2.111,GLOUCESTER,"Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither,"
81627,81628,Richard III,32.0,1.2.112,GLOUCESTER,For he was fitter for that place than earth.
81628,81629,Richard III,33.0,1.2.113,LADY ANNE,And thou unfit for any place but hell.
81629,81630,Richard III,34.0,1.2.114,GLOUCESTER,"Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it."
81630,81631,Richard III,35.0,1.2.115,LADY ANNE,Some dungeon.
81631,81632,Richard III,36.0,1.2.116,GLOUCESTER,Your bed-chamber.
81632,81633,Richard III,37.0,1.2.117,LADY ANNE,I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
81633,81634,Richard III,38.0,1.2.118,GLOUCESTER,"So will it, madam till I lie with you."
81634,81635,Richard III,39.0,1.2.119,LADY ANNE,I hope so.
81635,81636,Richard III,40.0,1.2.120,GLOUCESTER,"I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,"
81636,81637,Richard III,40.0,1.2.121,GLOUCESTER,"To leave this keen encounter of our wits,"
81637,81638,Richard III,40.0,1.2.122,GLOUCESTER,"And fall somewhat into a slower method,"
81638,81639,Richard III,40.0,1.2.123,GLOUCESTER,Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
81639,81640,Richard III,40.0,1.2.124,GLOUCESTER,"Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,"
81640,81641,Richard III,40.0,1.2.125,GLOUCESTER,As blameful as the executioner?
81641,81642,Richard III,41.0,1.2.126,LADY ANNE,"Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect."
81642,81643,Richard III,42.0,1.2.127,GLOUCESTER,"Your beauty was the cause of that effect,"
81643,81644,Richard III,42.0,1.2.128,GLOUCESTER,Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
81644,81645,Richard III,42.0,1.2.129,GLOUCESTER,"To undertake the death of all the world,"
81645,81646,Richard III,42.0,1.2.130,GLOUCESTER,So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
81646,81647,Richard III,43.0,1.2.131,LADY ANNE,"If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,"
81647,81648,Richard III,43.0,1.2.132,LADY ANNE,These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
81648,81649,Richard III,44.0,1.2.133,GLOUCESTER,"These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck,"
81649,81650,Richard III,44.0,1.2.134,GLOUCESTER,"You should not blemish it, if I stood by:"
81650,81651,Richard III,44.0,1.2.135,GLOUCESTER,"As all the world is cheered by the sun,"
81651,81652,Richard III,44.0,1.2.136,GLOUCESTER,"So I by that, it is my day, my life."
81652,81653,Richard III,45.0,1.2.137,LADY ANNE,"Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!"
81653,81654,Richard III,46.0,1.2.138,GLOUCESTER,"Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both."
81654,81655,Richard III,47.0,1.2.139,LADY ANNE,"I would I were, to be revenged on thee."
81655,81656,Richard III,48.0,1.2.140,GLOUCESTER,"It is a quarrel most unnatural,"
81656,81657,Richard III,48.0,1.2.141,GLOUCESTER,To be revenged on him that loveth you.
81657,81658,Richard III,49.0,1.2.142,LADY ANNE,"It is a quarrel just and reasonable,"
81658,81659,Richard III,49.0,1.2.143,LADY ANNE,To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
81659,81660,Richard III,50.0,1.2.144,GLOUCESTER,"He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,"
81660,81661,Richard III,50.0,1.2.145,GLOUCESTER,Did it to help thee to a better husband.
81661,81662,Richard III,51.0,1.2.146,LADY ANNE,His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
81662,81663,Richard III,52.0,1.2.147,GLOUCESTER,He lives that loves thee better than he could.
81663,81664,Richard III,53.0,1.2.148,LADY ANNE,Name him.
81664,81665,Richard III,54.0,1.2.149,GLOUCESTER,Plantagenet.
81665,81666,Richard III,55.0,1.2.150,LADY ANNE,"Why, that was he."
81666,81667,Richard III,56.0,1.2.151,GLOUCESTER,"The selfsame name, but one of better nature."
81667,81668,Richard III,57.0,1.2.152,LADY ANNE,Where is he?
81668,81669,Richard III,58.0,1.2.153,GLOUCESTER,Here.
81669,81670,Richard III,58.0,,GLOUCESTER,She spitteth at him
81670,81671,Richard III,58.0,1.2.154,GLOUCESTER,Why dost thou spit at me?
81671,81672,Richard III,59.0,1.2.155,LADY ANNE,"Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!"
81672,81673,Richard III,60.0,1.2.156,GLOUCESTER,Never came poison from so sweet a place.
81673,81674,Richard III,61.0,1.2.157,LADY ANNE,Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
81674,81675,Richard III,61.0,1.2.158,LADY ANNE,Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
81675,81676,Richard III,62.0,1.2.159,GLOUCESTER,"Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine."
81676,81677,Richard III,63.0,1.2.160,LADY ANNE,"Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!"
81677,81678,Richard III,64.0,1.2.161,GLOUCESTER,"I would they were, that I might die at once,"
81678,81679,Richard III,64.0,1.2.162,GLOUCESTER,For now they kill me with a living death.
81679,81680,Richard III,64.0,1.2.163,GLOUCESTER,"Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,"
81680,81681,Richard III,64.0,1.2.164,GLOUCESTER,Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
81681,81682,Richard III,64.0,1.2.165,GLOUCESTER,"These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,"
81682,81683,Richard III,64.0,1.2.166,GLOUCESTER,"No, when my father York and Edward wept,"
81683,81684,Richard III,64.0,1.2.167,GLOUCESTER,To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
81684,81685,Richard III,64.0,1.2.168,GLOUCESTER,"When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him,"
81685,81686,Richard III,64.0,1.2.169,GLOUCESTER,"Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,"
81686,81687,Richard III,64.0,1.2.170,GLOUCESTER,"Told the sad story of my father's death,"
81687,81688,Richard III,64.0,1.2.171,GLOUCESTER,"And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,"
81688,81689,Richard III,64.0,1.2.172,GLOUCESTER,That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
81689,81690,Richard III,64.0,1.2.173,GLOUCESTER,Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
81690,81691,Richard III,64.0,1.2.174,GLOUCESTER,"My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear,"
81691,81692,Richard III,64.0,1.2.175,GLOUCESTER,"And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,"
81692,81693,Richard III,64.0,1.2.176,GLOUCESTER,"Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping."
81693,81694,Richard III,64.0,1.2.177,GLOUCESTER,"I never sued to friend nor enemy,"
81694,81695,Richard III,64.0,1.2.178,GLOUCESTER,"My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word,"
81695,81696,Richard III,64.0,1.2.179,GLOUCESTER,"But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,"
81696,81697,Richard III,64.0,1.2.180,GLOUCESTER,"My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak."
81697,81698,Richard III,64.0,,GLOUCESTER,She looks scornfully at him
81698,81699,Richard III,64.0,1.2.181,GLOUCESTER,"Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made"
81699,81700,Richard III,64.0,1.2.182,GLOUCESTER,"For kissing, lady, not for such contempt."
81700,81701,Richard III,64.0,1.2.183,GLOUCESTER,"If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,"
81701,81702,Richard III,64.0,1.2.184,GLOUCESTER,"Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,"
81702,81703,Richard III,64.0,1.2.185,GLOUCESTER,Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
81703,81704,Richard III,64.0,1.2.186,GLOUCESTER,"And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,"
81704,81705,Richard III,64.0,1.2.187,GLOUCESTER,"I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,"
81705,81706,Richard III,64.0,1.2.188,GLOUCESTER,And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
81706,81707,Richard III,64.0,1.2.188,GLOUCESTER,He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword
81707,81708,Richard III,64.0,1.2.189,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, do not pause, for I did kill King Henry,"
81708,81709,Richard III,64.0,1.2.190,GLOUCESTER,But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
81709,81710,Richard III,64.0,1.2.191,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, now dispatch, 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,"
81710,81711,Richard III,64.0,1.2.192,GLOUCESTER,But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
81711,81712,Richard III,64.0,,GLOUCESTER,Here she lets fall the sword
81712,81713,Richard III,64.0,1.2.193,GLOUCESTER,"Take up the sword again, or take up me."
81713,81714,Richard III,65.0,1.2.194,LADY ANNE,"Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,"
81714,81715,Richard III,65.0,1.2.195,LADY ANNE,I will not be the executioner.
81715,81716,Richard III,66.0,1.2.196,GLOUCESTER,"Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it."
81716,81717,Richard III,67.0,1.2.197,LADY ANNE,I have already.
81717,81718,Richard III,68.0,1.2.198,GLOUCESTER,"Tush, that was in thy rage:"
81718,81719,Richard III,68.0,1.2.199,GLOUCESTER,"Speak it again, and, even with the word,"
81719,81720,Richard III,68.0,1.2.200,GLOUCESTER,"That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,"
81720,81721,Richard III,68.0,1.2.201,GLOUCESTER,"Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love,"
81721,81722,Richard III,68.0,1.2.202,GLOUCESTER,To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
81722,81723,Richard III,69.0,1.2.203,LADY ANNE,I would I knew thy heart.
81723,81724,Richard III,70.0,1.2.204,GLOUCESTER,'Tis figured in my tongue.
81724,81725,Richard III,71.0,1.2.205,LADY ANNE,I fear me both are false.
81725,81726,Richard III,72.0,1.2.206,GLOUCESTER,Then never man was true.
81726,81727,Richard III,73.0,1.2.207,LADY ANNE,"Well, well, put up your sword."
81727,81728,Richard III,74.0,1.2.208,GLOUCESTER,"Say, then, my peace is made."
81728,81729,Richard III,75.0,1.2.209,LADY ANNE,That shall you know hereafter.
81729,81730,Richard III,76.0,1.2.210,GLOUCESTER,But shall I live in hope?
81730,81731,Richard III,77.0,1.2.211,LADY ANNE,"All men, I hope, live so."
81731,81732,Richard III,78.0,1.2.212,GLOUCESTER,Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
81732,81733,Richard III,79.0,1.2.213,LADY ANNE,To take is not to give.
81733,81734,Richard III,80.0,1.2.214,GLOUCESTER,"Look, how this ring encompasseth finger."
81734,81735,Richard III,80.0,1.2.215,GLOUCESTER,"Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart,"
81735,81736,Richard III,80.0,1.2.216,GLOUCESTER,"Wear both of them, for both of them are thine."
81736,81737,Richard III,80.0,1.2.217,GLOUCESTER,And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
81737,81738,Richard III,80.0,1.2.218,GLOUCESTER,"But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,"
81738,81739,Richard III,80.0,1.2.219,GLOUCESTER,Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
81739,81740,Richard III,81.0,1.2.220,LADY ANNE,What is it?
81740,81741,Richard III,82.0,1.2.221,GLOUCESTER,That it would please thee leave these sad designs
81741,81742,Richard III,82.0,1.2.222,GLOUCESTER,"To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,"
81742,81743,Richard III,82.0,1.2.223,GLOUCESTER,"And presently repair to Crosby Place,"
81743,81744,Richard III,82.0,1.2.224,GLOUCESTER,"Where, after I have solemnly interr'd"
81744,81745,Richard III,82.0,1.2.225,GLOUCESTER,"At Chertsey monastery this noble king,"
81745,81746,Richard III,82.0,1.2.226,GLOUCESTER,"And wet his grave with my repentant tears,"
81746,81747,Richard III,82.0,1.2.227,GLOUCESTER,I will with all expedient duty see you:
81747,81748,Richard III,82.0,1.2.228,GLOUCESTER,"For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,"
81748,81749,Richard III,82.0,1.2.229,GLOUCESTER,Grant me this boon.
81749,81750,Richard III,83.0,1.2.230,LADY ANNE,"With all my heart, and much it joys me too,"
81750,81751,Richard III,83.0,1.2.231,LADY ANNE,To see you are become so penitent.
81751,81752,Richard III,83.0,1.2.232,LADY ANNE,"Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me."
81752,81753,Richard III,84.0,1.2.233,GLOUCESTER,Bid me farewell.
81753,81754,Richard III,85.0,1.2.234,LADY ANNE,"'Tis more than you deserve,"
81754,81755,Richard III,85.0,1.2.235,LADY ANNE,"But since you teach me how to flatter you,"
81755,81756,Richard III,85.0,1.2.236,LADY ANNE,Imagine I have said farewell already.
81756,81757,Richard III,85.0,,LADY ANNE,"Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY"
81757,81758,Richard III,86.0,1.2.237,GLOUCESTER,"Sirs, take up the corse."
81758,81759,Richard III,87.0,1.2.238,GENTLEMEN,"Towards Chertsey, noble lord?"
81759,81760,Richard III,88.0,1.2.239,GLOUCESTER,"No, to White-Friars, there attend my coining."
81760,81761,Richard III,88.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
81761,81762,Richard III,88.0,1.2.240,GLOUCESTER,Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
81762,81763,Richard III,88.0,1.2.241,GLOUCESTER,Was ever woman in this humour won?
81763,81764,Richard III,88.0,1.2.242,GLOUCESTER,"I'll have her, but I will not keep her long."
81764,81765,Richard III,88.0,1.2.243,GLOUCESTER,"What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,"
81765,81766,Richard III,88.0,1.2.244,GLOUCESTER,"To take her in her heart's extremest hate,"
81766,81767,Richard III,88.0,1.2.245,GLOUCESTER,"With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,"
81767,81768,Richard III,88.0,1.2.246,GLOUCESTER,"The bleeding witness of her hatred by,"
81768,81769,Richard III,88.0,1.2.247,GLOUCESTER,"Having God, her conscience, and these bars"
81769,81770,Richard III,88.0,1.2.248,GLOUCESTER,"against me,"
81770,81771,Richard III,88.0,1.2.249,GLOUCESTER,"And I nothing to back my suit at all,"
81771,81772,Richard III,88.0,1.2.250,GLOUCESTER,"But the plain devil and dissembling looks,"
81772,81773,Richard III,88.0,1.2.251,GLOUCESTER,"And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!"
81773,81774,Richard III,88.0,1.2.252,GLOUCESTER,Ha!
81774,81775,Richard III,88.0,1.2.253,GLOUCESTER,"Hath she forgot already that brave prince,"
81775,81776,Richard III,88.0,1.2.254,GLOUCESTER,"Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,"
81776,81777,Richard III,88.0,1.2.255,GLOUCESTER,Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
81777,81778,Richard III,88.0,1.2.256,GLOUCESTER,"A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,"
81778,81779,Richard III,88.0,1.2.257,GLOUCESTER,"Framed in the prodigality of nature,"
81779,81780,Richard III,88.0,1.2.258,GLOUCESTER,"Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,"
81780,81781,Richard III,88.0,1.2.259,GLOUCESTER,The spacious world cannot again afford
81781,81782,Richard III,88.0,1.2.260,GLOUCESTER,"And will she yet debase her eyes on me,"
81782,81783,Richard III,88.0,1.2.261,GLOUCESTER,"That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,"
81783,81784,Richard III,88.0,1.2.262,GLOUCESTER,And made her widow to a woful bed?
81784,81785,Richard III,88.0,1.2.263,GLOUCESTER,"On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?"
81785,81786,Richard III,88.0,1.2.264,GLOUCESTER,"On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?"
81786,81787,Richard III,88.0,1.2.265,GLOUCESTER,"My dukedom to a beggarly denier,"
81787,81788,Richard III,88.0,1.2.266,GLOUCESTER,I do mistake my person all this while:
81788,81789,Richard III,88.0,1.2.267,GLOUCESTER,"Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,"
81789,81790,Richard III,88.0,1.2.268,GLOUCESTER,Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
81790,81791,Richard III,88.0,1.2.269,GLOUCESTER,"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,"
81791,81792,Richard III,88.0,1.2.270,GLOUCESTER,"And entertain some score or two of tailors,"
81792,81793,Richard III,88.0,1.2.271,GLOUCESTER,To study fashions to adorn my body:
81793,81794,Richard III,88.0,1.2.272,GLOUCESTER,"Since I am crept in favour with myself,"
81794,81795,Richard III,88.0,1.2.273,GLOUCESTER,Will maintain it with some little cost.
81795,81796,Richard III,88.0,1.2.274,GLOUCESTER,"But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,"
81796,81797,Richard III,88.0,1.2.275,GLOUCESTER,And then return lamenting to my love.
81797,81798,Richard III,88.0,1.2.276,GLOUCESTER,"Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,"
81798,81799,Richard III,88.0,1.2.277,GLOUCESTER,That I may see my shadow as I pass.
81799,81800,Richard III,88.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit
81800,81801,Richard III,88.0,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE III. The palace.
81801,81802,Richard III,88.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY"
81802,81803,Richard III,1.0,1.3.1,RIVERS,"Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty"
81803,81804,Richard III,1.0,1.3.2,RIVERS,Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
81804,81805,Richard III,2.0,1.3.3,GREY,"In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:"
81805,81806,Richard III,2.0,1.3.4,GREY,"Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,"
81806,81807,Richard III,2.0,1.3.5,GREY,And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
81807,81808,Richard III,3.0,1.3.6,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If he were dead, what would betide of me?"
81808,81809,Richard III,4.0,1.3.7,RIVERS,No other harm but loss of such a lord.
81809,81810,Richard III,5.0,1.3.8,QUEEN ELIZABETH,The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
81810,81811,Richard III,6.0,1.3.9,GREY,"The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,"
81811,81812,Richard III,6.0,1.3.10,GREY,To be your comforter when he is gone.
81812,81813,Richard III,7.0,1.3.11,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh, he is young and his minority"
81813,81814,Richard III,7.0,1.3.12,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,"
81814,81815,Richard III,7.0,1.3.13,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A man that loves not me, nor none of you."
81815,81816,Richard III,8.0,1.3.14,RIVERS,Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
81816,81817,Richard III,9.0,1.3.15,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"It is determined, not concluded yet:"
81817,81818,Richard III,9.0,1.3.16,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But so it must be, if the king miscarry."
81818,81819,Richard III,9.0,,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
81819,81820,Richard III,10.0,1.3.17,GREY,Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
81820,81821,Richard III,11.0,1.3.18,BUCKINGHAM,Good time of day unto your royal grace!
81821,81822,Richard III,12.0,1.3.19,DERBY,God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
81822,81823,Richard III,13.0,1.3.20,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby."
81823,81824,Richard III,13.0,1.3.21,QUEEN ELIZABETH,To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
81824,81825,Richard III,13.0,1.3.22,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,"
81825,81826,Richard III,13.0,1.3.23,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured"
81826,81827,Richard III,13.0,1.3.24,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
81827,81828,Richard III,14.0,1.3.25,DERBY,"I do beseech you, either not believe"
81828,81829,Richard III,14.0,1.3.26,DERBY,"The envious slanders of her false accusers,"
81829,81830,Richard III,14.0,1.3.27,DERBY,"Or, if she be accused in true report,"
81830,81831,Richard III,14.0,1.3.28,DERBY,"Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds"
81831,81832,Richard III,14.0,1.3.29,DERBY,"From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice."
81832,81833,Richard III,15.0,1.3.30,RIVERS,"Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?"
81833,81834,Richard III,16.0,1.3.31,DERBY,But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
81834,81835,Richard III,16.0,1.3.32,DERBY,Are come from visiting his majesty.
81835,81836,Richard III,17.0,1.3.33,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What likelihood of his amendment, lords?"
81836,81837,Richard III,18.0,1.3.34,BUCKINGHAM,"Madam, good hope, his grace speaks cheerfully."
81837,81838,Richard III,19.0,1.3.35,QUEEN ELIZABETH,God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
81838,81839,Richard III,20.0,1.3.36,BUCKINGHAM,"Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement"
81839,81840,Richard III,20.0,1.3.37,BUCKINGHAM,"Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,"
81840,81841,Richard III,20.0,1.3.38,BUCKINGHAM,"And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain,"
81841,81842,Richard III,20.0,1.3.39,BUCKINGHAM,And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
81842,81843,Richard III,21.0,1.3.40,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Would all were well! but that will never be
81843,81844,Richard III,21.0,1.3.41,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I fear our happiness is at the highest.
81844,81845,Richard III,21.0,,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET"
81845,81846,Richard III,22.0,1.3.42,GLOUCESTER,"They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:"
81846,81847,Richard III,22.0,1.3.43,GLOUCESTER,"Who are they that complain unto the king,"
81847,81848,Richard III,22.0,1.3.44,GLOUCESTER,"That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?"
81848,81849,Richard III,22.0,1.3.45,GLOUCESTER,"By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly"
81849,81850,Richard III,22.0,1.3.46,GLOUCESTER,That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
81850,81851,Richard III,22.0,1.3.47,GLOUCESTER,"Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,"
81851,81852,Richard III,22.0,1.3.48,GLOUCESTER,"Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,"
81852,81853,Richard III,22.0,1.3.49,GLOUCESTER,"Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,"
81853,81854,Richard III,22.0,1.3.50,GLOUCESTER,I must be held a rancorous enemy.
81854,81855,Richard III,22.0,1.3.51,GLOUCESTER,"Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,"
81855,81856,Richard III,22.0,1.3.52,GLOUCESTER,But thus his simple truth must be abused
81856,81857,Richard III,22.0,1.3.53,GLOUCESTER,"By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?"
81857,81858,Richard III,23.0,1.3.54,RIVERS,To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
81858,81859,Richard III,24.0,1.3.55,GLOUCESTER,"To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace."
81859,81860,Richard III,24.0,1.3.56,GLOUCESTER,When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
81860,81861,Richard III,24.0,1.3.57,GLOUCESTER,Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
81861,81862,Richard III,24.0,1.3.58,GLOUCESTER,"A plague upon you all! His royal person,--"
81862,81863,Richard III,24.0,1.3.59,GLOUCESTER,Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
81863,81864,Richard III,24.0,1.3.60,GLOUCESTER,"Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,"
81864,81865,Richard III,24.0,1.3.61,GLOUCESTER,But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
81865,81866,Richard III,25.0,1.3.62,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter."
81866,81867,Richard III,25.0,1.3.63,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The king, of his own royal disposition,"
81867,81868,Richard III,25.0,1.3.64,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And not provoked by any suitor else,"
81868,81869,Richard III,25.0,1.3.65,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,"
81869,81870,Richard III,25.0,1.3.66,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Which in your outward actions shows itself
81870,81871,Richard III,25.0,1.3.67,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,"
81871,81872,Richard III,25.0,1.3.68,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Makes him to send, that thereby he may gather"
81872,81873,Richard III,25.0,1.3.69,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it."
81873,81874,Richard III,26.0,1.3.70,GLOUCESTER,"I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,"
81874,81875,Richard III,26.0,1.3.71,GLOUCESTER,That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
81875,81876,Richard III,26.0,1.3.72,GLOUCESTER,Since every Jack became a gentleman
81876,81877,Richard III,26.0,1.3.73,GLOUCESTER,There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
81877,81878,Richard III,27.0,1.3.74,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Come, come, we know your meaning, brother"
81878,81879,Richard III,27.0,1.3.75,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Gloucester,"
81879,81880,Richard III,27.0,1.3.76,QUEEN ELIZABETH,You envy my advancement and my friends':
81880,81881,Richard III,27.0,1.3.77,QUEEN ELIZABETH,God grant we never may have need of you!
81881,81882,Richard III,28.0,1.3.78,GLOUCESTER,"Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:"
81882,81883,Richard III,28.0,1.3.79,GLOUCESTER,"Your brother is imprison'd by your means,"
81883,81884,Richard III,28.0,1.3.80,GLOUCESTER,"Myself disgraced, and the nobility"
81884,81885,Richard III,28.0,1.3.81,GLOUCESTER,"Held in contempt, whilst many fair promotions"
81885,81886,Richard III,28.0,1.3.82,GLOUCESTER,Are daily given to ennoble those
81886,81887,Richard III,28.0,1.3.83,GLOUCESTER,"That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble."
81887,81888,Richard III,29.0,1.3.84,QUEEN ELIZABETH,By Him that raised me to this careful height
81888,81889,Richard III,29.0,1.3.85,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,"
81889,81890,Richard III,29.0,1.3.86,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I never did incense his majesty
81890,81891,Richard III,29.0,1.3.87,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been"
81891,81892,Richard III,29.0,1.3.88,QUEEN ELIZABETH,An earnest advocate to plead for him.
81892,81893,Richard III,29.0,1.3.89,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My lord, you do me shameful injury,"
81893,81894,Richard III,29.0,1.3.90,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
81894,81895,Richard III,30.0,1.3.91,GLOUCESTER,You may deny that you were not the cause
81895,81896,Richard III,30.0,1.3.92,GLOUCESTER,Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
81896,81897,Richard III,31.0,1.3.93,RIVERS,"She may, my lord, for--"
81897,81898,Richard III,32.0,1.3.94,GLOUCESTER,"She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?"
81898,81899,Richard III,32.0,1.3.95,GLOUCESTER,"She may do more, sir, than denying that:"
81899,81900,Richard III,32.0,1.3.96,GLOUCESTER,"She may help you to many fair preferments,"
81900,81901,Richard III,32.0,1.3.97,GLOUCESTER,"And then deny her aiding hand therein,"
81901,81902,Richard III,32.0,1.3.98,GLOUCESTER,And lay those honours on your high deserts.
81902,81903,Richard III,32.0,1.3.99,GLOUCESTER,"What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--"
81903,81904,Richard III,33.0,1.3.100,RIVERS,"What, marry, may she?"
81904,81905,Richard III,34.0,1.3.101,GLOUCESTER,"What, marry, may she! marry with a king,"
81905,81906,Richard III,34.0,1.3.102,GLOUCESTER,"A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:"
81906,81907,Richard III,34.0,1.3.103,GLOUCESTER,I wis your grandam had a worser match.
81907,81908,Richard III,35.0,1.3.104,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne"
81908,81909,Richard III,35.0,1.3.105,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
81909,81910,Richard III,35.0,1.3.106,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty"
81910,81911,Richard III,35.0,1.3.107,QUEEN ELIZABETH,With those gross taunts I often have endured.
81911,81912,Richard III,35.0,1.3.108,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I had rather be a country servant-maid
81912,81913,Richard III,35.0,1.3.109,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Than a great queen, with this condition,"
81913,81914,Richard III,35.0,1.3.110,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:"
81914,81915,Richard III,35.0,,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind"
81915,81916,Richard III,35.0,1.3.111,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Small joy have I in being England's queen.
81916,81917,Richard III,36.0,1.3.112,QUEEN MARGARET,"And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!"
81917,81918,Richard III,36.0,1.3.113,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy honour, state and seat is due to me."
81918,81919,Richard III,37.0,1.3.114,GLOUCESTER,What! threat you me with telling of the king?
81919,81920,Richard III,37.0,1.3.115,GLOUCESTER,"Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said"
81920,81921,Richard III,37.0,1.3.116,GLOUCESTER,I will avouch in presence of the king:
81921,81922,Richard III,37.0,1.3.117,GLOUCESTER,I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
81922,81923,Richard III,37.0,1.3.118,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis time to speak, my pains are quite forgot."
81923,81924,Richard III,38.0,1.3.119,QUEEN MARGARET,"Out, devil! I remember them too well:"
81924,81925,Richard III,38.0,1.3.120,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,"
81925,81926,Richard III,38.0,1.3.121,QUEEN MARGARET,"And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury."
81926,81927,Richard III,39.0,1.3.122,GLOUCESTER,"Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,"
81927,81928,Richard III,39.0,1.3.123,GLOUCESTER,"I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,"
81928,81929,Richard III,39.0,1.3.124,GLOUCESTER,"A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,"
81929,81930,Richard III,39.0,1.3.125,GLOUCESTER,A liberal rewarder of his friends:
81930,81931,Richard III,39.0,1.3.126,GLOUCESTER,To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
81931,81932,Richard III,40.0,1.3.127,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yea, and much better blood than his or thine."
81932,81933,Richard III,41.0,1.3.128,GLOUCESTER,In all which time you and your husband Grey
81933,81934,Richard III,41.0,1.3.129,GLOUCESTER,"Were factious for the house of Lancaster,"
81934,81935,Richard III,41.0,1.3.130,GLOUCESTER,"And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband"
81935,81936,Richard III,41.0,1.3.131,GLOUCESTER,In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
81936,81937,Richard III,41.0,1.3.132,GLOUCESTER,"Let me put in your minds, if you forget,"
81937,81938,Richard III,41.0,1.3.133,GLOUCESTER,"What you have been ere now, and what you are,"
81938,81939,Richard III,41.0,1.3.134,GLOUCESTER,"Withal, what I have been, and what I am."
81939,81940,Richard III,42.0,1.3.135,QUEEN MARGARET,"A murderous villain, and so still thou art."
81940,81941,Richard III,43.0,1.3.136,GLOUCESTER,"Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,"
81941,81942,Richard III,43.0,1.3.137,GLOUCESTER,"Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--"
81942,81943,Richard III,44.0,1.3.138,QUEEN MARGARET,Which God revenge!
81943,81944,Richard III,45.0,1.3.139,GLOUCESTER,"To fight on Edward's party for the crown,"
81944,81945,Richard III,45.0,1.3.140,GLOUCESTER,"And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up."
81945,81946,Richard III,45.0,1.3.141,GLOUCESTER,"I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's,"
81946,81947,Richard III,45.0,1.3.142,GLOUCESTER,"Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine"
81947,81948,Richard III,45.0,1.3.143,GLOUCESTER,I am too childish-foolish for this world.
81948,81949,Richard III,46.0,1.3.144,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,"
81949,81950,Richard III,46.0,1.3.145,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
81950,81951,Richard III,47.0,1.3.146,RIVERS,"My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days"

81952,81953,Richard III,47.0,1.3.148,RIVERS,"We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:"
81953,81954,Richard III,47.0,1.3.149,RIVERS,"So should we you, if you should be our king."
81954,81955,Richard III,48.0,1.3.150,GLOUCESTER,If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
81955,81956,Richard III,48.0,1.3.151,GLOUCESTER,"Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!"
81956,81957,Richard III,49.0,1.3.152,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"As little joy, my lord, as you suppose"
81957,81958,Richard III,49.0,1.3.153,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"You should enjoy, were you this country's king,"
81958,81959,Richard III,49.0,1.3.154,QUEEN ELIZABETH,As little joy may you suppose in me.
81959,81960,Richard III,49.0,1.3.155,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I enjoy, being the queen thereof."
81960,81961,Richard III,50.0,1.3.156,QUEEN MARGARET,"A little joy enjoys the queen thereof,"
81961,81962,Richard III,50.0,1.3.157,QUEEN MARGARET,"For I am she, and altogether joyless."
81962,81963,Richard III,50.0,1.3.158,QUEEN MARGARET,I can no longer hold me patient.
81963,81964,Richard III,50.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Advancing
81964,81965,Richard III,50.0,1.3.159,QUEEN MARGARET,"Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out"
81965,81966,Richard III,50.0,1.3.160,QUEEN MARGARET,In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
81966,81967,Richard III,50.0,1.3.161,QUEEN MARGARET,Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
81967,81968,Richard III,50.0,1.3.162,QUEEN MARGARET,"If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,"
81968,81969,Richard III,50.0,1.3.163,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?"
81969,81970,Richard III,50.0,1.3.164,QUEEN MARGARET,"O gentle villain, do not turn away!"
81970,81971,Richard III,51.0,1.3.165,GLOUCESTER,"Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?"
81971,81972,Richard III,52.0,1.3.166,QUEEN MARGARET,"But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,"
81972,81973,Richard III,52.0,1.3.167,QUEEN MARGARET,That will I make before I let thee go.
81973,81974,Richard III,53.0,1.3.168,GLOUCESTER,Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
81974,81975,Richard III,54.0,1.3.169,QUEEN MARGARET,"I was, but I do find more pain in banishment"
81975,81976,Richard III,54.0,1.3.170,QUEEN MARGARET,Than death can yield me here by my abode.
81976,81977,Richard III,54.0,1.3.171,QUEEN MARGARET,"A husband and a son thou owest to me,"
81977,81978,Richard III,54.0,1.3.172,QUEEN MARGARET,"And thou a kingdom, all of you allegiance:"
81978,81979,Richard III,54.0,1.3.173,QUEEN MARGARET,"The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,"
81979,81980,Richard III,54.0,1.3.174,QUEEN MARGARET,And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
81980,81981,Richard III,55.0,1.3.175,GLOUCESTER,"The curse my noble father laid on thee,"
81981,81982,Richard III,55.0,1.3.176,GLOUCESTER,When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
81982,81983,Richard III,55.0,1.3.177,GLOUCESTER,"And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,"
81983,81984,Richard III,55.0,1.3.178,GLOUCESTER,"And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout"
81984,81985,Richard III,55.0,1.3.179,GLOUCESTER,Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
81985,81986,Richard III,55.0,1.3.180,GLOUCESTER,"His curses, then from bitterness of soul"
81986,81987,Richard III,55.0,1.3.181,GLOUCESTER,"Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee,"
81987,81988,Richard III,55.0,1.3.182,GLOUCESTER,"And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed."
81988,81989,Richard III,56.0,1.3.183,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So just is God, to right the innocent."
81989,81990,Richard III,57.0,1.3.184,HASTINGS,"O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,"
81990,81991,Richard III,57.0,1.3.185,HASTINGS,And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
81991,81992,Richard III,58.0,1.3.186,RIVERS,Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
81992,81993,Richard III,59.0,1.3.187,DORSET,No man but prophesied revenge for it.
81993,81994,Richard III,60.0,1.3.188,BUCKINGHAM,"Northumberland, then present, wept to see it."
81994,81995,Richard III,61.0,1.3.189,QUEEN MARGARET,"What were you snarling all before I came,"
81995,81996,Richard III,61.0,1.3.190,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ready to catch each other by the throat,"
81996,81997,Richard III,61.0,1.3.191,QUEEN MARGARET,And turn you all your hatred now on me?
81997,81998,Richard III,61.0,1.3.192,QUEEN MARGARET,Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
81998,81999,Richard III,61.0,1.3.193,QUEEN MARGARET,"That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,"
81999,82000,Richard III,61.0,1.3.194,QUEEN MARGARET,"Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,"
82000,82001,Richard III,61.0,1.3.195,QUEEN MARGARET,Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
82001,82002,Richard III,61.0,1.3.196,QUEEN MARGARET,Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
82002,82003,Richard III,61.0,1.3.197,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!"
82003,82004,Richard III,61.0,1.3.198,QUEEN MARGARET,"If not by war, by surfeit die your king,"
82004,82005,Richard III,61.0,1.3.199,QUEEN MARGARET,"As ours by murder, to make him a king!"
82005,82006,Richard III,61.0,1.3.200,QUEEN MARGARET,"Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,"
82006,82007,Richard III,61.0,1.3.201,QUEEN MARGARET,"For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,"
82007,82008,Richard III,61.0,1.3.202,QUEEN MARGARET,Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
82008,82009,Richard III,61.0,1.3.203,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,"
82009,82010,Richard III,61.0,1.3.204,QUEEN MARGARET,"Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!"
82010,82011,Richard III,61.0,1.3.205,QUEEN MARGARET,"Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss,"
82011,82012,Richard III,61.0,1.3.206,QUEEN MARGARET,"And see another, as I see thee now,"
82012,82013,Richard III,61.0,1.3.207,QUEEN MARGARET,"Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!"
82013,82014,Richard III,61.0,1.3.208,QUEEN MARGARET,"Long die thy happy days before thy death,"
82014,82015,Richard III,61.0,1.3.209,QUEEN MARGARET,"And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,"
82015,82016,Richard III,61.0,1.3.210,QUEEN MARGARET,"Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!"
82016,82017,Richard III,61.0,1.3.211,QUEEN MARGARET,"Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,"
82017,82018,Richard III,61.0,1.3.212,QUEEN MARGARET,"And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son"
82018,82019,Richard III,61.0,1.3.213,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,"
82019,82020,Richard III,61.0,1.3.214,QUEEN MARGARET,"That none of you may live your natural age,"
82020,82021,Richard III,61.0,1.3.215,QUEEN MARGARET,But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
82021,82022,Richard III,62.0,1.3.216,GLOUCESTER,"Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!"
82022,82023,Richard III,63.0,1.3.217,QUEEN MARGARET,"And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me."
82023,82024,Richard III,63.0,1.3.218,QUEEN MARGARET,If heaven have any grievous plague in store
82024,82025,Richard III,63.0,1.3.219,QUEEN MARGARET,"Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,"
82025,82026,Richard III,63.0,1.3.220,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,"
82026,82027,Richard III,63.0,1.3.221,QUEEN MARGARET,And then hurl down their indignation

82030,82031,Richard III,63.0,1.3.225,QUEEN MARGARET,And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
82031,82032,Richard III,63.0,1.3.226,QUEEN MARGARET,"No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,"
82032,82033,Richard III,63.0,1.3.227,QUEEN MARGARET,Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
82033,82034,Richard III,63.0,1.3.228,QUEEN MARGARET,Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
82034,82035,Richard III,63.0,1.3.229,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!"
82035,82036,Richard III,63.0,1.3.230,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
82036,82037,Richard III,63.0,1.3.231,QUEEN MARGARET,The slave of nature and the son of hell!
82037,82038,Richard III,63.0,1.3.232,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
82038,82039,Richard III,63.0,1.3.233,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
82039,82040,Richard III,63.0,1.3.234,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou rag of honour! thou detested--

82046,82047,Richard III,69.0,1.3.241,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply."
82047,82048,Richard III,69.0,1.3.242,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, let me make the period to my curse!"
82048,82049,Richard III,70.0,1.3.243,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'"
82049,82050,Richard III,71.0,1.3.244,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
82050,82051,Richard III,72.0,1.3.245,QUEEN MARGARET,"Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!"

82054,82055,Richard III,72.0,1.3.249,QUEEN MARGARET,The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
82055,82056,Richard III,72.0,1.3.250,QUEEN MARGARET,To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
82056,82057,Richard III,73.0,1.3.251,HASTINGS,"False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,"
82057,82058,Richard III,73.0,1.3.252,HASTINGS,Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
82058,82059,Richard III,74.0,1.3.253,QUEEN MARGARET,Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
82059,82060,Richard III,75.0,1.3.254,RIVERS,"Were you well served, you would be taught your duty."

82063,82064,Richard III,77.0,1.3.258,DORSET,"Dispute not with her, she is lunatic."
82064,82065,Richard III,78.0,1.3.259,QUEEN MARGARET,"Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:"
82065,82066,Richard III,78.0,1.3.260,QUEEN MARGARET,Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
82066,82067,Richard III,78.0,1.3.261,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, that your young nobility could judge"
82067,82068,Richard III,78.0,1.3.262,QUEEN MARGARET,"What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!"
82068,82069,Richard III,78.0,1.3.263,QUEEN MARGARET,"They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,"
82069,82070,Richard III,78.0,1.3.264,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces."
82070,82071,Richard III,79.0,1.3.265,GLOUCESTER,"Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess."
82071,82072,Richard III,80.0,1.3.266,DORSET,"It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me."
82072,82073,Richard III,81.0,1.3.267,GLOUCESTER,"Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,"
82073,82074,Richard III,81.0,1.3.268,GLOUCESTER,"Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,"
82074,82075,Richard III,81.0,1.3.269,GLOUCESTER,And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
82075,82076,Richard III,82.0,1.3.270,QUEEN MARGARET,"And turns the sun to shade, alas! alas!"
82076,82077,Richard III,82.0,1.3.271,QUEEN MARGARET,"Witness my son, now in the shade of death,"
82077,82078,Richard III,82.0,1.3.272,QUEEN MARGARET,Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
82078,82079,Richard III,82.0,1.3.273,QUEEN MARGARET,Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
82079,82080,Richard III,82.0,1.3.274,QUEEN MARGARET,Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
82080,82081,Richard III,82.0,1.3.275,QUEEN MARGARET,"O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!"
82081,82082,Richard III,82.0,1.3.276,QUEEN MARGARET,"As it was won with blood, lost be it so!"
82082,82083,Richard III,83.0,1.3.277,BUCKINGHAM,"Have done! for shame, if not for charity."
82083,82084,Richard III,84.0,1.3.278,QUEEN MARGARET,Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
82084,82085,Richard III,84.0,1.3.279,QUEEN MARGARET,"Uncharitably with me have you dealt,"
82085,82086,Richard III,84.0,1.3.280,QUEEN MARGARET,And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
82086,82087,Richard III,84.0,1.3.281,QUEEN MARGARET,"My charity is outrage, life my shame"
82087,82088,Richard III,84.0,1.3.282,QUEEN MARGARET,And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
82088,82089,Richard III,85.0,1.3.283,BUCKINGHAM,"Have done, have done."
82089,82090,Richard III,86.0,1.3.284,QUEEN MARGARET,"O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,"
82090,82091,Richard III,86.0,1.3.285,QUEEN MARGARET,In sign of league and amity with thee:
82091,82092,Richard III,86.0,1.3.286,QUEEN MARGARET,Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
82092,82093,Richard III,86.0,1.3.287,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,"
82093,82094,Richard III,86.0,1.3.288,QUEEN MARGARET,Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
82094,82095,Richard III,87.0,1.3.289,BUCKINGHAM,"Nor no one here, for curses never pass"
82095,82096,Richard III,87.0,1.3.290,BUCKINGHAM,The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
82096,82097,Richard III,88.0,1.3.291,QUEEN MARGARET,"I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,"
82097,82098,Richard III,88.0,1.3.292,QUEEN MARGARET,And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
82098,82099,Richard III,88.0,1.3.293,QUEEN MARGARET,"O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!"
82099,82100,Richard III,88.0,1.3.294,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look, when he fawns, he bites, and when he bites,"
82100,82101,Richard III,88.0,1.3.295,QUEEN MARGARET,His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
82101,82102,Richard III,88.0,1.3.296,QUEEN MARGARET,"Have not to do with him, beware of him,"
82102,82103,Richard III,88.0,1.3.297,QUEEN MARGARET,"Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,"
82103,82104,Richard III,88.0,1.3.298,QUEEN MARGARET,And all their ministers attend on him.
82104,82105,Richard III,89.0,1.3.299,GLOUCESTER,"What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?"
82105,82106,Richard III,90.0,1.3.300,BUCKINGHAM,"Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord."
82106,82107,Richard III,91.0,1.3.301,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?"
82107,82108,Richard III,91.0,1.3.302,QUEEN MARGARET,And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
82108,82109,Richard III,91.0,1.3.303,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, but remember this another day,"
82109,82110,Richard III,91.0,1.3.304,QUEEN MARGARET,"When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,"
82110,82111,Richard III,91.0,1.3.305,QUEEN MARGARET,And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
82111,82112,Richard III,91.0,1.3.306,QUEEN MARGARET,"Live each of you the subjects to his hate,"
82112,82113,Richard III,91.0,1.3.307,QUEEN MARGARET,"And he to yours, and all of you to God's!"
82113,82114,Richard III,91.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Exit
82114,82115,Richard III,92.0,1.3.308,HASTINGS,My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
82115,82116,Richard III,93.0,1.3.309,RIVERS,And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
82116,82117,Richard III,94.0,1.3.310,GLOUCESTER,"I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,"
82117,82118,Richard III,94.0,1.3.311,GLOUCESTER,"She hath had too much wrong, and I repent"
82118,82119,Richard III,94.0,1.3.312,GLOUCESTER,My part thereof that I have done to her.
82119,82120,Richard III,95.0,1.3.313,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I never did her any, to my knowledge."
82120,82121,Richard III,96.0,1.3.314,GLOUCESTER,But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
82121,82122,Richard III,96.0,1.3.315,GLOUCESTER,"I was too hot to do somebody good,"
82122,82123,Richard III,96.0,1.3.316,GLOUCESTER,That is too cold in thinking of it now.
82123,82124,Richard III,96.0,1.3.317,GLOUCESTER,"Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,"
82124,82125,Richard III,96.0,1.3.318,GLOUCESTER,He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
82125,82126,Richard III,96.0,1.3.319,GLOUCESTER,God pardon them that are the cause of it!
82126,82127,Richard III,97.0,1.3.320,RIVERS,"A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,"
82127,82128,Richard III,97.0,1.3.321,RIVERS,To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
82128,82129,Richard III,98.0,1.3.322,GLOUCESTER,So do I ever:
82129,82130,Richard III,98.0,,GLOUCESTER,Aside
82130,82131,Richard III,98.0,1.3.323,GLOUCESTER,being well-advised.
82131,82132,Richard III,98.0,1.3.324,GLOUCESTER,"For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself."
82132,82133,Richard III,98.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter CATESBY
82133,82134,Richard III,99.0,1.3.325,CATESBY,"Madam, his majesty doth call for you,"
82134,82135,Richard III,99.0,1.3.326,CATESBY,"And for your grace, and you, my noble lords."
82135,82136,Richard III,100.0,1.3.327,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?"
82136,82137,Richard III,101.0,1.3.328,RIVERS,"Madam, we will attend your grace."
82137,82138,Richard III,101.0,,RIVERS,Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
82138,82139,Richard III,102.0,1.3.329,GLOUCESTER,"I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl."
82139,82140,Richard III,102.0,1.3.330,GLOUCESTER,The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
82140,82141,Richard III,102.0,1.3.331,GLOUCESTER,I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
82141,82142,Richard III,102.0,1.3.332,GLOUCESTER,"Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,"
82142,82143,Richard III,102.0,1.3.333,GLOUCESTER,I do beweep to many simple gulls
82143,82144,Richard III,102.0,1.3.334,GLOUCESTER,"Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham,"
82144,82145,Richard III,102.0,1.3.335,GLOUCESTER,And say it is the queen and her allies
82145,82146,Richard III,102.0,1.3.336,GLOUCESTER,That stir the king against the duke my brother.
82146,82147,Richard III,102.0,1.3.337,GLOUCESTER,"Now, they believe it, and withal whet me"
82147,82148,Richard III,102.0,1.3.338,GLOUCESTER,"To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:"
82148,82149,Richard III,102.0,1.3.339,GLOUCESTER,"But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture,"
82149,82150,Richard III,102.0,1.3.340,GLOUCESTER,Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
82150,82151,Richard III,102.0,1.3.341,GLOUCESTER,And thus I clothe my naked villany
82151,82152,Richard III,102.0,1.3.342,GLOUCESTER,"With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ,"
82152,82153,Richard III,102.0,1.3.343,GLOUCESTER,"And seem a saint, when most I play the devil."
82153,82154,Richard III,102.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter two Murderers
82154,82155,Richard III,102.0,1.3.344,GLOUCESTER,"But, soft! here come my executioners."
82155,82156,Richard III,102.0,1.3.345,GLOUCESTER,"How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!"
82156,82157,Richard III,102.0,1.3.346,GLOUCESTER,Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
82157,82158,Richard III,103.0,1.3.347,First Murderer,"We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant"
82158,82159,Richard III,103.0,1.3.348,First Murderer,That we may be admitted where he is.
82159,82160,Richard III,104.0,1.3.349,GLOUCESTER,"Well thought upon, I have it here about me."
82160,82161,Richard III,104.0,,GLOUCESTER,Gives the warrant
82161,82162,Richard III,104.0,1.3.350,GLOUCESTER,"When you have done, repair to Crosby Place."
82162,82163,Richard III,104.0,1.3.351,GLOUCESTER,"But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,"
82163,82164,Richard III,104.0,1.3.352,GLOUCESTER,"Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead,"
82164,82165,Richard III,104.0,1.3.353,GLOUCESTER,"For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps"
82165,82166,Richard III,104.0,1.3.354,GLOUCESTER,May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
82166,82167,Richard III,105.0,1.3.355,First Murderer,Tush!
82167,82168,Richard III,105.0,1.3.356,First Murderer,"Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate,"
82168,82169,Richard III,105.0,1.3.357,First Murderer,Talkers are no good doers: be assured
82169,82170,Richard III,105.0,1.3.358,First Murderer,We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
82170,82171,Richard III,106.0,1.3.359,GLOUCESTER,"Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:"
82171,82172,Richard III,106.0,1.3.360,GLOUCESTER,"I like you, lads, about your business straight,"
82172,82173,Richard III,106.0,1.3.361,GLOUCESTER,"Go, go, dispatch."
82173,82174,Richard III,107.0,1.3.362,First Murderer,"We will, my noble lord."
82174,82175,Richard III,107.0,,First Murderer,Exeunt
82175,82176,Richard III,107.0,,First Murderer,SCENE IV. London. The Tower.
82176,82177,Richard III,107.0,,First Murderer,Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY
82177,82178,Richard III,1.0,1.4.1,BRAKENBURY,Why looks your grace so heavily today?
82178,82179,Richard III,2.0,1.4.2,CLARENCE,"O, I have pass'd a miserable night,"
82179,82180,Richard III,2.0,1.4.3,CLARENCE,"So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,"
82180,82181,Richard III,2.0,1.4.4,CLARENCE,"That, as I am a Christian faithful man,"
82181,82182,Richard III,2.0,1.4.5,CLARENCE,"I would not spend another such a night,"
82182,82183,Richard III,2.0,1.4.6,CLARENCE,"Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,"
82183,82184,Richard III,2.0,1.4.7,CLARENCE,So full of dismal terror was the time!
82184,82185,Richard III,3.0,1.4.8,BRAKENBURY,What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
82185,82186,Richard III,4.0,1.4.9,CLARENCE,"Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,"
82186,82187,Richard III,4.0,1.4.10,CLARENCE,"And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy,"
82187,82188,Richard III,4.0,1.4.11,CLARENCE,"And, in my company, my brother Gloucester,"
82188,82189,Richard III,4.0,1.4.12,CLARENCE,Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
82189,82190,Richard III,4.0,1.4.13,CLARENCE,"Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,"
82190,82191,Richard III,4.0,1.4.14,CLARENCE,"And cited up a thousand fearful times,"
82191,82192,Richard III,4.0,1.4.15,CLARENCE,During the wars of York and Lancaster
82192,82193,Richard III,4.0,1.4.16,CLARENCE,That had befall'n us. As we paced along
82193,82194,Richard III,4.0,1.4.17,CLARENCE,"Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,"
82194,82195,Richard III,4.0,1.4.18,CLARENCE,"Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and, in falling,"
82195,82196,Richard III,4.0,1.4.19,CLARENCE,"Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,"
82196,82197,Richard III,4.0,1.4.20,CLARENCE,Into the tumbling billows of the main.
82197,82198,Richard III,4.0,1.4.21,CLARENCE,"Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!"
82198,82199,Richard III,4.0,1.4.22,CLARENCE,What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
82199,82200,Richard III,4.0,1.4.23,CLARENCE,What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
82200,82201,Richard III,4.0,1.4.24,CLARENCE,"Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,"
82201,82202,Richard III,4.0,1.4.25,CLARENCE,"Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,"
82202,82203,Richard III,4.0,1.4.26,CLARENCE,"Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,"
82203,82204,Richard III,4.0,1.4.27,CLARENCE,"Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,"
82204,82205,Richard III,4.0,1.4.28,CLARENCE,All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
82205,82206,Richard III,4.0,1.4.29,CLARENCE,"Some lay in dead men's skulls, and, in those holes"
82206,82207,Richard III,4.0,1.4.30,CLARENCE,"Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,"
82207,82208,Richard III,4.0,1.4.31,CLARENCE,"As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,"
82208,82209,Richard III,4.0,1.4.32,CLARENCE,"Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,"
82209,82210,Richard III,4.0,1.4.33,CLARENCE,And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
82210,82211,Richard III,5.0,1.4.34,BRAKENBURY,Had you such leisure in the time of death
82211,82212,Richard III,5.0,1.4.35,BRAKENBURY,To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
82212,82213,Richard III,6.0,1.4.36,CLARENCE,"Methought I had, and often did I strive"
82213,82214,Richard III,6.0,1.4.37,CLARENCE,To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
82214,82215,Richard III,6.0,1.4.38,CLARENCE,"Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth"
82215,82216,Richard III,6.0,1.4.39,CLARENCE,"To seek the empty, vast and wandering air,"
82216,82217,Richard III,6.0,1.4.40,CLARENCE,"But smother'd it within my panting bulk,"
82217,82218,Richard III,6.0,1.4.41,CLARENCE,Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
82218,82219,Richard III,7.0,1.4.42,BRAKENBURY,Awaked you not with this sore agony?
82219,82220,Richard III,8.0,1.4.43,CLARENCE,"O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life,"
82220,82221,Richard III,8.0,1.4.44,CLARENCE,"O, then began the tempest to my soul,"
82221,82222,Richard III,8.0,1.4.45,CLARENCE,"Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,"
82222,82223,Richard III,8.0,1.4.46,CLARENCE,"With that grim ferryman which poets write of,"
82223,82224,Richard III,8.0,1.4.47,CLARENCE,Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
82224,82225,Richard III,8.0,1.4.48,CLARENCE,"The first that there did greet my stranger soul,"
82225,82226,Richard III,8.0,1.4.49,CLARENCE,"Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,"
82226,82227,Richard III,8.0,1.4.50,CLARENCE,"Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury"
82227,82228,Richard III,8.0,1.4.51,CLARENCE,Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
82228,82229,Richard III,8.0,1.4.52,CLARENCE,And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
82229,82230,Richard III,8.0,1.4.53,CLARENCE,"A shadow like an angel, with bright hair"
82230,82231,Richard III,8.0,1.4.54,CLARENCE,"Dabbled in blood, and he squeak'd out aloud,"
82231,82232,Richard III,8.0,1.4.55,CLARENCE,"'Clarence is come, false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,"
82232,82233,Richard III,8.0,1.4.56,CLARENCE,"That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury,"
82233,82234,Richard III,8.0,1.4.57,CLARENCE,"Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'"
82234,82235,Richard III,8.0,1.4.58,CLARENCE,"With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends"
82235,82236,Richard III,8.0,1.4.59,CLARENCE,"Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears"
82236,82237,Richard III,8.0,1.4.60,CLARENCE,"Such hideous cries, that with the very noise"
82237,82238,Richard III,8.0,1.4.61,CLARENCE,"I trembling waked, and for a season after"
82238,82239,Richard III,8.0,1.4.62,CLARENCE,"Could not believe but that I was in hell,"
82239,82240,Richard III,8.0,1.4.63,CLARENCE,Such terrible impression made the dream.
82240,82241,Richard III,9.0,1.4.64,BRAKENBURY,"No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you,"
82241,82242,Richard III,9.0,1.4.65,BRAKENBURY,"I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it."
82242,82243,Richard III,10.0,1.4.66,CLARENCE,"O Brakenbury, I have done those things,"
82243,82244,Richard III,10.0,1.4.67,CLARENCE,"Which now bear evidence against my soul,"
82244,82245,Richard III,10.0,1.4.68,CLARENCE,"For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!"
82245,82246,Richard III,10.0,1.4.69,CLARENCE,"O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,"
82246,82247,Richard III,10.0,1.4.70,CLARENCE,"But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,"
82247,82248,Richard III,10.0,1.4.71,CLARENCE,"Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,"
82248,82249,Richard III,10.0,1.4.72,CLARENCE,"O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!"
82249,82250,Richard III,10.0,1.4.73,CLARENCE,"I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me,"
82250,82251,Richard III,10.0,1.4.74,CLARENCE,"My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep."
82251,82252,Richard III,11.0,1.4.75,BRAKENBURY,"I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!"
82252,82253,Richard III,11.0,,BRAKENBURY,CLARENCE sleeps
82253,82254,Richard III,11.0,1.4.76,BRAKENBURY,"Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,"
82254,82255,Richard III,11.0,1.4.77,BRAKENBURY,"Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night."
82255,82256,Richard III,11.0,1.4.78,BRAKENBURY,"Princes have but their tides for their glories,"
82256,82257,Richard III,11.0,1.4.79,BRAKENBURY,"An outward honour for an inward toil,"
82257,82258,Richard III,11.0,1.4.80,BRAKENBURY,"And, for unfelt imagination,"
82258,82259,Richard III,11.0,1.4.81,BRAKENBURY,They often feel a world of restless cares:
82259,82260,Richard III,11.0,1.4.82,BRAKENBURY,"So that, betwixt their tides and low names,"
82260,82261,Richard III,11.0,1.4.83,BRAKENBURY,There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
82261,82262,Richard III,11.0,,BRAKENBURY,Enter the two Murderers
82262,82263,Richard III,12.0,1.4.84,First Murderer,Ho! who's here?
82263,82264,Richard III,13.0,1.4.85,BRAKENBURY,"In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?"
82264,82265,Richard III,14.0,1.4.86,First Murderer,"I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs."
82265,82266,Richard III,15.0,1.4.87,BRAKENBURY,"Yea, are you so brief?"
82266,82267,Richard III,16.0,1.4.88,Second Murderer,"O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show"
82267,82268,Richard III,16.0,1.4.89,Second Murderer,"him our commission, talk no more."
82268,82269,Richard III,16.0,,Second Murderer,BRAKENBURY reads it
82269,82270,Richard III,17.0,1.4.90,BRAKENBURY,"I am, in this, commanded to deliver"
82270,82271,Richard III,17.0,1.4.91,BRAKENBURY,The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
82271,82272,Richard III,17.0,1.4.92,BRAKENBURY,"I will not reason what is meant hereby,"
82272,82273,Richard III,17.0,1.4.93,BRAKENBURY,Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
82273,82274,Richard III,17.0,1.4.94,BRAKENBURY,"Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:"
82274,82275,Richard III,17.0,1.4.95,BRAKENBURY,"I'll to the king, and signify to him"
82275,82276,Richard III,17.0,1.4.96,BRAKENBURY,That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
82276,82277,Richard III,18.0,1.4.97,First Murderer,"Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well."
82277,82278,Richard III,18.0,,First Murderer,Exit BRAKENBURY
82278,82279,Richard III,19.0,1.4.98,Second Murderer,"What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?"
82279,82280,Richard III,20.0,1.4.99,First Murderer,"No, then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes."
82280,82281,Richard III,21.0,1.4.100,Second Murderer,"When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till"
82281,82282,Richard III,21.0,1.4.101,Second Murderer,the judgment-day.
82282,82283,Richard III,22.0,1.4.102,First Murderer,"Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping."
82283,82284,Richard III,23.0,1.4.103,Second Murderer,The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
82284,82285,Richard III,23.0,1.4.104,Second Murderer,of remorse in me.
82285,82286,Richard III,24.0,1.4.105,First Murderer,"What, art thou afraid?"
82286,82287,Richard III,25.0,1.4.106,Second Murderer,"Not to kill him, having a warrant for it, but to be"
82287,82288,Richard III,25.0,1.4.107,Second Murderer,"damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us."
82288,82289,Richard III,26.0,1.4.108,First Murderer,I thought thou hadst been resolute.
82289,82290,Richard III,27.0,1.4.109,Second Murderer,"So I am, to let him live."
82290,82291,Richard III,28.0,1.4.110,First Murderer,"Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so."
82291,82292,Richard III,29.0,1.4.111,Second Murderer,"I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour"
82292,82293,Richard III,29.0,1.4.112,Second Murderer,"will change, 'twas wont to hold me but while one"
82293,82294,Richard III,29.0,1.4.113,Second Murderer,would tell twenty.
82294,82295,Richard III,30.0,1.4.114,First Murderer,How dost thou feel thyself now?
82295,82296,Richard III,31.0,1.4.115,Second Murderer,"'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet"
82296,82297,Richard III,31.0,1.4.116,Second Murderer,within me.
82297,82298,Richard III,32.0,1.4.117,First Murderer,"Remember our reward, when the deed is done."
82298,82299,Richard III,33.0,1.4.118,Second Murderer,"'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward."
82299,82300,Richard III,34.0,1.4.119,First Murderer,Where is thy conscience now?
82300,82301,Richard III,35.0,1.4.120,Second Murderer,In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
82301,82302,Richard III,36.0,1.4.121,First Murderer,"So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,"
82302,82303,Richard III,36.0,1.4.122,First Murderer,thy conscience flies out.
82303,82304,Richard III,37.0,1.4.123,Second Murderer,"Let it go, there's few or none will entertain it."
82304,82305,Richard III,38.0,1.4.124,First Murderer,How if it come to thee again?
82305,82306,Richard III,39.0,1.4.125,Second Murderer,I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
82306,82307,Richard III,39.0,1.4.126,Second Murderer,"makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it"
82307,82308,Richard III,39.0,1.4.127,Second Murderer,"accuseth him, he cannot swear, but it cheques him,"
82308,82309,Richard III,39.0,1.4.128,Second Murderer,"he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it"
82309,82310,Richard III,39.0,1.4.129,Second Murderer,detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
82310,82311,Richard III,39.0,1.4.130,Second Murderer,"mutinies in a man's bosom, it fills one full of"
82311,82312,Richard III,39.0,1.4.131,Second Murderer,obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
82312,82313,Richard III,39.0,1.4.132,Second Murderer,"that I found, it beggars any man that keeps it: it"
82313,82314,Richard III,39.0,1.4.133,Second Murderer,is turned out of all towns and cities for a
82314,82315,Richard III,39.0,1.4.134,Second Murderer,"dangerous thing, and every man that means to live"
82315,82316,Richard III,39.0,1.4.135,Second Murderer,well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
82316,82317,Richard III,39.0,1.4.136,Second Murderer,without it.
82317,82318,Richard III,40.0,1.4.137,First Murderer,"'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me"
82318,82319,Richard III,40.0,1.4.138,First Murderer,not to kill the duke.
82319,82320,Richard III,41.0,1.4.139,Second Murderer,"Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he"
82320,82321,Richard III,41.0,1.4.140,Second Murderer,would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
82321,82322,Richard III,42.0,1.4.141,First Murderer,"Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,"
82322,82323,Richard III,42.0,1.4.142,First Murderer,I warrant thee.
82323,82324,Richard III,43.0,1.4.143,Second Murderer,Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
82324,82325,Richard III,43.0,1.4.144,Second Murderer,"reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?"
82325,82326,Richard III,44.0,1.4.145,First Murderer,Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
82326,82327,Richard III,44.0,1.4.146,First Murderer,"sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt"
82327,82328,Richard III,44.0,1.4.147,First Murderer,in the next room.
82328,82329,Richard III,45.0,1.4.148,Second Murderer,O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
82329,82330,Richard III,46.0,1.4.149,First Murderer,Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
82330,82331,Richard III,47.0,1.4.150,Second Murderer,"No, first let's reason with him."
82331,82332,Richard III,48.0,1.4.151,CLARENCE,"Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine."
82332,82333,Richard III,49.0,1.4.152,Second murderer,"You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon."
82333,82334,Richard III,50.0,1.4.153,CLARENCE,"In God's name, what art thou?"
82334,82335,Richard III,51.0,1.4.154,Second Murderer,"A man, as you are."
82335,82336,Richard III,52.0,1.4.155,CLARENCE,"But not, as I am, royal."
82336,82337,Richard III,53.0,1.4.156,Second Murderer,"Nor you, as we are, loyal."
82337,82338,Richard III,54.0,1.4.157,CLARENCE,"Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble."
82338,82339,Richard III,55.0,1.4.158,Second Murderer,"My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own."
82339,82340,Richard III,56.0,1.4.159,CLARENCE,How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
82340,82341,Richard III,56.0,1.4.160,CLARENCE,Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
82341,82342,Richard III,56.0,1.4.161,CLARENCE,Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
82342,82343,Richard III,57.0,1.4.162,Both,"To, to, to--"
82343,82344,Richard III,58.0,1.4.163,CLARENCE,To murder me?
82344,82345,Richard III,59.0,1.4.164,Both,"Ay, ay."
82345,82346,Richard III,60.0,1.4.165,CLARENCE,"You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,"
82346,82347,Richard III,60.0,1.4.166,CLARENCE,And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
82347,82348,Richard III,60.0,1.4.167,CLARENCE,"Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?"
82348,82349,Richard III,61.0,1.4.168,First Murderer,"Offended us you have not, but the king."
82349,82350,Richard III,62.0,1.4.169,CLARENCE,I shall be reconciled to him again.
82350,82351,Richard III,63.0,1.4.170,Second Murderer,"Never, my lord, therefore prepare to die."
82351,82352,Richard III,64.0,1.4.171,CLARENCE,Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
82352,82353,Richard III,64.0,1.4.172,CLARENCE,To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
82353,82354,Richard III,64.0,1.4.173,CLARENCE,Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
82354,82355,Richard III,64.0,1.4.174,CLARENCE,What lawful quest have given their verdict up
82355,82356,Richard III,64.0,1.4.175,CLARENCE,Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
82356,82357,Richard III,64.0,1.4.176,CLARENCE,The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
82357,82358,Richard III,64.0,1.4.177,CLARENCE,"Before I be convict by course of law,"
82358,82359,Richard III,64.0,1.4.178,CLARENCE,To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
82359,82360,Richard III,64.0,1.4.179,CLARENCE,"I charge you, as you hope to have redemption"
82360,82361,Richard III,64.0,1.4.180,CLARENCE,"By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,"
82361,82362,Richard III,64.0,1.4.181,CLARENCE,That you depart and lay no hands on me
82362,82363,Richard III,64.0,1.4.182,CLARENCE,The deed you undertake is damnable.
82363,82364,Richard III,65.0,1.4.183,First Murderer,"What we will do, we do upon command."
82364,82365,Richard III,66.0,1.4.184,Second Murderer,And he that hath commanded is the king.
82365,82366,Richard III,67.0,1.4.185,CLARENCE,Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
82366,82367,Richard III,67.0,1.4.186,CLARENCE,Hath in the tables of his law commanded
82367,82368,Richard III,67.0,1.4.187,CLARENCE,"That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,"
82368,82369,Richard III,67.0,1.4.188,CLARENCE,Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
82369,82370,Richard III,67.0,1.4.189,CLARENCE,"Take heed, for he holds vengeance in his hands,"
82370,82371,Richard III,67.0,1.4.190,CLARENCE,To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
82371,82372,Richard III,68.0,1.4.191,Second Murderer,"And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,"
82372,82373,Richard III,68.0,1.4.192,Second Murderer,For false forswearing and for murder too:
82373,82374,Richard III,68.0,1.4.193,Second Murderer,"Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,"
82374,82375,Richard III,68.0,1.4.194,Second Murderer,To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
82375,82376,Richard III,69.0,1.4.195,First Murderer,"And, like a traitor to the name of God,"
82376,82377,Richard III,69.0,1.4.196,First Murderer,"Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade"
82377,82378,Richard III,69.0,1.4.197,First Murderer,Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
82378,82379,Richard III,70.0,1.4.198,Second Murderer,Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
82379,82380,Richard III,71.0,1.4.199,First Murderer,"How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,"
82380,82381,Richard III,71.0,1.4.200,First Murderer,When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
82381,82382,Richard III,72.0,1.4.201,CLARENCE,Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
82382,82383,Richard III,72.0,1.4.202,CLARENCE,"For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,"
82383,82384,Richard III,72.0,1.4.203,CLARENCE,He sends ye not to murder me for this
82384,82385,Richard III,72.0,1.4.204,CLARENCE,For in this sin he is as deep as I.
82385,82386,Richard III,72.0,1.4.205,CLARENCE,If God will be revenged for this deed.
82386,82387,Richard III,72.0,1.4.206,CLARENCE,"O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,"
82387,82388,Richard III,72.0,1.4.207,CLARENCE,"Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm,"
82388,82389,Richard III,72.0,1.4.208,CLARENCE,He needs no indirect nor lawless course
82389,82390,Richard III,72.0,1.4.209,CLARENCE,To cut off those that have offended him.
82390,82391,Richard III,73.0,1.4.210,First Murderer,"Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,"
82391,82392,Richard III,73.0,1.4.211,First Murderer,"When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,"
82392,82393,Richard III,73.0,1.4.212,First Murderer,"That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?"
82393,82394,Richard III,74.0,1.4.213,CLARENCE,"My brother's love, the devil, and my rage."
82394,82395,Richard III,75.0,1.4.214,First Murderer,"Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,"
82395,82396,Richard III,75.0,1.4.215,First Murderer,Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
82396,82397,Richard III,76.0,1.4.216,CLARENCE,"Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me,"
82397,82398,Richard III,76.0,1.4.217,CLARENCE,"I am his brother, and I love him well."
82398,82399,Richard III,76.0,1.4.218,CLARENCE,"If you be hired for meed, go back again,"
82399,82400,Richard III,76.0,1.4.219,CLARENCE,"And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,"
82400,82401,Richard III,76.0,1.4.220,CLARENCE,Who shall reward you better for my life
82401,82402,Richard III,76.0,1.4.221,CLARENCE,Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
82402,82403,Richard III,77.0,1.4.222,Second Murderer,"You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you."
82403,82404,Richard III,78.0,1.4.223,CLARENCE,"O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:"
82404,82405,Richard III,78.0,1.4.224,CLARENCE,Go you to him from me.
82405,82406,Richard III,79.0,1.4.225,Both,"Ay, so we will."
82406,82407,Richard III,80.0,1.4.226,CLARENCE,"Tell him, when that our princely father York"
82407,82408,Richard III,80.0,1.4.227,CLARENCE,"Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,"
82408,82409,Richard III,80.0,1.4.228,CLARENCE,"And charged us from his soul to love each other,"
82409,82410,Richard III,80.0,1.4.229,CLARENCE,He little thought of this divided friendship:
82410,82411,Richard III,80.0,1.4.230,CLARENCE,"Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep."
82411,82412,Richard III,81.0,1.4.231,First Murderer,"Ay, millstones, as be lesson'd us to weep."
82412,82413,Richard III,82.0,1.4.232,CLARENCE,"O, do not slander him, for he is kind."
82413,82414,Richard III,83.0,1.4.233,First Murderer,"Right,"
82414,82415,Richard III,83.0,1.4.234,First Murderer,As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
82415,82416,Richard III,83.0,1.4.235,First Murderer,'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
82416,82417,Richard III,84.0,1.4.236,CLARENCE,"It cannot be, for when I parted with him,"
82417,82418,Richard III,84.0,1.4.237,CLARENCE,"He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,"
82418,82419,Richard III,84.0,1.4.238,CLARENCE,That he would labour my delivery.
82419,82420,Richard III,85.0,1.4.239,Second Murderer,"Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee"
82420,82421,Richard III,85.0,1.4.240,Second Murderer,From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
82421,82422,Richard III,86.0,1.4.241,First Murderer,"Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord."
82422,82423,Richard III,87.0,1.4.242,CLARENCE,"Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,"
82423,82424,Richard III,87.0,1.4.243,CLARENCE,"To counsel me to make my peace with God,"
82424,82425,Richard III,87.0,1.4.244,CLARENCE,"And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,"
82425,82426,Richard III,87.0,1.4.245,CLARENCE,That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
82426,82427,Richard III,87.0,1.4.246,CLARENCE,"Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on"
82427,82428,Richard III,87.0,1.4.247,CLARENCE,To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
82428,82429,Richard III,88.0,1.4.248,Second Murderer,What shall we do?
82429,82430,Richard III,89.0,1.4.249,CLARENCE,"Relent, and save your souls."
82430,82431,Richard III,90.0,1.4.250,First Murderer,Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
82431,82432,Richard III,91.0,1.4.251,CLARENCE,"Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish."

82579,82580,Richard III,32.0,2.1.111,KING EDWARD IV,"The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?"
82580,82581,Richard III,32.0,2.1.112,KING EDWARD IV,"Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury"

82618,82619,Richard III,3.0,2.2.4,Boy,"And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'"
82619,82620,Richard III,4.0,2.2.5,Girl,"Why do you look on us, and shake your head,"
82620,82621,Richard III,4.0,2.2.6,Girl,"And call us wretches, orphans, castaways"
82621,82622,Richard III,4.0,2.2.7,Girl,If that our noble father be alive?
82622,82623,Richard III,5.0,2.2.8,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My pretty cousins, you mistake me much,"
82623,82624,Richard III,5.0,2.2.9,DUCHESS OF YORK,I do lament the sickness of the king.
82624,82625,Richard III,5.0,2.2.10,DUCHESS OF YORK,"As loath to lose him, not your father's death,"
82625,82626,Richard III,5.0,2.2.11,DUCHESS OF YORK,It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
82626,82627,Richard III,6.0,2.2.12,Boy,"Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead."
82627,82628,Richard III,6.0,2.2.13,Boy,The king my uncle is to blame for this:
82628,82629,Richard III,6.0,2.2.14,Boy,"God will revenge it, whom I will importune"
82629,82630,Richard III,6.0,2.2.15,Boy,With daily prayers all to that effect.
82630,82631,Richard III,7.0,2.2.16,Girl,And so will I.
82631,82632,Richard III,8.0,2.2.17,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:"
82632,82633,Richard III,8.0,2.2.18,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Incapable and shallow innocents,"
82633,82634,Richard III,8.0,2.2.19,DUCHESS OF YORK,You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
82634,82635,Richard III,9.0,2.2.20,Boy,"Grandam, we can, for my good uncle Gloucester"
82635,82636,Richard III,9.0,2.2.21,Boy,"Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,"
82636,82637,Richard III,9.0,2.2.22,Boy,Devised impeachments to imprison him :
82637,82638,Richard III,9.0,2.2.23,Boy,"And when my uncle told me so, he wept,"
82638,82639,Richard III,9.0,2.2.24,Boy,"And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek,"
82639,82640,Richard III,9.0,2.2.25,Boy,"Bade me rely on him as on my father,"
82640,82641,Richard III,9.0,2.2.26,Boy,And he would love me dearly as his child.
82641,82642,Richard III,10.0,2.2.27,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,"
82642,82643,Richard III,10.0,2.2.28,DUCHESS OF YORK,And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
82643,82644,Richard III,10.0,2.2.29,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He is my son, yea, and therein my shame,"
82644,82645,Richard III,10.0,2.2.30,DUCHESS OF YORK,Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
82645,82646,Richard III,11.0,2.2.31,Boy,"Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?"
82646,82647,Richard III,12.0,2.2.32,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ay, boy."
82647,82648,Richard III,13.0,2.2.33,Boy,I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
82648,82649,Richard III,13.0,2.2.33,Boy,"Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her ears, RIVERS, and DORSET after her"
82649,82650,Richard III,14.0,2.2.34,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,"
82650,82651,Richard III,14.0,2.2.35,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To chide my fortune, and torment myself?"
82651,82652,Richard III,14.0,2.2.36,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"I'll join with black despair against my soul,"
82652,82653,Richard III,14.0,2.2.37,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And to myself become an enemy.
82653,82654,Richard III,15.0,2.2.38,DUCHESS OF YORK,What means this scene of rude impatience?
82654,82655,Richard III,16.0,2.2.39,QUEEN ELIZABETH,To make an act of tragic violence:
82655,82656,Richard III,16.0,2.2.40,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead."
82656,82657,Richard III,16.0,2.2.41,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
82657,82658,Richard III,16.0,2.2.42,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
82658,82659,Richard III,16.0,2.2.43,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If you will live, lament, if die, be brief,"
82659,82660,Richard III,16.0,2.2.44,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's,"
82660,82661,Richard III,16.0,2.2.45,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Or, like obedient subjects, follow him"
82661,82662,Richard III,16.0,2.2.46,QUEEN ELIZABETH,To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
82662,82663,Richard III,17.0,2.2.47,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow"
82663,82664,Richard III,17.0,2.2.48,DUCHESS OF YORK,As I had title in thy noble husband!
82664,82665,Richard III,17.0,2.2.49,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I have bewept a worthy husband's death,"
82665,82666,Richard III,17.0,2.2.50,DUCHESS OF YORK,And lived by looking on his images:
82666,82667,Richard III,17.0,2.2.51,DUCHESS OF YORK,But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
82667,82668,Richard III,17.0,2.2.52,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,"
82668,82669,Richard III,17.0,2.2.53,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And I for comfort have but one false glass,"
82669,82670,Richard III,17.0,2.2.54,DUCHESS OF YORK,Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
82670,82671,Richard III,17.0,2.2.55,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,"
82671,82672,Richard III,17.0,2.2.56,DUCHESS OF YORK,And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
82672,82673,Richard III,17.0,2.2.57,DUCHESS OF YORK,"But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,"
82673,82674,Richard III,17.0,2.2.58,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,"
82674,82675,Richard III,17.0,2.2.59,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,"
82675,82676,Richard III,17.0,2.2.60,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thine being but a moiety of my grief,"
82676,82677,Richard III,17.0,2.2.61,DUCHESS OF YORK,To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
82677,82678,Richard III,18.0,2.2.62,Boy,"Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death,"
82678,82679,Richard III,18.0,2.2.63,Boy,How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
82679,82680,Richard III,19.0,2.2.64,Girl,"Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd,"
82680,82681,Richard III,19.0,2.2.65,Girl,Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
82681,82682,Richard III,20.0,2.2.66,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Give me no help in lamentation,"
82682,82683,Richard III,20.0,2.2.67,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I am not barren to bring forth complaints
82683,82684,Richard III,20.0,2.2.68,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,"
82684,82685,Richard III,20.0,2.2.69,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,"
82685,82686,Richard III,20.0,2.2.70,QUEEN ELIZABETH,May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
82686,82687,Richard III,20.0,2.2.71,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!"
82687,82688,Richard III,21.0,2.2.72,Children,"Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!"
82688,82689,Richard III,22.0,2.2.73,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!"
82689,82690,Richard III,23.0,2.2.74,QUEEN ELIZABETH,What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
82690,82691,Richard III,24.0,2.2.75,Children,What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
82691,82692,Richard III,25.0,2.2.76,DUCHESS OF YORK,What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
82692,82693,Richard III,26.0,2.2.77,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Was never widow had so dear a loss!
82693,82694,Richard III,27.0,2.2.78,Children,Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
82694,82695,Richard III,28.0,2.2.79,DUCHESS OF YORK,Was never mother had so dear a loss!
82695,82696,Richard III,28.0,2.2.80,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alas, I am the mother of these moans!"
82696,82697,Richard III,28.0,2.2.81,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general."
82697,82698,Richard III,28.0,2.2.82,DUCHESS OF YORK,"She for an Edward weeps, and so do I,"
82698,82699,Richard III,28.0,2.2.83,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:"
82699,82700,Richard III,28.0,2.2.84,DUCHESS OF YORK,"These babes for Clarence weep and so do I,"
82700,82701,Richard III,28.0,2.2.85,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I for an Edward weep, so do not they:"
82701,82702,Richard III,28.0,2.2.86,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,"
82702,82703,Richard III,28.0,2.2.87,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,"
82703,82704,Richard III,28.0,2.2.88,DUCHESS OF YORK,And I will pamper it with lamentations.
82704,82705,Richard III,29.0,2.2.89,DORSET,"Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased"
82705,82706,Richard III,29.0,2.2.90,DORSET,"That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:"
82706,82707,Richard III,29.0,2.2.91,DORSET,"In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,"
82707,82708,Richard III,29.0,2.2.92,DORSET,With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
82708,82709,Richard III,29.0,2.2.93,DORSET,"Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent,"
82709,82710,Richard III,29.0,2.2.94,DORSET,"Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,"
82710,82711,Richard III,29.0,2.2.95,DORSET,For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
82711,82712,Richard III,30.0,2.2.96,RIVERS,"Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,"
82712,82713,Richard III,30.0,2.2.97,RIVERS,Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
82713,82714,Richard III,30.0,2.2.98,RIVERS,"Let him be crown'd, in him your comfort lives:"
82714,82715,Richard III,30.0,2.2.99,RIVERS,"Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,"
82715,82716,Richard III,30.0,2.2.100,RIVERS,And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
82716,82717,Richard III,30.0,,RIVERS,"Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF"
82717,82718,Richard III,31.0,2.2.101,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause"
82718,82719,Richard III,31.0,2.2.102,GLOUCESTER,"To wail the dimming of our shining star,"
82719,82720,Richard III,31.0,2.2.103,GLOUCESTER,But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
82720,82721,Richard III,31.0,2.2.104,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy,"
82721,82722,Richard III,31.0,2.2.105,GLOUCESTER,I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
82722,82723,Richard III,31.0,2.2.106,GLOUCESTER,I crave your blessing.
82723,82724,Richard III,32.0,2.2.107,DUCHESS OF YORK,"God bless thee, and put meekness in thy mind,"
82724,82725,Richard III,32.0,2.2.108,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!"
82725,82726,Richard III,33.0,2.2.109,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  Amen, and make me die a good old man!"
82726,82727,Richard III,33.0,2.2.110,GLOUCESTER,That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
82727,82728,Richard III,33.0,2.2.111,GLOUCESTER,I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
82728,82729,Richard III,34.0,2.2.112,BUCKINGHAM,"You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,"
82729,82730,Richard III,34.0,2.2.113,BUCKINGHAM,"That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,"
82730,82731,Richard III,34.0,2.2.114,BUCKINGHAM,Now cheer each other in each other's love
82731,82732,Richard III,34.0,2.2.115,BUCKINGHAM,"Though we have spent our harvest of this king,"
82732,82733,Richard III,34.0,2.2.116,BUCKINGHAM,We are to reap the harvest of his son.
82733,82734,Richard III,34.0,2.2.117,BUCKINGHAM,"The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,"
82734,82735,Richard III,34.0,2.2.118,BUCKINGHAM,"But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,"
82735,82736,Richard III,34.0,2.2.119,BUCKINGHAM,"Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:"
82736,82737,Richard III,34.0,2.2.120,BUCKINGHAM,"Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,"
82737,82738,Richard III,34.0,2.2.121,BUCKINGHAM,Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
82738,82739,Richard III,34.0,2.2.122,BUCKINGHAM,"Hither to London, to be crown'd our king."
82739,82740,Richard III,35.0,2.2.123,RIVERS,"Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?"
82740,82741,Richard III,36.0,2.2.124,BUCKINGHAM,"Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,"
82741,82742,Richard III,36.0,2.2.125,BUCKINGHAM,"The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,"
82742,82743,Richard III,36.0,2.2.126,BUCKINGHAM,Which would be so much the more dangerous
82743,82744,Richard III,36.0,2.2.127,BUCKINGHAM,By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
82744,82745,Richard III,36.0,2.2.128,BUCKINGHAM,"Where every horse bears his commanding rein,"
82745,82746,Richard III,36.0,2.2.129,BUCKINGHAM,"And may direct his course as please himself,"
82746,82747,Richard III,36.0,2.2.130,BUCKINGHAM,"As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,"
82747,82748,Richard III,36.0,2.2.131,BUCKINGHAM,"In my opinion, ought to be prevented."
82748,82749,Richard III,37.0,2.2.132,GLOUCESTER,I hope the king made peace with all of us
82749,82750,Richard III,37.0,2.2.133,GLOUCESTER,And the compact is firm and true in me.
82750,82751,Richard III,38.0,2.2.134,RIVERS,"And so in me, and so, I think, in all:"
82751,82752,Richard III,38.0,2.2.135,RIVERS,"Yet, since it is but green, it should be put"
82752,82753,Richard III,38.0,2.2.136,RIVERS,"To no apparent likelihood of breach,"
82753,82754,Richard III,38.0,2.2.137,RIVERS,Which haply by much company might be urged:
82754,82755,Richard III,38.0,2.2.138,RIVERS,"Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,"
82755,82756,Richard III,38.0,2.2.139,RIVERS,That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
82756,82757,Richard III,39.0,2.2.140,HASTINGS,And so say I.
82757,82758,Richard III,40.0,2.2.141,GLOUCESTER,"Then be it so, and go we to determine"
82758,82759,Richard III,40.0,2.2.142,GLOUCESTER,Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
82759,82760,Richard III,40.0,2.2.143,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, and you, my mother, will you go"
82760,82761,Richard III,40.0,2.2.144,GLOUCESTER,To give your censures in this weighty business?
82761,82762,Richard III,42.0,2.2.145,DUCHESS OF YORK,With all our harts.
82762,82763,Richard III,42.0,,DUCHESS OF YORK,Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
82763,82764,Richard III,43.0,2.2.146,BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,"
82764,82765,Richard III,43.0,2.2.147,BUCKINGHAM,"For God's sake, let not us two be behind,"
82765,82766,Richard III,43.0,2.2.148,BUCKINGHAM,"For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,"
82766,82767,Richard III,43.0,2.2.149,BUCKINGHAM,"As index to the story we late talk'd of,"
82767,82768,Richard III,43.0,2.2.150,BUCKINGHAM,To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
82768,82769,Richard III,44.0,2.2.151,GLOUCESTER,"My other self, my counsel's consistory,"
82769,82770,Richard III,44.0,2.2.152,GLOUCESTER,"My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,"
82770,82771,Richard III,44.0,2.2.153,GLOUCESTER,"I, like a child, will go by thy direction."
82771,82772,Richard III,44.0,2.2.154,GLOUCESTER,"Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind."
82772,82773,Richard III,44.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exeunt
82773,82774,Richard III,44.0,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE III. London. A street.
82774,82775,Richard III,44.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter two Citizens meeting
82775,82776,Richard III,1.0,2.3.1,First Citizen,"Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?"
82776,82777,Richard III,2.0,2.3.2,Second Citizen,"I promise you, I scarcely know myself:"
82777,82778,Richard III,2.0,2.3.3,Second Citizen,Hear you the news abroad?
82778,82779,Richard III,3.0,2.3.4,First Citizen,"Ay, that the king is dead."
82779,82780,Richard III,4.0,2.3.5,Second Citizen,"Bad news, by'r lady, seldom comes the better:"
82780,82781,Richard III,4.0,2.3.6,Second Citizen,"I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world."
82781,82782,Richard III,4.0,,Second Citizen,Enter another Citizen
82782,82783,Richard III,5.0,2.3.7,Third Citizen,"Neighbours, God speed!"
82783,82784,Richard III,6.0,2.3.8,First Citizen,"Give you good morrow, sir."
82784,82785,Richard III,7.0,2.3.9,Third Citizen,Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
82785,82786,Richard III,8.0,2.3.10,Second Citizen,"Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while!"
82786,82787,Richard III,9.0,2.3.11,Third Citizen,"Then, masters, look to see a troublous world."
82787,82788,Richard III,10.0,2.3.12,First Citizen,"No, no, by God's good grace his son shall reign."
82788,82789,Richard III,11.0,2.3.13,Third Citizen,Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
82789,82790,Richard III,12.0,2.3.14,Second Citizen,"In him there is a hope of government,"
82790,82791,Richard III,12.0,2.3.15,Second Citizen,"That in his nonage council under him,"
82791,82792,Richard III,12.0,2.3.16,Second Citizen,"And in his full and ripen'd years himself,"
82792,82793,Richard III,12.0,2.3.17,Second Citizen,"No doubt, shall then and till then govern well."
82793,82794,Richard III,13.0,2.3.18,First Citizen,So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
82794,82795,Richard III,13.0,2.3.19,First Citizen,Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
82795,82796,Richard III,14.0,2.3.20,Third Citizen,"Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot,"
82796,82797,Richard III,14.0,2.3.21,Third Citizen,For then this land was famously enrich'd

82800,82801,Richard III,16.0,2.3.25,Third Citizen,"Better it were they all came by the father,"
82801,82802,Richard III,16.0,2.3.26,Third Citizen,"Or by the father there were none at all,"
82802,82803,Richard III,16.0,2.3.27,Third Citizen,"For emulation now, who shall be nearest,"

82817,82818,Richard III,19.0,2.3.42,Second Citizen,That looks not heavily and full of fear.

82829,82830,Richard III,1.0,2.4.2,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
82830,82831,Richard III,1.0,2.4.3,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To-morrow, or next day, they will be here."
82831,82832,Richard III,2.0,2.4.4,DUCHESS OF YORK,I long with all my heart to see the prince:
82832,82833,Richard III,2.0,2.4.5,DUCHESS OF YORK,I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
82833,82834,Richard III,3.0,2.4.6,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But I hear, no, they say my son of York"
82834,82835,Richard III,3.0,2.4.7,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
82835,82836,Richard III,4.0,2.4.8,YORK,"Ay, mother, but I would not have it so."
82836,82837,Richard III,5.0,2.4.9,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow."
82837,82838,Richard III,6.0,2.4.10,YORK,"Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,"
82838,82839,Richard III,6.0,2.4.11,YORK,My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
82839,82840,Richard III,6.0,2.4.12,YORK,"More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle"

82843,82844,Richard III,6.0,2.4.16,YORK,Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
82844,82845,Richard III,7.0,2.4.17,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold"
82845,82846,Richard III,7.0,2.4.18,DUCHESS OF YORK,"In him that did object the same to thee,"

82850,82851,Richard III,9.0,2.4.23,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt."
82851,82852,Richard III,10.0,2.4.24,YORK,"Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,"
82852,82853,Richard III,10.0,2.4.25,YORK,"I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,"
82853,82854,Richard III,10.0,2.4.26,YORK,To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
82854,82855,Richard III,11.0,2.4.27,DUCHESS OF YORK,"How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it."
82855,82856,Richard III,12.0,2.4.28,YORK,"Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast"

82890,82891,Richard III,31.0,2.4.62,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And often up and down my sons were toss'd,"

82892,82893,Richard III,31.0,2.4.64,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And being seated, and domestic broils"
82893,82894,Richard III,31.0,2.4.65,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors."

82914,82915,Richard III,2.0,3.1.3,GLOUCESTER,The weary way hath made you melancholy.
82915,82916,Richard III,3.0,3.1.4,PRINCE EDWARD,"No, uncle, but our crosses on the way"
82916,82917,Richard III,3.0,3.1.5,PRINCE EDWARD,"Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy"
82917,82918,Richard III,3.0,3.1.6,PRINCE EDWARD,I want more uncles here to welcome me.

82923,82924,Richard III,4.0,3.1.12,GLOUCESTER,"Those uncles which you want were dangerous,"

82941,82942,Richard III,11.0,3.1.28,HASTINGS,Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince

82943,82944,Richard III,11.0,3.1.30,HASTINGS,But by his mother was perforce withheld.
82944,82945,Richard III,12.0,3.1.31,BUCKINGHAM,"Fie, what an indirect and peevish course"
82945,82946,Richard III,12.0,3.1.32,BUCKINGHAM,"Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace"
82946,82947,Richard III,12.0,3.1.33,BUCKINGHAM,Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
82947,82948,Richard III,12.0,3.1.34,BUCKINGHAM,Unto his princely brother presently?

82949,82950,Richard III,12.0,3.1.36,BUCKINGHAM,And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

82956,82957,Richard III,13.0,3.1.43,CARDINAL,Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
82957,82958,Richard III,14.0,3.1.44,BUCKINGHAM,"You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,"
82958,82959,Richard III,14.0,3.1.45,BUCKINGHAM,Too ceremonious and traditional

82963,82964,Richard III,14.0,3.1.50,BUCKINGHAM,And those who have the wit to claim the place:

82965,82966,Richard III,14.0,3.1.52,BUCKINGHAM,"And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:"
82966,82967,Richard III,14.0,3.1.53,BUCKINGHAM,"Then, taking him from thence that is not there,"
82967,82968,Richard III,14.0,3.1.54,BUCKINGHAM,You break no privilege nor charter there.
82968,82969,Richard III,14.0,3.1.55,BUCKINGHAM,"Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,"
82969,82970,Richard III,14.0,3.1.56,BUCKINGHAM,But sanctuary children ne'er till now.

82972,82973,Richard III,16.0,3.1.59,HASTINGS,"I go, my lord."
82973,82974,Richard III,17.0,3.1.60,PRINCE EDWARD,"Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may."

82978,82979,Richard III,18.0,3.1.64,GLOUCESTER,"If I may counsel you, some day or two"
82979,82980,Richard III,18.0,3.1.65,GLOUCESTER,Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
82980,82981,Richard III,18.0,3.1.66,GLOUCESTER,"Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit"
82981,82982,Richard III,18.0,3.1.67,GLOUCESTER,For your best health and recreation.
82982,82983,Richard III,19.0,3.1.68,PRINCE EDWARD,"I do not like the Tower, of any place."
82983,82984,Richard III,19.0,3.1.69,PRINCE EDWARD,"Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?"
82984,82985,Richard III,20.0,3.1.70,BUCKINGHAM,"He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,"
82985,82986,Richard III,20.0,3.1.71,BUCKINGHAM,"Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified."
82986,82987,Richard III,21.0,3.1.72,PRINCE EDWARD,"Is it upon record, or else reported"
82987,82988,Richard III,21.0,3.1.73,PRINCE EDWARD,"Successively from age to age, he built it?"
82988,82989,Richard III,22.0,3.1.74,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon record, my gracious lord."
82989,82990,Richard III,23.0,3.1.75,PRINCE EDWARD,"But say, my lord, it were not register'd,"
82990,82991,Richard III,23.0,3.1.76,PRINCE EDWARD,"Methinks the truth should live from age to age,"
82991,82992,Richard III,23.0,3.1.77,PRINCE EDWARD,"As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,"
82992,82993,Richard III,23.0,3.1.78,PRINCE EDWARD,Even to the general all-ending day.
82993,82994,Richard III,24.0,3.1.79,GLOUCESTER,"[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never"
82994,82995,Richard III,24.0,3.1.80,GLOUCESTER,live long.
82995,82996,Richard III,25.0,3.1.81,PRINCE EDWARD,"What say you, uncle?"
82996,82997,Richard III,26.0,3.1.82,GLOUCESTER,"I say, without characters, fame lives long."
82997,82998,Richard III,26.0,,GLOUCESTER,Aside
82998,82999,Richard III,26.0,3.1.83,GLOUCESTER,"Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,"
82999,83000,Richard III,26.0,3.1.84,GLOUCESTER,I moralize two meanings in one word.
83000,83001,Richard III,27.0,3.1.85,PRINCE EDWARD,"That Julius Caesar was a famous man,"
83001,83002,Richard III,27.0,3.1.86,PRINCE EDWARD,"With what his valour did enrich his wit,"
83002,83003,Richard III,27.0,3.1.87,PRINCE EDWARD,His wit set down to make his valour live
83003,83004,Richard III,27.0,3.1.88,PRINCE EDWARD,"Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,"
83004,83005,Richard III,27.0,3.1.89,PRINCE EDWARD,"For now he lives in fame, though not in life."
83005,83006,Richard III,27.0,3.1.90,PRINCE EDWARD,"I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--"
83006,83007,Richard III,28.0,3.1.91,BUCKINGHAM,"What, my gracious lord?"
83007,83008,Richard III,29.0,3.1.92,PRINCE EDWARD,"An if I live until I be a man,"
83008,83009,Richard III,29.0,3.1.93,PRINCE EDWARD,"I'll win our ancient right in France again,"
83009,83010,Richard III,29.0,3.1.94,PRINCE EDWARD,"Or die a soldier, as I lived a king."
83010,83011,Richard III,30.0,3.1.95,GLOUCESTER,[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
83011,83012,Richard III,30.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL"
83012,83013,Richard III,31.0,3.1.96,BUCKINGHAM,"Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York."
83013,83014,Richard III,32.0,3.1.97,PRINCE EDWARD,Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
83014,83015,Richard III,33.0,3.1.98,YORK,"Well, my dread lord, so must I call you now."
83015,83016,Richard III,34.0,3.1.99,PRINCE EDWARD,"Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:"
83016,83017,Richard III,34.0,3.1.100,PRINCE EDWARD,"Too late he died that might have kept that title,"
83017,83018,Richard III,34.0,3.1.101,PRINCE EDWARD,Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
83018,83019,Richard III,35.0,3.1.102,GLOUCESTER,"How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?"
83019,83020,Richard III,36.0,3.1.103,YORK,"I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,"
83020,83021,Richard III,36.0,3.1.104,YORK,You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
83021,83022,Richard III,36.0,3.1.105,YORK,The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
83022,83023,Richard III,37.0,3.1.106,GLOUCESTER,"He hath, my lord."
83023,83024,Richard III,38.0,3.1.107,YORK,And therefore is he idle?
83024,83025,Richard III,39.0,3.1.108,GLOUCESTER,"O, my fair cousin, I must not say so."
83025,83026,Richard III,40.0,3.1.109,YORK,Then is he more beholding to you than I.
83026,83027,Richard III,41.0,3.1.110,GLOUCESTER,"He may command me as my sovereign,"
83027,83028,Richard III,41.0,3.1.111,GLOUCESTER,But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
83028,83029,Richard III,42.0,3.1.112,YORK,"I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger."
83029,83030,Richard III,43.0,3.1.113,GLOUCESTER,"My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart."
83030,83031,Richard III,44.0,3.1.114,PRINCE EDWARD,"A beggar, brother?"
83031,83032,Richard III,45.0,3.1.115,YORK,"Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,"
83032,83033,Richard III,45.0,3.1.116,YORK,"And being but a toy, which is no grief to give."
83033,83034,Richard III,46.0,3.1.117,GLOUCESTER,A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
83034,83035,Richard III,47.0,3.1.118,YORK,"A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it."
83035,83036,Richard III,48.0,3.1.119,GLOUCESTER,"A gentle cousin, were it light enough."
83036,83037,Richard III,49.0,3.1.120,YORK,"O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts,"
83037,83038,Richard III,49.0,3.1.121,YORK,In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
83038,83039,Richard III,50.0,3.1.122,GLOUCESTER,It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
83039,83040,Richard III,51.0,3.1.123,YORK,"I weigh it lightly, were it heavier."
83040,83041,Richard III,52.0,3.1.124,GLOUCESTER,"What, would you have my weapon, little lord?"
83041,83042,Richard III,53.0,3.1.125,YORK,"I would, that I might thank you as you call me."
83042,83043,Richard III,54.0,3.1.126,GLOUCESTER,How?
83043,83044,Richard III,55.0,3.1.127,YORK,Little.
83044,83045,Richard III,56.0,3.1.128,PRINCE EDWARD,My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
83045,83046,Richard III,56.0,3.1.129,PRINCE EDWARD,"Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him."
83046,83047,Richard III,57.0,3.1.130,YORK,"You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:"
83047,83048,Richard III,57.0,3.1.131,YORK,"Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me,"
83048,83049,Richard III,57.0,3.1.132,YORK,"Because that I am little, like an ape,"
83049,83050,Richard III,57.0,3.1.133,YORK,He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
83050,83051,Richard III,58.0,3.1.134,BUCKINGHAM,With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
83051,83052,Richard III,58.0,3.1.135,BUCKINGHAM,"To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,"
83052,83053,Richard III,58.0,3.1.136,BUCKINGHAM,He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
83053,83054,Richard III,58.0,3.1.137,BUCKINGHAM,So cunning and so young is wonderful.
83054,83055,Richard III,59.0,3.1.138,GLOUCESTER,"My lord, will't please you pass along?"
83055,83056,Richard III,59.0,3.1.139,GLOUCESTER,Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
83056,83057,Richard III,59.0,3.1.140,GLOUCESTER,"Will to your mother, to entreat of her"
83057,83058,Richard III,59.0,3.1.141,GLOUCESTER,To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
83058,83059,Richard III,60.0,3.1.142,YORK,"What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?"
83059,83060,Richard III,61.0,3.1.143,PRINCE EDWARD,My lord protector needs will have it so.
83060,83061,Richard III,62.0,3.1.144,YORK,I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
83061,83062,Richard III,63.0,3.1.145,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what should you fear?"
83062,83063,Richard III,64.0,3.1.146,YORK,"Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:"
83063,83064,Richard III,64.0,3.1.147,YORK,My grandam told me he was murdered there.
83064,83065,Richard III,65.0,3.1.148,PRINCE EDWARD,I fear no uncles dead.
83065,83066,Richard III,66.0,3.1.149,GLOUCESTER,"Nor none that live, I hope."
83066,83067,Richard III,67.0,3.1.150,PRINCE EDWARD,"An if they live, I hope I need not fear."
83067,83068,Richard III,67.0,3.1.151,PRINCE EDWARD,"But come, my lord, and with a heavy heart,"
83068,83069,Richard III,67.0,3.1.152,PRINCE EDWARD,"Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower."
83069,83070,Richard III,67.0,,PRINCE EDWARD,"A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY"
83070,83071,Richard III,68.0,3.1.153,BUCKINGHAM,"Think you, my lord, this little prating York"
83071,83072,Richard III,68.0,3.1.154,BUCKINGHAM,Was not incensed by his subtle mother
83072,83073,Richard III,68.0,3.1.155,BUCKINGHAM,To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
83073,83074,Richard III,69.0,3.1.156,GLOUCESTER,"No doubt, no doubt, O, 'tis a parlous boy,"
83074,83075,Richard III,69.0,3.1.157,GLOUCESTER,"Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable"
83075,83076,Richard III,69.0,3.1.158,GLOUCESTER,"He is all the mother's, from the top to toe."
83076,83077,Richard III,70.0,3.1.159,BUCKINGHAM,"Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby."
83077,83078,Richard III,70.0,3.1.160,BUCKINGHAM,Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
83078,83079,Richard III,70.0,3.1.161,BUCKINGHAM,As closely to conceal what we impart:
83079,83080,Richard III,70.0,3.1.162,BUCKINGHAM,"Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way,"
83080,83081,Richard III,70.0,3.1.163,BUCKINGHAM,What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
83081,83082,Richard III,70.0,3.1.164,BUCKINGHAM,"To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,"
83082,83083,Richard III,70.0,3.1.165,BUCKINGHAM,For the instalment of this noble duke
83083,83084,Richard III,70.0,3.1.166,BUCKINGHAM,In the seat royal of this famous isle?
83084,83085,Richard III,71.0,3.1.167,CATESBY,"He for his father's sake so loves the prince,"
83085,83086,Richard III,71.0,3.1.168,CATESBY,That he will not be won to aught against him.
83086,83087,Richard III,72.0,3.1.169,BUCKINGHAM,"What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?"
83087,83088,Richard III,73.0,3.1.170,CATESBY,He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
83088,83089,Richard III,74.0,3.1.171,BUCKINGHAM,"Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,"
83089,83090,Richard III,74.0,3.1.172,BUCKINGHAM,"And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,"
83090,83091,Richard III,74.0,3.1.173,BUCKINGHAM,"How doth he stand affected to our purpose,"
83091,83092,Richard III,74.0,3.1.174,BUCKINGHAM,"And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,"
83092,83093,Richard III,74.0,3.1.175,BUCKINGHAM,To sit about the coronation.
83093,83094,Richard III,74.0,3.1.176,BUCKINGHAM,"If thou dost find him tractable to us,"
83094,83095,Richard III,74.0,3.1.177,BUCKINGHAM,"Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:"
83095,83096,Richard III,74.0,3.1.178,BUCKINGHAM,"If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,"
83096,83097,Richard III,74.0,3.1.179,BUCKINGHAM,"Be thou so too, and so break off your talk,"
83097,83098,Richard III,74.0,3.1.180,BUCKINGHAM,And give us notice of his inclination:
83098,83099,Richard III,74.0,3.1.181,BUCKINGHAM,"For we to-morrow hold divided councils,"
83099,83100,Richard III,74.0,3.1.182,BUCKINGHAM,Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
83100,83101,Richard III,75.0,3.1.183,GLOUCESTER,"Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,"
83101,83102,Richard III,75.0,3.1.184,GLOUCESTER,His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
83102,83103,Richard III,75.0,3.1.185,GLOUCESTER,"To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle,"
83103,83104,Richard III,75.0,3.1.186,GLOUCESTER,"And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,"
83104,83105,Richard III,75.0,3.1.187,GLOUCESTER,Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
83105,83106,Richard III,76.0,3.1.188,BUCKINGHAM,"Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly."
83106,83107,Richard III,77.0,3.1.189,CATESBY,"My good lords both, with all the heed I may."
83107,83108,Richard III,78.0,3.1.190,GLOUCESTER,"Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?"
83108,83109,Richard III,79.0,3.1.191,CATESBY,"You shall, my lord."
83109,83110,Richard III,80.0,3.1.192,GLOUCESTER,"At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both."
83110,83111,Richard III,80.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit CATESBY
83111,83112,Richard III,81.0,3.1.193,BUCKINGHAM,"Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive"
83112,83113,Richard III,81.0,3.1.194,BUCKINGHAM,Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
83113,83114,Richard III,82.0,3.1.195,GLOUCESTER,"Chop off his head, man, somewhat we will do:"
83114,83115,Richard III,82.0,3.1.196,GLOUCESTER,"And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me"
83115,83116,Richard III,82.0,3.1.197,GLOUCESTER,"The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables"
83116,83117,Richard III,82.0,3.1.198,GLOUCESTER,Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
83117,83118,Richard III,83.0,3.1.199,BUCKINGHAM,I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
83118,83119,Richard III,84.0,3.1.200,GLOUCESTER,And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
83119,83120,Richard III,84.0,3.1.201,GLOUCESTER,"Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards"
83120,83121,Richard III,84.0,3.1.202,GLOUCESTER,We may digest our complots in some form.
83121,83122,Richard III,84.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exeunt
83122,83123,Richard III,84.0,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings' house.
83123,83124,Richard III,84.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter a Messenger
83124,83125,Richard III,1.0,3.2.1,Messenger,"What, ho! my lord!"
83125,83126,Richard III,2.0,3.2.2,HASTINGS,[Within]  Who knocks at the door?
83126,83127,Richard III,3.0,3.2.3,Messenger,A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
83127,83128,Richard III,3.0,,Messenger,Enter HASTINGS
83128,83129,Richard III,4.0,3.2.4,HASTINGS,What is't o'clock?
83129,83130,Richard III,5.0,3.2.5,Messenger,Upon the stroke of four.
83130,83131,Richard III,6.0,3.2.6,HASTINGS,Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
83131,83132,Richard III,7.0,3.2.7,Messenger,So it should seem by that I have to say.
83132,83133,Richard III,7.0,3.2.8,Messenger,"First, he commends him to your noble lordship."
83133,83134,Richard III,8.0,3.2.9,HASTINGS,And then?
83134,83135,Richard III,9.0,3.2.10,Messenger,And then he sends you word
83135,83136,Richard III,9.0,3.2.11,Messenger,He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
83136,83137,Richard III,9.0,3.2.12,Messenger,"Besides, he says there are two councils held,"
83137,83138,Richard III,9.0,3.2.13,Messenger,And that may be determined at the one
83138,83139,Richard III,9.0,3.2.14,Messenger,which may make you and him to rue at the other.
83139,83140,Richard III,9.0,3.2.15,Messenger,"Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,"
83140,83141,Richard III,9.0,3.2.16,Messenger,"If presently you will take horse with him,"
83141,83142,Richard III,9.0,3.2.17,Messenger,"And with all speed post with him toward the north,"
83142,83143,Richard III,9.0,3.2.18,Messenger,To shun the danger that his soul divines.
83143,83144,Richard III,10.0,3.2.19,HASTINGS,"Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord,"
83144,83145,Richard III,10.0,3.2.20,HASTINGS,Bid him not fear the separated councils
83145,83146,Richard III,10.0,3.2.21,HASTINGS,"His honour and myself are at the one,"
83146,83147,Richard III,10.0,3.2.22,HASTINGS,And at the other is my servant Catesby
83147,83148,Richard III,10.0,3.2.23,HASTINGS,Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
83148,83149,Richard III,10.0,3.2.24,HASTINGS,Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
83149,83150,Richard III,10.0,3.2.25,HASTINGS,"Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:"
83150,83151,Richard III,10.0,3.2.26,HASTINGS,"And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond"
83151,83152,Richard III,10.0,3.2.27,HASTINGS,To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
83152,83153,Richard III,10.0,3.2.28,HASTINGS,"To fly the boar before the boar pursues,"
83153,83154,Richard III,10.0,3.2.29,HASTINGS,Were to incense the boar to follow us
83154,83155,Richard III,10.0,3.2.30,HASTINGS,And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
83155,83156,Richard III,10.0,3.2.31,HASTINGS,"Go, bid thy master rise and come to me"
83156,83157,Richard III,10.0,3.2.32,HASTINGS,"And we will both together to the Tower,"
83157,83158,Richard III,10.0,3.2.33,HASTINGS,"Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly."
83158,83159,Richard III,11.0,3.2.34,Messenger,"My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say."
83159,83160,Richard III,11.0,,Messenger,Exit
83160,83161,Richard III,11.0,,Messenger,Enter CATESBY
83161,83162,Richard III,12.0,3.2.35,CATESBY,Many good morrows to my noble lord!
83162,83163,Richard III,13.0,3.2.36,HASTINGS,"Good morrow, Catesby, you are early stirring"
83163,83164,Richard III,13.0,3.2.37,HASTINGS,"What news, what news, in this our tottering state?"
83164,83165,Richard III,14.0,3.2.38,CATESBY,"It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord,"
83165,83166,Richard III,14.0,3.2.39,CATESBY,And I believe twill never stand upright
83166,83167,Richard III,14.0,3.2.40,CATESBY,Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
83167,83168,Richard III,15.0,3.2.41,HASTINGS,How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
83168,83169,Richard III,16.0,3.2.42,CATESBY,"Ay, my good lord."
83169,83170,Richard III,17.0,3.2.43,HASTINGS,I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
83170,83171,Richard III,17.0,3.2.44,HASTINGS,Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
83171,83172,Richard III,17.0,3.2.45,HASTINGS,But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
83172,83173,Richard III,18.0,3.2.46,CATESBY,"Ay, on my life, and hopes to find forward"
83173,83174,Richard III,18.0,3.2.47,CATESBY,Upon his party for the gain thereof:
83174,83175,Richard III,18.0,3.2.48,CATESBY,"And thereupon he sends you this good news,"
83175,83176,Richard III,18.0,3.2.49,CATESBY,"That this same very day your enemies,"
83176,83177,Richard III,18.0,3.2.50,CATESBY,"The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret."
83177,83178,Richard III,19.0,3.2.51,HASTINGS,"Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,"
83178,83179,Richard III,19.0,3.2.52,HASTINGS,Because they have been still mine enemies:
83179,83180,Richard III,19.0,3.2.53,HASTINGS,"But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,"
83180,83181,Richard III,19.0,3.2.54,HASTINGS,"To bar my master's heirs in true descent,"
83181,83182,Richard III,19.0,3.2.55,HASTINGS,"God knows I will not do it, to the death."
83182,83183,Richard III,20.0,3.2.56,CATESBY,God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
83183,83184,Richard III,21.0,3.2.57,HASTINGS,"But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,"
83184,83185,Richard III,21.0,3.2.58,HASTINGS,That they who brought me in my master's hate
83185,83186,Richard III,21.0,3.2.59,HASTINGS,I live to look upon their tragedy.
83186,83187,Richard III,21.0,3.2.60,HASTINGS,"I tell thee, Catesby--"
83187,83188,Richard III,22.0,3.2.61,CATESBY,"What, my lord?"
83188,83189,Richard III,23.0,3.2.62,HASTINGS,"Ere a fortnight make me elder,"
83189,83190,Richard III,23.0,3.2.63,HASTINGS,I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
83190,83191,Richard III,24.0,3.2.64,CATESBY,"'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,"
83191,83192,Richard III,24.0,3.2.65,CATESBY,When men are unprepared and look not for it.
83192,83193,Richard III,25.0,3.2.66,HASTINGS,"O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out"
83193,83194,Richard III,25.0,3.2.67,HASTINGS,"With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do"
83194,83195,Richard III,25.0,3.2.68,HASTINGS,"With some men else, who think themselves as safe"
83195,83196,Richard III,25.0,3.2.69,HASTINGS,"As thou and I, who, as thou know'st, are dear"
83196,83197,Richard III,25.0,3.2.70,HASTINGS,To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
83197,83198,Richard III,26.0,3.2.71,CATESBY,"The princes both make high account of you,"
83198,83199,Richard III,26.0,,CATESBY,Aside
83199,83200,Richard III,26.0,3.2.72,CATESBY,For they account his head upon the bridge.
83200,83201,Richard III,27.0,3.2.73,HASTINGS,"I know they do, and I have well deserved it."
83201,83202,Richard III,27.0,,HASTINGS,Enter STANLEY
83202,83203,Richard III,27.0,3.2.74,HASTINGS,"Come on, come on, where is your boar-spear, man?"
83203,83204,Richard III,27.0,3.2.75,HASTINGS,"Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?"
83204,83205,Richard III,28.0,3.2.76,STANLEY,"My lord, good morrow, good morrow, Catesby:"
83205,83206,Richard III,28.0,3.2.77,STANLEY,"You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,"
83206,83207,Richard III,28.0,3.2.78,STANLEY,"I do not like these several councils, I."
83207,83208,Richard III,29.0,3.2.79,HASTINGS,"My lord,"
83208,83209,Richard III,29.0,3.2.80,HASTINGS,"I hold my life as dear as you do yours,"
83209,83210,Richard III,29.0,3.2.81,HASTINGS,"And never in my life, I do protest,"
83210,83211,Richard III,29.0,3.2.82,HASTINGS,Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
83211,83212,Richard III,29.0,3.2.83,HASTINGS,"Think you, but that I know our state secure,"
83212,83213,Richard III,29.0,3.2.84,HASTINGS,I would be so triumphant as I am?
83213,83214,Richard III,30.0,3.2.85,STANLEY,"The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,"
83214,83215,Richard III,30.0,3.2.86,STANLEY,"Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,"
83215,83216,Richard III,30.0,3.2.87,STANLEY,"And they indeed had no cause to mistrust,"
83216,83217,Richard III,30.0,3.2.88,STANLEY,"But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast."
83217,83218,Richard III,30.0,3.2.89,STANLEY,This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
83218,83219,Richard III,30.0,3.2.90,STANLEY,"Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!"
83219,83220,Richard III,30.0,3.2.91,STANLEY,"What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent."
83220,83221,Richard III,31.0,3.2.92,HASTINGS,"Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?"
83221,83222,Richard III,31.0,3.2.93,HASTINGS,To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
83222,83223,Richard III,32.0,3.2.94,LORD STANLEY,"They, for their truth, might better wear their heads"
83223,83224,Richard III,32.0,3.2.95,LORD STANLEY,Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
83224,83225,Richard III,32.0,3.2.96,LORD STANLEY,"But come, my lord, let us away."
83225,83226,Richard III,32.0,,LORD STANLEY,Enter a Pursuivant
83226,83227,Richard III,33.0,3.2.97,HASTINGS,"Go on before, I'll talk with this good fellow."

83228,83229,Richard III,33.0,3.2.98,HASTINGS,"How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?"

83230,83231,Richard III,35.0,3.2.100,HASTINGS,"I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now"
83231,83232,Richard III,35.0,3.2.101,HASTINGS,Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
83232,83233,Richard III,35.0,3.2.102,HASTINGS,"Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,"
83233,83234,Richard III,35.0,3.2.103,HASTINGS,"By the suggestion of the queen's allies,"
83234,83235,Richard III,35.0,3.2.104,HASTINGS,"But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--"
83235,83236,Richard III,35.0,3.2.105,HASTINGS,"This day those enemies are put to death,"
83236,83237,Richard III,35.0,3.2.106,HASTINGS,And I in better state than e'er I was.
83237,83238,Richard III,36.0,3.2.107,Pursuivant,"God hold it, to your honour's good content!"
83238,83239,Richard III,37.0,3.2.108,HASTINGS,"Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me."

83245,83246,Richard III,40.0,3.2.112,HASTINGS,"I am in your debt for your last exercise,"
83246,83247,Richard III,40.0,3.2.113,HASTINGS,"Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you."
83247,83248,Richard III,40.0,,HASTINGS,He whispers in his ear
83248,83249,Richard III,40.0,,HASTINGS,Enter BUCKINGHAM

83251,83252,Richard III,41.0,3.2.116,BUCKINGHAM,Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
83252,83253,Richard III,42.0,3.2.117,HASTINGS,"Good faith, and when I met this holy man,"
83253,83254,Richard III,42.0,3.2.118,HASTINGS,Those men you talk of came into my mind.
83254,83255,Richard III,42.0,3.2.119,HASTINGS,"What, go you toward the Tower?"
83255,83256,Richard III,43.0,3.2.120,BUCKINGHAM,"I do, my lord, but long I shall not stay"
83256,83257,Richard III,43.0,3.2.121,BUCKINGHAM,I shall return before your lordship thence.
83257,83258,Richard III,44.0,3.2.122,HASTINGS,"'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there."
83258,83259,Richard III,45.0,3.2.123,BUCKINGHAM,"[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not."
83259,83260,Richard III,45.0,3.2.124,BUCKINGHAM,"Come, will you go?"
83260,83261,Richard III,46.0,3.2.125,HASTINGS,I'll wait upon your lordship.

83280,83281,Richard III,8.0,3.3.17,RIVERS,"Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,"
83281,83282,Richard III,8.0,3.3.18,RIVERS,"Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God"

83353,83354,Richard III,22.0,3.4.57,HASTINGS,For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
83354,83355,Richard III,23.0,3.4.58,DERBY,What of his heart perceive you in his face
83355,83356,Richard III,23.0,3.4.59,DERBY,By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
83356,83357,Richard III,24.0,3.4.60,HASTINGS,"Marry, that with no man here he is offended,"
83357,83358,Richard III,24.0,3.4.61,HASTINGS,"For, were he, he had shown it in his looks."
83358,83359,Richard III,25.0,3.4.62,DERBY,"I pray God he be not, I say."
83359,83360,Richard III,25.0,,DERBY,Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
83360,83361,Richard III,26.0,3.4.63,GLOUCESTER,"I pray you all, tell me what they deserve"
83361,83362,Richard III,26.0,3.4.64,GLOUCESTER,That do conspire my death with devilish plots
83362,83363,Richard III,26.0,3.4.65,GLOUCESTER,"Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd"
83363,83364,Richard III,26.0,3.4.66,GLOUCESTER,Upon my body with their hellish charms?
83364,83365,Richard III,27.0,3.4.67,HASTINGS,"The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,"
83365,83366,Richard III,27.0,3.4.68,HASTINGS,Makes me most forward in this noble presence
83366,83367,Richard III,27.0,3.4.69,HASTINGS,"To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be"
83367,83368,Richard III,27.0,3.4.70,HASTINGS,"I say, my lord, they have deserved death."
83368,83369,Richard III,28.0,3.4.71,GLOUCESTER,Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
83369,83370,Richard III,28.0,3.4.72,GLOUCESTER,"See how I am bewitch'd, behold mine arm"
83370,83371,Richard III,28.0,3.4.73,GLOUCESTER,"Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:"
83371,83372,Richard III,28.0,3.4.74,GLOUCESTER,"And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,"
83372,83373,Richard III,28.0,3.4.75,GLOUCESTER,"Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,"
83373,83374,Richard III,28.0,3.4.76,GLOUCESTER,That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
83374,83375,Richard III,29.0,3.4.77,HASTINGS,"If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--"
83375,83376,Richard III,30.0,3.4.78,GLOUCESTER,If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
83376,83377,Richard III,30.0,3.4.79,GLOUCESTER,Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
83377,83378,Richard III,30.0,3.4.80,GLOUCESTER,"Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,"
83378,83379,Richard III,30.0,3.4.81,GLOUCESTER,I will not dine until I see the same.
83379,83380,Richard III,30.0,3.4.82,GLOUCESTER,"Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:"
83380,83381,Richard III,30.0,3.4.83,GLOUCESTER,"The rest, that love me, rise and follow me."
83381,83382,Richard III,30.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL"
83382,83383,Richard III,31.0,3.4.84,HASTINGS,"Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me,"
83383,83384,Richard III,31.0,3.4.85,HASTINGS,"For I, too fond, might have prevented this."
83384,83385,Richard III,31.0,3.4.86,HASTINGS,"Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm,"
83385,83386,Richard III,31.0,3.4.87,HASTINGS,"But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:"
83386,83387,Richard III,31.0,3.4.88,HASTINGS,"Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,"
83387,83388,Richard III,31.0,3.4.89,HASTINGS,"And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,"
83388,83389,Richard III,31.0,3.4.90,HASTINGS,As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
83389,83390,Richard III,31.0,3.4.91,HASTINGS,"O, now I want the priest that spake to me:"
83390,83391,Richard III,31.0,3.4.92,HASTINGS,I now repent I told the pursuivant
83391,83392,Richard III,31.0,3.4.93,HASTINGS,"As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,"
83392,83393,Richard III,31.0,3.4.94,HASTINGS,"How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,"
83393,83394,Richard III,31.0,3.4.95,HASTINGS,And I myself secure in grace and favour.
83394,83395,Richard III,31.0,3.4.96,HASTINGS,"O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse"
83395,83396,Richard III,31.0,3.4.97,HASTINGS,Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
83396,83397,Richard III,32.0,3.4.98,RATCLIFF,"Dispatch, my lord, the duke would be at dinner:"
83397,83398,Richard III,32.0,3.4.99,RATCLIFF,"Make a short shrift, he longs to see your head."
83398,83399,Richard III,33.0,3.4.100,HASTINGS,"O momentary grace of mortal men,"
83399,83400,Richard III,33.0,3.4.101,HASTINGS,Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
83400,83401,Richard III,33.0,3.4.102,HASTINGS,"Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,"
83401,83402,Richard III,33.0,3.4.103,HASTINGS,"Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,"
83402,83403,Richard III,33.0,3.4.104,HASTINGS,"Ready, with every nod, to tumble down"
83403,83404,Richard III,33.0,3.4.105,HASTINGS,Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
83404,83405,Richard III,34.0,3.4.106,LOVEL,"Come, come, dispatch, 'tis bootless to exclaim."
83405,83406,Richard III,35.0,3.4.107,HASTINGS,O bloody Richard! miserable England!
83406,83407,Richard III,35.0,3.4.108,HASTINGS,I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
83407,83408,Richard III,35.0,3.4.109,HASTINGS,That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
83408,83409,Richard III,35.0,3.4.110,HASTINGS,"Come, lead me to the block, bear him my head."
83409,83410,Richard III,35.0,3.4.111,HASTINGS,They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
83410,83411,Richard III,35.0,,HASTINGS,Exeunt
83411,83412,Richard III,35.0,,HASTINGS,SCENE V. The Tower-walls.
83412,83413,Richard III,35.0,,HASTINGS,"Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured"
83413,83414,Richard III,1.0,3.5.1,GLOUCESTER,"Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,"
83414,83415,Richard III,1.0,3.5.2,GLOUCESTER,"Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,"
83415,83416,Richard III,1.0,3.5.3,GLOUCESTER,"And then begin again, and stop again,"
83416,83417,Richard III,1.0,3.5.4,GLOUCESTER,As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
83417,83418,Richard III,2.0,3.5.5,BUCKINGHAM,"Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,"
83418,83419,Richard III,2.0,3.5.6,BUCKINGHAM,"Speak and look back, and pry on every side,"
83419,83420,Richard III,2.0,3.5.7,BUCKINGHAM,"Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,"
83420,83421,Richard III,2.0,3.5.8,BUCKINGHAM,Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
83421,83422,Richard III,2.0,3.5.9,BUCKINGHAM,"Are at my service, like enforced smiles,"
83422,83423,Richard III,2.0,3.5.10,BUCKINGHAM,"And both are ready in their offices,"
83423,83424,Richard III,2.0,3.5.11,BUCKINGHAM,"At any time, to grace my stratagems."
83424,83425,Richard III,2.0,3.5.12,BUCKINGHAM,"But what, is Catesby gone?"
83425,83426,Richard III,3.0,3.5.13,GLOUCESTER,"He is, and, see, he brings the mayor along."
83426,83427,Richard III,3.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY
83427,83428,Richard III,4.0,3.5.14,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord mayor,--"
83428,83429,Richard III,5.0,3.5.15,GLOUCESTER,Look to the drawbridge there!
83429,83430,Richard III,6.0,3.5.16,BUCKINGHAM,Hark! a drum.
83430,83431,Richard III,7.0,3.5.17,GLOUCESTER,"Catesby, o'erlook the walls."
83431,83432,Richard III,8.0,3.5.18,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--"
83432,83433,Richard III,9.0,3.5.19,GLOUCESTER,"Look back, defend thee, here are enemies."
83433,83434,Richard III,10.0,3.5.20,BUCKINGHAM,God and our innocency defend and guard us!
83434,83435,Richard III,11.0,3.5.21,GLOUCESTER,"Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel."
83435,83436,Richard III,11.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head"
83436,83437,Richard III,12.0,3.5.22,LOVEL,"Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,"
83437,83438,Richard III,12.0,3.5.23,LOVEL,The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
83438,83439,Richard III,13.0,3.5.24,GLOUCESTER,"So dear I loved the man, that I must weep."
83439,83440,Richard III,13.0,3.5.25,GLOUCESTER,I took him for the plainest harmless creature
83440,83441,Richard III,13.0,3.5.26,GLOUCESTER,"That breathed upon this earth a Christian,"
83441,83442,Richard III,13.0,3.5.27,GLOUCESTER,Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
83442,83443,Richard III,13.0,3.5.28,GLOUCESTER,The history of all her secret thoughts:
83443,83444,Richard III,13.0,3.5.29,GLOUCESTER,"So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,"
83444,83445,Richard III,13.0,3.5.30,GLOUCESTER,"That, his apparent open guilt omitted,"
83445,83446,Richard III,13.0,3.5.31,GLOUCESTER,"I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,"
83446,83447,Richard III,13.0,3.5.32,GLOUCESTER,He lived from all attainder of suspect.
83447,83448,Richard III,14.0,3.5.33,BUCKINGHAM,"Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor"
83448,83449,Richard III,14.0,3.5.34,BUCKINGHAM,That ever lived.
83449,83450,Richard III,14.0,3.5.35,BUCKINGHAM,"Would you imagine, or almost believe,"
83450,83451,Richard III,14.0,3.5.36,BUCKINGHAM,"Were't not that, by great preservation,"
83451,83452,Richard III,14.0,3.5.37,BUCKINGHAM,"We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor"
83452,83453,Richard III,14.0,3.5.38,BUCKINGHAM,"This day had plotted, in the council-house"
83453,83454,Richard III,14.0,3.5.39,BUCKINGHAM,To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
83454,83455,Richard III,15.0,3.5.40,Lord Mayor,"What, had he so?"
83455,83456,Richard III,16.0,3.5.41,GLOUCESTER,"What, think You we are Turks or infidels?"
83456,83457,Richard III,16.0,3.5.42,GLOUCESTER,"Or that we would, against the form of law,"
83457,83458,Richard III,16.0,3.5.43,GLOUCESTER,"Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,"
83458,83459,Richard III,16.0,3.5.44,GLOUCESTER,"But that the extreme peril of the case,"
83459,83460,Richard III,16.0,3.5.45,GLOUCESTER,"The peace of England and our persons' safety,"
83460,83461,Richard III,16.0,3.5.46,GLOUCESTER,Enforced us to this execution?
83461,83462,Richard III,17.0,3.5.47,Lord Mayor,"Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death,"
83462,83463,Richard III,17.0,3.5.48,Lord Mayor,"And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,"
83463,83464,Richard III,17.0,3.5.49,Lord Mayor,To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
83464,83465,Richard III,17.0,3.5.50,Lord Mayor,"I never look'd for better at his hands,"
83465,83466,Richard III,17.0,3.5.51,Lord Mayor,After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
83466,83467,Richard III,18.0,3.5.52,GLOUCESTER,"Yet had not we determined he should die,"
83467,83468,Richard III,18.0,3.5.53,GLOUCESTER,"Until your lordship came to see his death,"
83468,83469,Richard III,18.0,3.5.54,GLOUCESTER,"Which now the loving haste of these our friends,"
83469,83470,Richard III,18.0,3.5.55,GLOUCESTER,"Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:"
83470,83471,Richard III,18.0,3.5.56,GLOUCESTER,"Because, my lord, we would have had you heard"
83471,83472,Richard III,18.0,3.5.57,GLOUCESTER,"The traitor speak, and timorously confess"
83472,83473,Richard III,18.0,3.5.58,GLOUCESTER,"The manner and the purpose of his treason,"
83473,83474,Richard III,18.0,3.5.59,GLOUCESTER,That you might well have signified the same
83474,83475,Richard III,18.0,3.5.60,GLOUCESTER,"Unto the citizens, who haply may"
83475,83476,Richard III,18.0,3.5.61,GLOUCESTER,Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
83476,83477,Richard III,19.0,3.5.62,Lord Mayor,"But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,"
83477,83478,Richard III,19.0,3.5.63,Lord Mayor,As well as I had seen and heard him speak
83478,83479,Richard III,19.0,3.5.64,Lord Mayor,"And doubt you not, right noble princes both,"
83479,83480,Richard III,19.0,3.5.65,Lord Mayor,But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
83480,83481,Richard III,19.0,3.5.66,Lord Mayor,With all your just proceedings in this cause.
83481,83482,Richard III,20.0,3.5.67,GLOUCESTER,"And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,"
83482,83483,Richard III,20.0,3.5.68,GLOUCESTER,To avoid the carping censures of the world.
83483,83484,Richard III,21.0,3.5.69,BUCKINGHAM,"But since you come too late of our intents,"
83484,83485,Richard III,21.0,3.5.70,BUCKINGHAM,Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
83485,83486,Richard III,21.0,3.5.71,BUCKINGHAM,"And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell."
83486,83487,Richard III,21.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Exit Lord Mayor
83487,83488,Richard III,22.0,3.5.72,GLOUCESTER,"Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham."
83488,83489,Richard III,22.0,3.5.73,GLOUCESTER,The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
83489,83490,Richard III,22.0,3.5.74,GLOUCESTER,"There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,"
83490,83491,Richard III,22.0,3.5.75,GLOUCESTER,Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
83491,83492,Richard III,22.0,3.5.76,GLOUCESTER,"Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,"
83492,83493,Richard III,22.0,3.5.77,GLOUCESTER,Only for saying he would make his son
83493,83494,Richard III,22.0,3.5.78,GLOUCESTER,"Heir to the crown, meaning indeed his house,"
83494,83495,Richard III,22.0,3.5.79,GLOUCESTER,"Which, by the sign thereof was termed so."
83495,83496,Richard III,22.0,3.5.80,GLOUCESTER,"Moreover, urge his hateful luxury"
83496,83497,Richard III,22.0,3.5.81,GLOUCESTER,"And bestial appetite in change of lust,"
83497,83498,Richard III,22.0,3.5.82,GLOUCESTER,"Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,"
83498,83499,Richard III,22.0,3.5.83,GLOUCESTER,"Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,"
83499,83500,Richard III,22.0,3.5.84,GLOUCESTER,"Without control, listed to make his prey."
83500,83501,Richard III,22.0,3.5.85,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:"
83501,83502,Richard III,22.0,3.5.86,GLOUCESTER,"Tell them, when that my mother went with child"
83502,83503,Richard III,22.0,3.5.87,GLOUCESTER,"Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York"
83503,83504,Richard III,22.0,3.5.88,GLOUCESTER,My princely father then had wars in France
83504,83505,Richard III,22.0,3.5.89,GLOUCESTER,"And, by just computation of the time,"
83505,83506,Richard III,22.0,3.5.90,GLOUCESTER,"Found that the issue was not his begot,"
83506,83507,Richard III,22.0,3.5.91,GLOUCESTER,"Which well appeared in his lineaments,"
83507,83508,Richard III,22.0,3.5.92,GLOUCESTER,Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
83508,83509,Richard III,22.0,3.5.93,GLOUCESTER,"But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,"
83509,83510,Richard III,22.0,3.5.94,GLOUCESTER,"Because you know, my lord, my mother lives."
83510,83511,Richard III,23.0,3.5.95,BUCKINGHAM,"Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator"
83511,83512,Richard III,23.0,3.5.96,BUCKINGHAM,As if the golden fee for which I plead
83512,83513,Richard III,23.0,3.5.97,BUCKINGHAM,"Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu."
83513,83514,Richard III,24.0,3.5.98,GLOUCESTER,"If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle,"
83514,83515,Richard III,24.0,3.5.99,GLOUCESTER,Where you shall find me well accompanied
83515,83516,Richard III,24.0,3.5.100,GLOUCESTER,With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
83516,83517,Richard III,25.0,3.5.101,BUCKINGHAM,I go: and towards three or four o'clock
83517,83518,Richard III,25.0,3.5.102,BUCKINGHAM,Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
83518,83519,Richard III,25.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Exit BUCKINGHAM
83519,83520,Richard III,26.0,3.5.103,GLOUCESTER,"Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw,"
83520,83521,Richard III,26.0,,GLOUCESTER,To CATESBY
83521,83522,Richard III,26.0,3.5.104,GLOUCESTER,"Go thou to Friar Penker, bid them both"
83522,83523,Richard III,26.0,3.5.105,GLOUCESTER,Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
83523,83524,Richard III,26.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
83524,83525,Richard III,26.0,3.5.106,GLOUCESTER,"Now will I in, to take some privy order,"
83525,83526,Richard III,26.0,3.5.107,GLOUCESTER,"To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,"
83526,83527,Richard III,26.0,3.5.108,GLOUCESTER,"And to give notice, that no manner of person"
83527,83528,Richard III,26.0,3.5.109,GLOUCESTER,At any time have recourse unto the princes.
83528,83529,Richard III,26.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit
83529,83530,Richard III,26.0,,GLOUCESTER,SCENE VI. The same.
83530,83531,Richard III,26.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand"
83531,83532,Richard III,1.0,3.6.1,Scrivener,"This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings,"
83532,83533,Richard III,1.0,3.6.2,Scrivener,"Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,"
83533,83534,Richard III,1.0,3.6.3,Scrivener,That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
83534,83535,Richard III,1.0,3.6.4,Scrivener,And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
83535,83536,Richard III,1.0,3.6.5,Scrivener,"Eleven hours I spent to write it over,"
83536,83537,Richard III,1.0,3.6.6,Scrivener,"For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me,"
83537,83538,Richard III,1.0,3.6.7,Scrivener,The precedent was full as long a-doing:
83538,83539,Richard III,1.0,3.6.8,Scrivener,"And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,"
83539,83540,Richard III,1.0,3.6.9,Scrivener,"Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty"
83540,83541,Richard III,1.0,3.6.10,Scrivener,"Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,"
83541,83542,Richard III,1.0,3.6.11,Scrivener,That seeth not this palpable device?
83542,83543,Richard III,1.0,3.6.12,Scrivener,"Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?"
83543,83544,Richard III,1.0,3.6.13,Scrivener,"Bad is the world, and all will come to nought,"
83544,83545,Richard III,1.0,3.6.14,Scrivener,When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
83545,83546,Richard III,1.0,,Scrivener,Exit
83546,83547,Richard III,1.0,,Scrivener,SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.
83547,83548,Richard III,1.0,,Scrivener,"Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors"
83548,83549,Richard III,1.0,3.7.1,GLOUCESTER,"How now, my lord, what say the citizens?"
83549,83550,Richard III,2.0,3.7.2,BUCKINGHAM,"Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,"
83550,83551,Richard III,2.0,3.7.3,BUCKINGHAM,The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
83551,83552,Richard III,3.0,3.7.4,GLOUCESTER,Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
83552,83553,Richard III,4.0,3.7.5,BUCKINGHAM,"I did, with his contract with Lady Lucy,"
83553,83554,Richard III,4.0,3.7.6,BUCKINGHAM,"And his contract by deputy in France,"
83554,83555,Richard III,4.0,3.7.7,BUCKINGHAM,"The insatiate greediness of his desires,"
83555,83556,Richard III,4.0,3.7.8,BUCKINGHAM,"And his enforcement of the city wives,"
83556,83557,Richard III,4.0,3.7.9,BUCKINGHAM,"His tyranny for trifles, his own bastardy,"
83557,83558,Richard III,4.0,3.7.10,BUCKINGHAM,"As being got, your father then in France,"
83558,83559,Richard III,4.0,3.7.11,BUCKINGHAM,"His resemblance, being not like the duke,"
83559,83560,Richard III,4.0,3.7.12,BUCKINGHAM,"Withal I did infer your lineaments,"
83560,83561,Richard III,4.0,3.7.13,BUCKINGHAM,"Being the right idea of your father,"
83561,83562,Richard III,4.0,3.7.14,BUCKINGHAM,"Both in your form and nobleness of mind,"
83562,83563,Richard III,4.0,3.7.15,BUCKINGHAM,"Laid open all your victories in Scotland,"
83563,83564,Richard III,4.0,3.7.16,BUCKINGHAM,"Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,"
83564,83565,Richard III,4.0,3.7.17,BUCKINGHAM,"Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:"
83565,83566,Richard III,4.0,3.7.18,BUCKINGHAM,"Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose"
83566,83567,Richard III,4.0,3.7.19,BUCKINGHAM,"Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse"
83567,83568,Richard III,4.0,3.7.20,BUCKINGHAM,And when mine oratory grew to an end
83568,83569,Richard III,4.0,3.7.21,BUCKINGHAM,I bid them that did love their country's good
83569,83570,Richard III,4.0,3.7.22,BUCKINGHAM,"Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'"
83570,83571,Richard III,5.0,3.7.23,GLOUCESTER,Ah! and did they so?
83571,83572,Richard III,6.0,3.7.24,BUCKINGHAM,"No, so God help me, they spake not a word,"
83572,83573,Richard III,6.0,3.7.25,BUCKINGHAM,"But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,"
83573,83574,Richard III,6.0,3.7.26,BUCKINGHAM,"Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale."
83574,83575,Richard III,6.0,3.7.27,BUCKINGHAM,"Which when I saw, I reprehended them,"
83575,83576,Richard III,6.0,3.7.28,BUCKINGHAM,And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
83576,83577,Richard III,6.0,3.7.29,BUCKINGHAM,"His answer was, the people were not wont"
83577,83578,Richard III,6.0,3.7.30,BUCKINGHAM,To be spoke to but by the recorder.
83578,83579,Richard III,6.0,3.7.31,BUCKINGHAM,"Then he was urged to tell my tale again,"
83579,83580,Richard III,6.0,3.7.32,BUCKINGHAM,"'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd,'"
83580,83581,Richard III,6.0,3.7.33,BUCKINGHAM,But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
83581,83582,Richard III,6.0,3.7.34,BUCKINGHAM,"When he had done, some followers of mine own,"
83582,83583,Richard III,6.0,3.7.35,BUCKINGHAM,"At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,"
83583,83584,Richard III,6.0,3.7.36,BUCKINGHAM,And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
83584,83585,Richard III,6.0,3.7.37,BUCKINGHAM,"And thus I took the vantage of those few,"
83585,83586,Richard III,6.0,3.7.38,BUCKINGHAM,"'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I,"
83586,83587,Richard III,6.0,3.7.39,BUCKINGHAM,'This general applause and loving shout
83587,83588,Richard III,6.0,3.7.40,BUCKINGHAM,Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
83588,83589,Richard III,6.0,3.7.41,BUCKINGHAM,"And even here brake off, and came away."
83589,83590,Richard III,7.0,3.7.42,GLOUCESTER,What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
83590,83591,Richard III,8.0,3.7.43,BUCKINGHAM,"No, by my troth, my lord."
83591,83592,Richard III,9.0,3.7.44,GLOUCESTER,Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
83592,83593,Richard III,10.0,3.7.45,BUCKINGHAM,"The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear,"
83593,83594,Richard III,10.0,3.7.46,BUCKINGHAM,"Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:"
83594,83595,Richard III,10.0,3.7.47,BUCKINGHAM,"And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,"
83595,83596,Richard III,10.0,3.7.48,BUCKINGHAM,"And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord,"
83596,83597,Richard III,10.0,3.7.49,BUCKINGHAM,For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
83597,83598,Richard III,10.0,3.7.50,BUCKINGHAM,And be not easily won to our request:
83598,83599,Richard III,10.0,3.7.51,BUCKINGHAM,"Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it."
83599,83600,Richard III,11.0,3.7.52,GLOUCESTER,"I go, and if you plead as well for them"
83600,83601,Richard III,11.0,3.7.53,GLOUCESTER,"As I can say nay to thee for myself,"
83601,83602,Richard III,11.0,3.7.54,GLOUCESTER,No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
83602,83603,Richard III,12.0,3.7.55,BUCKINGHAM,"Go, go, up to the leads, the lord mayor knocks."
83603,83604,Richard III,12.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Exit GLOUCESTER
83604,83605,Richard III,12.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens
83605,83606,Richard III,12.0,3.7.56,BUCKINGHAM,"Welcome my lord, I dance attendance here,"
83606,83607,Richard III,12.0,3.7.57,BUCKINGHAM,I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
83607,83608,Richard III,12.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Enter CATESBY
83608,83609,Richard III,12.0,3.7.58,BUCKINGHAM,"Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,"
83609,83610,Richard III,12.0,3.7.59,BUCKINGHAM,What says he?
83610,83611,Richard III,13.0,3.7.60,CATESBY,"My lord: he doth entreat your grace,"
83611,83612,Richard III,13.0,3.7.61,CATESBY,To visit him to-morrow or next day:
83612,83613,Richard III,13.0,3.7.62,CATESBY,"He is within, with two right reverend fathers,"
83613,83614,Richard III,13.0,3.7.63,CATESBY,"Divinely bent to meditation,"
83614,83615,Richard III,13.0,3.7.64,CATESBY,"And no worldly suit would he be moved,"
83615,83616,Richard III,13.0,3.7.65,CATESBY,To draw him from his holy exercise.
83616,83617,Richard III,14.0,3.7.66,BUCKINGHAM,"Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again,"
83617,83618,Richard III,14.0,3.7.67,BUCKINGHAM,"Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,"
83618,83619,Richard III,14.0,3.7.68,BUCKINGHAM,"In deep designs and matters of great moment,"
83619,83620,Richard III,14.0,3.7.69,BUCKINGHAM,"No less importing than our general good,"
83620,83621,Richard III,14.0,3.7.70,BUCKINGHAM,Are come to have some conference with his grace.
83621,83622,Richard III,15.0,3.7.71,CATESBY,"I'll tell him what you say, my lord."
83622,83623,Richard III,15.0,,CATESBY,Exit
83623,83624,Richard III,16.0,3.7.72,BUCKINGHAM,"Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!"
83624,83625,Richard III,16.0,3.7.73,BUCKINGHAM,"He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,"
83625,83626,Richard III,16.0,3.7.74,BUCKINGHAM,"But on his knees at meditation,"
83626,83627,Richard III,16.0,3.7.75,BUCKINGHAM,"Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,"
83627,83628,Richard III,16.0,3.7.76,BUCKINGHAM,"But meditating with two deep divines,"
83628,83629,Richard III,16.0,3.7.77,BUCKINGHAM,"Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,"
83629,83630,Richard III,16.0,3.7.78,BUCKINGHAM,"But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:"
83630,83631,Richard III,16.0,3.7.79,BUCKINGHAM,"Happy were England, would this gracious prince"
83631,83632,Richard III,16.0,3.7.80,BUCKINGHAM,Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
83632,83633,Richard III,16.0,3.7.81,BUCKINGHAM,"But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it."
83633,83634,Richard III,17.0,3.7.82,Lord Mayor,"Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!"
83634,83635,Richard III,18.0,3.7.83,BUCKINGHAM,I fear he will.
83635,83636,Richard III,18.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Re-enter CATESBY
83636,83637,Richard III,18.0,3.7.84,BUCKINGHAM,"How now, Catesby, what says your lord?"
83637,83638,Richard III,19.0,3.7.85,CATESBY,"My lord,"
83638,83639,Richard III,19.0,3.7.86,CATESBY,He wonders to what end you have assembled
83639,83640,Richard III,19.0,3.7.87,CATESBY,"Such troops of citizens to speak with him,"
83640,83641,Richard III,19.0,3.7.88,CATESBY,His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
83641,83642,Richard III,19.0,3.7.89,CATESBY,"My lord, he fears you mean no good to him."
83642,83643,Richard III,20.0,3.7.90,BUCKINGHAM,Sorry I am my noble cousin should
83643,83644,Richard III,20.0,3.7.91,BUCKINGHAM,"Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:"
83644,83645,Richard III,20.0,3.7.92,BUCKINGHAM,"By heaven, I come in perfect love to him,"
83645,83646,Richard III,20.0,3.7.93,BUCKINGHAM,And so once more return and tell his grace.
83646,83647,Richard III,20.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Exit CATESBY
83647,83648,Richard III,20.0,3.7.94,BUCKINGHAM,When holy and devout religious men
83648,83649,Richard III,20.0,3.7.95,BUCKINGHAM,"Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,"
83649,83650,Richard III,20.0,3.7.96,BUCKINGHAM,So sweet is zealous contemplation.
83650,83651,Richard III,20.0,,BUCKINGHAM,"Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns"
83651,83652,Richard III,21.0,3.7.97,Lord Mayor,"See, where he stands between two clergymen!"
83652,83653,Richard III,22.0,3.7.98,BUCKINGHAM,"Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,"
83653,83654,Richard III,22.0,3.7.99,BUCKINGHAM,To stay him from the fall of vanity:
83654,83655,Richard III,22.0,3.7.100,BUCKINGHAM,"And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,"
83655,83656,Richard III,22.0,3.7.101,BUCKINGHAM,True ornaments to know a holy man.
83656,83657,Richard III,22.0,3.7.102,BUCKINGHAM,"Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,"
83657,83658,Richard III,22.0,3.7.103,BUCKINGHAM,"Lend favourable ears to our request,"
83658,83659,Richard III,22.0,3.7.104,BUCKINGHAM,And pardon us the interruption
83659,83660,Richard III,22.0,3.7.105,BUCKINGHAM,Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
83660,83661,Richard III,23.0,3.7.106,GLOUCESTER,"My lord, there needs no such apology:"
83661,83662,Richard III,23.0,3.7.107,GLOUCESTER,"I rather do beseech you pardon me,"
83662,83663,Richard III,23.0,3.7.108,GLOUCESTER,"Who, earnest in the service of my God,"
83663,83664,Richard III,23.0,3.7.109,GLOUCESTER,Neglect the visitation of my friends.
83664,83665,Richard III,23.0,3.7.110,GLOUCESTER,"But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?"
83665,83666,Richard III,24.0,3.7.111,BUCKINGHAM,"Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,"
83666,83667,Richard III,24.0,3.7.112,BUCKINGHAM,And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
83667,83668,Richard III,25.0,3.7.113,GLOUCESTER,I do suspect I have done some offence
83668,83669,Richard III,25.0,3.7.114,GLOUCESTER,"That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,"
83669,83670,Richard III,25.0,3.7.115,GLOUCESTER,And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
83670,83671,Richard III,26.0,3.7.116,BUCKINGHAM,"You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,"
83671,83672,Richard III,26.0,3.7.117,BUCKINGHAM,"At our entreaties, to amend that fault!"
83672,83673,Richard III,27.0,3.7.118,GLOUCESTER,Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
83673,83674,Richard III,28.0,3.7.119,BUCKINGHAM,"Then know, it is your fault that you resign"
83674,83675,Richard III,28.0,3.7.120,BUCKINGHAM,"The supreme seat, the throne majestical,"
83675,83676,Richard III,28.0,3.7.121,BUCKINGHAM,"The scepter'd office of your ancestors,"
83676,83677,Richard III,28.0,3.7.122,BUCKINGHAM,"Your state of fortune and your due of birth,"
83677,83678,Richard III,28.0,3.7.123,BUCKINGHAM,"The lineal glory of your royal house,"
83678,83679,Richard III,28.0,3.7.124,BUCKINGHAM,To the corruption of a blemished stock:
83679,83680,Richard III,28.0,3.7.125,BUCKINGHAM,"Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,"
83680,83681,Richard III,28.0,3.7.126,BUCKINGHAM,"Which here we waken to our country's good,"
83681,83682,Richard III,28.0,3.7.127,BUCKINGHAM,"This noble isle doth want her proper limbs,"
83682,83683,Richard III,28.0,3.7.128,BUCKINGHAM,"Her face defaced with scars of infamy,"
83683,83684,Richard III,28.0,3.7.129,BUCKINGHAM,"Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,"
83684,83685,Richard III,28.0,3.7.130,BUCKINGHAM,And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
83685,83686,Richard III,28.0,3.7.131,BUCKINGHAM,Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
83686,83687,Richard III,28.0,3.7.132,BUCKINGHAM,"Which to recure, we heartily solicit"
83687,83688,Richard III,28.0,3.7.133,BUCKINGHAM,Your gracious self to take on you the charge
83688,83689,Richard III,28.0,3.7.134,BUCKINGHAM,"And kingly government of this your land,"
83689,83690,Richard III,28.0,3.7.135,BUCKINGHAM,"Not as protector, steward, substitute,"
83690,83691,Richard III,28.0,3.7.136,BUCKINGHAM,"Or lowly factor for another's gain,"
83691,83692,Richard III,28.0,3.7.137,BUCKINGHAM,"But as successively from blood to blood,"
83692,83693,Richard III,28.0,3.7.138,BUCKINGHAM,"Your right of birth, your empery, your own."
83693,83694,Richard III,28.0,3.7.139,BUCKINGHAM,"For this, consorted with the citizens,"
83694,83695,Richard III,28.0,3.7.140,BUCKINGHAM,"Your very worshipful and loving friends,"
83695,83696,Richard III,28.0,3.7.141,BUCKINGHAM,"And by their vehement instigation,"
83696,83697,Richard III,28.0,3.7.142,BUCKINGHAM,In this just suit come I to move your grace.
83697,83698,Richard III,29.0,3.7.143,GLOUCESTER,"I know not whether to depart in silence,"
83698,83699,Richard III,29.0,3.7.144,GLOUCESTER,Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
83699,83700,Richard III,29.0,3.7.145,GLOUCESTER,Best fitteth my degree or your condition
83700,83701,Richard III,29.0,3.7.146,GLOUCESTER,"If not to answer, you might haply think"
83701,83702,Richard III,29.0,3.7.147,GLOUCESTER,"Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded"
83702,83703,Richard III,29.0,3.7.148,GLOUCESTER,"To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,"
83703,83704,Richard III,29.0,3.7.149,GLOUCESTER,"Which fondly you would here impose on me,"
83704,83705,Richard III,29.0,3.7.150,GLOUCESTER,"If to reprove you for this suit of yours,"
83705,83706,Richard III,29.0,3.7.151,GLOUCESTER,So season'd with your faithful love to me.
83706,83707,Richard III,29.0,3.7.152,GLOUCESTER,"Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends."
83707,83708,Richard III,29.0,3.7.153,GLOUCESTER,"Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,"
83708,83709,Richard III,29.0,3.7.154,GLOUCESTER,"And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,"
83709,83710,Richard III,29.0,3.7.155,GLOUCESTER,Definitively thus I answer you.
83710,83711,Richard III,29.0,3.7.156,GLOUCESTER,"Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert"
83711,83712,Richard III,29.0,3.7.157,GLOUCESTER,Unmeritable shuns your high request.
83712,83713,Richard III,29.0,3.7.158,GLOUCESTER,"First if all obstacles were cut away,"
83713,83714,Richard III,29.0,3.7.159,GLOUCESTER,"And that my path were even to the crown,"
83714,83715,Richard III,29.0,3.7.160,GLOUCESTER,As my ripe revenue and due by birth
83715,83716,Richard III,29.0,3.7.161,GLOUCESTER,"Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,"
83716,83717,Richard III,29.0,3.7.162,GLOUCESTER,"So mighty and so many my defects,"
83717,83718,Richard III,29.0,3.7.163,GLOUCESTER,"As I had rather hide me from my greatness,"
83718,83719,Richard III,29.0,3.7.164,GLOUCESTER,"Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,"
83719,83720,Richard III,29.0,3.7.165,GLOUCESTER,"Than in my greatness covet to be hid,"
83720,83721,Richard III,29.0,3.7.166,GLOUCESTER,And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
83721,83722,Richard III,29.0,3.7.167,GLOUCESTER,"But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,"
83722,83723,Richard III,29.0,3.7.168,GLOUCESTER,"And much I need to help you, if need were,"
83723,83724,Richard III,29.0,3.7.169,GLOUCESTER,"The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,"
83724,83725,Richard III,29.0,3.7.170,GLOUCESTER,"Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,"
83725,83726,Richard III,29.0,3.7.171,GLOUCESTER,"Will well become the seat of majesty,"
83726,83727,Richard III,29.0,3.7.172,GLOUCESTER,"And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign."
83727,83728,Richard III,29.0,3.7.173,GLOUCESTER,"On him I lay what you would lay on me,"
83728,83729,Richard III,29.0,3.7.174,GLOUCESTER,"The right and fortune of his happy stars,"
83729,83730,Richard III,29.0,3.7.175,GLOUCESTER,Which God defend that I should wring from him!
83730,83731,Richard III,30.0,3.7.176,BUCKINGHAM,"My lord, this argues conscience in your grace,"
83731,83732,Richard III,30.0,3.7.177,BUCKINGHAM,"But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,"
83732,83733,Richard III,30.0,3.7.178,BUCKINGHAM,All circumstances well considered.
83733,83734,Richard III,30.0,3.7.179,BUCKINGHAM,You say that Edward is your brother's son:
83734,83735,Richard III,30.0,3.7.180,BUCKINGHAM,"So say we too, but not by Edward's wife,"
83735,83736,Richard III,30.0,3.7.181,BUCKINGHAM,For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
83736,83737,Richard III,30.0,3.7.182,BUCKINGHAM,Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
83737,83738,Richard III,30.0,3.7.183,BUCKINGHAM,And afterward by substitute betroth'd

83739,83740,Richard III,30.0,3.7.185,BUCKINGHAM,"These both put by a poor petitioner,"
83740,83741,Richard III,30.0,3.7.186,BUCKINGHAM,"A care-crazed mother of a many children,"
83741,83742,Richard III,30.0,3.7.187,BUCKINGHAM,"A beauty-waning and distressed widow,"

83745,83746,Richard III,30.0,3.7.191,BUCKINGHAM,To base declension and loathed bigamy
83746,83747,Richard III,30.0,3.7.192,BUCKINGHAM,"By her, in his unlawful bed, he got"
83747,83748,Richard III,30.0,3.7.193,BUCKINGHAM,"This Edward, whom our manners term the prince."

83749,83750,Richard III,30.0,3.7.195,BUCKINGHAM,"Save that, for reverence to some alive,"
83750,83751,Richard III,30.0,3.7.196,BUCKINGHAM,I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
83751,83752,Richard III,30.0,3.7.197,BUCKINGHAM,"Then, good my lord, take to your royal self"
83752,83753,Richard III,30.0,3.7.198,BUCKINGHAM,"This proffer'd benefit of dignity,"

83754,83755,Richard III,30.0,3.7.200,BUCKINGHAM,Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
83755,83756,Richard III,30.0,3.7.201,BUCKINGHAM,"From the corruption of abusing times,"
83756,83757,Richard III,30.0,3.7.202,BUCKINGHAM,Unto a lineal true-derived course.

83759,83760,Richard III,33.0,3.7.205,CATESBY,"O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!"
83760,83761,Richard III,34.0,3.7.206,GLOUCESTER,"Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?"
83761,83762,Richard III,34.0,3.7.207,GLOUCESTER,"I am unfit for state and majesty,"
83762,83763,Richard III,34.0,3.7.208,GLOUCESTER,"I do beseech you, take it not amiss,"
83763,83764,Richard III,34.0,3.7.209,GLOUCESTER,I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
83764,83765,Richard III,35.0,3.7.210,BUCKINGHAM,"If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,"

83767,83768,Richard III,35.0,3.7.213,BUCKINGHAM,"And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,"
83768,83769,Richard III,35.0,3.7.214,BUCKINGHAM,"Which we have noted in you to your kin,"
83769,83770,Richard III,35.0,3.7.215,BUCKINGHAM,"And egally indeed to all estates,--"
83770,83771,Richard III,35.0,3.7.216,BUCKINGHAM,"Yet whether you accept our suit or no,"
83771,83772,Richard III,35.0,3.7.217,BUCKINGHAM,"Your brother's son shall never reign our king,"
83772,83773,Richard III,35.0,3.7.218,BUCKINGHAM,"But we will plant some other in the throne,"
83773,83774,Richard III,35.0,3.7.219,BUCKINGHAM,To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
83774,83775,Richard III,35.0,3.7.220,BUCKINGHAM,And in this resolution here we leave you.--
83775,83776,Richard III,35.0,3.7.221,BUCKINGHAM,"Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more."

83780,83781,Richard III,39.0,3.7.225,GLOUCESTER,Would you enforce me to a world of care?
83781,83782,Richard III,39.0,3.7.226,GLOUCESTER,"Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,"
83782,83783,Richard III,39.0,3.7.227,GLOUCESTER,"But penetrable to your. kind entreats,"
83783,83784,Richard III,39.0,3.7.228,GLOUCESTER,Albeit against my conscience and my soul.

83788,83789,Richard III,39.0,3.7.232,GLOUCESTER,I must have patience to endure the load:
83789,83790,Richard III,39.0,3.7.233,GLOUCESTER,But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
83790,83791,Richard III,39.0,3.7.234,GLOUCESTER,"Attend the sequel of your imposition,"
83791,83792,Richard III,39.0,3.7.235,GLOUCESTER,Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me

83793,83794,Richard III,39.0,3.7.237,GLOUCESTER,"For God he knows, and you may partly see,"
83794,83795,Richard III,39.0,3.7.238,GLOUCESTER,How far I am from the desire thereof.
83795,83796,Richard III,40.0,3.7.239,Lord Mayor,"God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it."
83796,83797,Richard III,41.0,3.7.240,GLOUCESTER,"In saying so, you shall but say the truth."
83797,83798,Richard III,42.0,3.7.241,BUCKINGHAM,Then I salute you with this kingly title:

83882,83883,Richard III,23.0,4.1.69,LADY ANNE,When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
83883,83884,Richard III,23.0,4.1.70,LADY ANNE,Which issued from my other angel husband
83884,83885,Richard III,23.0,4.1.71,LADY ANNE,"And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd,"

83889,83890,Richard III,23.0,4.1.76,LADY ANNE,And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
83890,83891,Richard III,23.0,4.1.77,LADY ANNE,As miserable by the life of thee
83891,83892,Richard III,23.0,4.1.78,LADY ANNE,As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
83892,83893,Richard III,23.0,4.1.79,LADY ANNE,"Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,"
83893,83894,Richard III,23.0,4.1.80,LADY ANNE,"Even in so short a space, my woman's heart"
83894,83895,Richard III,23.0,4.1.81,LADY ANNE,Grossly grew captive to his honey words
83895,83896,Richard III,23.0,4.1.82,LADY ANNE,"And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,"
83896,83897,Richard III,23.0,4.1.83,LADY ANNE,"Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest,"
83897,83898,Richard III,23.0,4.1.84,LADY ANNE,For never yet one hour in his bed

84128,84129,Richard III,12.0,4.3.53,KING RICHARD III,Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.

84282,84283,Richard III,25.0,4.4.138,DUCHESS OF YORK,By strangling thee in her accursed womb
84283,84284,Richard III,25.0,4.4.139,DUCHESS OF YORK,"From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!"
84284,84285,Richard III,26.0,4.4.140,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,"
84285,84286,Richard III,26.0,4.4.141,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Where should be graven, if that right were right,"
84286,84287,Richard III,26.0,4.4.142,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,"
84287,84288,Richard III,26.0,4.4.143,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
84288,84289,Richard III,26.0,4.4.144,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?"
84289,84290,Richard III,27.0,4.4.145,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?"
84290,84291,Richard III,27.0,4.4.146,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?"
84291,84292,Richard III,28.0,4.4.147,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?"
84292,84293,Richard III,29.0,4.4.148,KING RICHARD III,"A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!"
84293,84294,Richard III,29.0,4.4.149,KING RICHARD III,Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
84294,84295,Richard III,29.0,4.4.150,KING RICHARD III,"Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!"
84295,84296,Richard III,29.0,,KING RICHARD III,Flourish. Alarums
84296,84297,Richard III,29.0,4.4.151,KING RICHARD III,"Either be patient, and entreat me fair,"
84297,84298,Richard III,29.0,4.4.152,KING RICHARD III,Or with the clamorous report of war
84298,84299,Richard III,29.0,4.4.153,KING RICHARD III,Thus will I drown your exclamations.
84299,84300,Richard III,30.0,4.4.154,DUCHESS OF YORK,Art thou my son?
84300,84301,Richard III,31.0,4.4.155,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself."
84301,84302,Richard III,32.0,4.4.156,DUCHESS OF YORK,Then patiently hear my impatience.
84302,84303,Richard III,33.0,4.4.157,KING RICHARD III,"Madam, I have a touch of your condition,"
84303,84304,Richard III,33.0,4.4.158,KING RICHARD III,Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
84304,84305,Richard III,34.0,4.4.159,DUCHESS OF YORK,"O, let me speak!"
84305,84306,Richard III,35.0,4.4.160,KING RICHARD III,Do then: but I'll not hear.
84306,84307,Richard III,36.0,4.4.161,DUCHESS OF YORK,I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
84307,84308,Richard III,37.0,4.4.162,KING RICHARD III,"And brief, good mother, for I am in haste."
84308,84309,Richard III,38.0,4.4.163,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,"
84309,84310,Richard III,38.0,4.4.164,DUCHESS OF YORK,"God knows, in anguish, pain and agony."
84310,84311,Richard III,39.0,4.4.165,KING RICHARD III,And came I not at last to comfort you?
84311,84312,Richard III,40.0,4.4.166,DUCHESS OF YORK,"No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,"
84312,84313,Richard III,40.0,4.4.167,DUCHESS OF YORK,Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
84313,84314,Richard III,40.0,4.4.168,DUCHESS OF YORK,"A grievous burthen was thy birth to me,"
84314,84315,Richard III,40.0,4.4.169,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy,"
84315,84316,Richard III,40.0,4.4.170,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,"
84316,84317,Richard III,40.0,4.4.171,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,"
84317,84318,Richard III,40.0,4.4.172,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,"
84318,84319,Richard III,40.0,4.4.173,DUCHESS OF YORK,"treacherous,"
84319,84320,Richard III,40.0,4.4.174,DUCHESS OF YORK,"More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:"
84320,84321,Richard III,40.0,4.4.175,DUCHESS OF YORK,"What comfortable hour canst thou name,"
84321,84322,Richard III,40.0,4.4.176,DUCHESS OF YORK,That ever graced me in thy company?
84322,84323,Richard III,41.0,4.4.177,KING RICHARD III,"Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd"
84323,84324,Richard III,41.0,4.4.178,KING RICHARD III,your grace
84324,84325,Richard III,41.0,4.4.179,KING RICHARD III,To breakfast once forth of my company.
84325,84326,Richard III,41.0,4.4.180,KING RICHARD III,"If I be so disgracious in your sight,"
84326,84327,Richard III,41.0,4.4.181,KING RICHARD III,"Let me march on, and not offend your grace."
84327,84328,Richard III,41.0,4.4.182,KING RICHARD III,Strike the drum.
84328,84329,Richard III,42.0,4.4.183,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I prithee, hear me speak."
84329,84330,Richard III,43.0,4.4.184,KING RICHARD III,You speak too bitterly.
84330,84331,Richard III,44.0,4.4.185,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Hear me a word,"
84331,84332,Richard III,44.0,4.4.186,DUCHESS OF YORK,For I shall never speak to thee again.
84332,84333,Richard III,45.0,4.4.187,KING RICHARD III,So.
84333,84334,Richard III,46.0,4.4.188,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,"
84334,84335,Richard III,46.0,4.4.189,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,"
84335,84336,Richard III,46.0,4.4.190,DUCHESS OF YORK,Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
84336,84337,Richard III,46.0,4.4.191,DUCHESS OF YORK,And never look upon thy face again.
84337,84338,Richard III,46.0,4.4.192,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse,"
84338,84339,Richard III,46.0,4.4.193,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more"
84339,84340,Richard III,46.0,4.4.194,DUCHESS OF YORK,Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
84340,84341,Richard III,46.0,4.4.195,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My prayers on the adverse party fight,"
84341,84342,Richard III,46.0,4.4.196,DUCHESS OF YORK,And there the little souls of Edward's children
84342,84343,Richard III,46.0,4.4.197,DUCHESS OF YORK,Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
84343,84344,Richard III,46.0,4.4.198,DUCHESS OF YORK,And promise them success and victory.
84344,84345,Richard III,46.0,4.4.199,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end,"
84345,84346,Richard III,46.0,4.4.200,DUCHESS OF YORK,Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
84346,84347,Richard III,46.0,,DUCHESS OF YORK,Exit
84347,84348,Richard III,47.0,4.4.201,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse"
84348,84349,Richard III,47.0,4.4.202,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Abides in me, I say amen to all."
84349,84350,Richard III,48.0,4.4.203,KING RICHARD III,"Stay, madam, I must speak a word with you."
84350,84351,Richard III,49.0,4.4.204,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I have no more sons of the royal blood
84351,84352,Richard III,49.0,4.4.205,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,"
84352,84353,Richard III,49.0,4.4.206,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,"
84353,84354,Richard III,49.0,4.4.207,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And therefore level not to hit their lives.
84354,84355,Richard III,50.0,4.4.208,KING RICHARD III,"You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,"
84355,84356,Richard III,50.0,4.4.209,KING RICHARD III,"Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious."
84356,84357,Richard III,51.0,4.4.210,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And must she die for this? O, let her live,"
84357,84358,Richard III,51.0,4.4.211,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,"
84358,84359,Richard III,51.0,4.4.212,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,"
84359,84360,Richard III,51.0,4.4.213,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Throw over her the veil of infamy:
84360,84361,Richard III,51.0,4.4.214,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,"
84361,84362,Richard III,51.0,4.4.215,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
84362,84363,Richard III,52.0,4.4.216,KING RICHARD III,"Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood."
84363,84364,Richard III,53.0,4.4.217,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To save her life, I'll say she is not so."
84364,84365,Richard III,54.0,4.4.218,KING RICHARD III,Her life is only safest in her birth.
84365,84366,Richard III,55.0,4.4.219,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And only in that safety died her brothers.
84366,84367,Richard III,56.0,4.4.220,KING RICHARD III,"Lo, at their births good stars were opposite."
84367,84368,Richard III,57.0,4.4.221,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"No, to their lives bad friends were contrary."
84368,84369,Richard III,58.0,4.4.222,KING RICHARD III,All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
84369,84370,Richard III,59.0,4.4.223,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"True, when avoided grace makes destiny:"
84370,84371,Richard III,59.0,4.4.224,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"My babes were destined to a fairer death,"
84371,84372,Richard III,59.0,4.4.225,QUEEN ELIZABETH,If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
84372,84373,Richard III,60.0,4.4.226,KING RICHARD III,You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
84373,84374,Richard III,61.0,4.4.227,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozen'd"
84374,84375,Richard III,61.0,4.4.228,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life."
84375,84376,Richard III,61.0,4.4.229,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,"
84376,84377,Richard III,61.0,4.4.230,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:"
84377,84378,Richard III,61.0,4.4.231,QUEEN ELIZABETH,No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
84378,84379,Richard III,61.0,4.4.232,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,"
84379,84380,Richard III,61.0,4.4.233,QUEEN ELIZABETH,To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
84380,84381,Richard III,61.0,4.4.234,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,"
84381,84382,Richard III,61.0,4.4.235,QUEEN ELIZABETH,My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
84382,84383,Richard III,61.0,4.4.236,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes,"
84383,84384,Richard III,61.0,4.4.237,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And I, in such a desperate bay of death,"
84384,84385,Richard III,61.0,4.4.238,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,"
84385,84386,Richard III,61.0,4.4.239,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
84386,84387,Richard III,62.0,4.4.240,KING RICHARD III,"Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise"
84387,84388,Richard III,62.0,4.4.241,KING RICHARD III,"And dangerous success of bloody wars,"
84388,84389,Richard III,62.0,4.4.242,KING RICHARD III,"As I intend more good to you and yours,"
84389,84390,Richard III,62.0,4.4.243,KING RICHARD III,Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
84390,84391,Richard III,63.0,4.4.244,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,"
84391,84392,Richard III,63.0,4.4.245,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To be discover'd, that can do me good?"
84392,84393,Richard III,64.0,4.4.246,KING RICHARD III,"The advancement of your children, gentle lady."
84393,84394,Richard III,65.0,4.4.247,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?"
84394,84395,Richard III,66.0,4.4.248,KING RICHARD III,"No, to the dignity and height of honour"
84395,84396,Richard III,66.0,4.4.249,KING RICHARD III,The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
84396,84397,Richard III,67.0,4.4.250,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Flatter my sorrows with report of it,"
84397,84398,Richard III,67.0,4.4.251,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,"
84398,84399,Richard III,67.0,4.4.252,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
84399,84400,Richard III,68.0,4.4.253,KING RICHARD III,"Even all I have, yea, and myself and all,"
84400,84401,Richard III,68.0,4.4.254,KING RICHARD III,"Will I withal endow a child of thine,"
84401,84402,Richard III,68.0,4.4.255,KING RICHARD III,So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
84402,84403,Richard III,68.0,4.4.256,KING RICHARD III,Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
84403,84404,Richard III,68.0,4.4.257,KING RICHARD III,Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
84404,84405,Richard III,69.0,4.4.258,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness"
84405,84406,Richard III,69.0,4.4.259,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
84406,84407,Richard III,70.0,4.4.260,KING RICHARD III,"Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter."
84407,84408,Richard III,71.0,4.4.261,QUEEN ELIZABETH,My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
84408,84409,Richard III,72.0,4.4.262,KING RICHARD III,What do you think?
84409,84410,Richard III,73.0,4.4.263,QUEEN ELIZABETH,That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
84410,84411,Richard III,73.0,4.4.264,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,"
84411,84412,Richard III,73.0,4.4.265,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
84412,84413,Richard III,74.0,4.4.266,KING RICHARD III,Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
84413,84414,Richard III,74.0,4.4.267,KING RICHARD III,"I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,"
84414,84415,Richard III,74.0,4.4.268,KING RICHARD III,And mean to make her queen of England.
84415,84416,Richard III,75.0,4.4.269,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?"
84416,84417,Richard III,76.0,4.4.270,KING RICHARD III,Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
84417,84418,Richard III,77.0,4.4.271,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"What, thou?"
84418,84419,Richard III,78.0,4.4.272,KING RICHARD III,"I, even I: what think you of it, madam?"
84419,84420,Richard III,79.0,4.4.273,QUEEN ELIZABETH,How canst thou woo her?
84420,84421,Richard III,80.0,4.4.274,KING RICHARD III,"That would I learn of you,"
84421,84422,Richard III,80.0,4.4.275,KING RICHARD III,As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
84422,84423,Richard III,81.0,4.4.276,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And wilt thou learn of me?
84423,84424,Richard III,82.0,4.4.277,KING RICHARD III,"Madam, with all my heart."
84424,84425,Richard III,83.0,4.4.278,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,"
84425,84426,Richard III,83.0,4.4.279,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A pair of bleeding-hearts, thereon engrave"
84426,84427,Richard III,83.0,4.4.280,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Edward and York, then haply she will weep:"
84427,84428,Richard III,83.0,4.4.281,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
84428,84429,Richard III,83.0,4.4.282,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--"
84429,84430,Richard III,83.0,4.4.283,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"A handkerchief, which, say to her, did drain"
84430,84431,Richard III,83.0,4.4.284,QUEEN ELIZABETH,The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
84431,84432,Richard III,83.0,4.4.285,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
84432,84433,Richard III,83.0,4.4.286,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If this inducement force her not to love,"
84433,84434,Richard III,83.0,4.4.287,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Send her a story of thy noble acts,"
84434,84435,Richard III,83.0,4.4.288,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,"
84435,84436,Richard III,83.0,4.4.289,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Her uncle Rivers, yea, and, for her sake,"
84436,84437,Richard III,83.0,4.4.290,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
84437,84438,Richard III,84.0,4.4.291,KING RICHARD III,"Come, come, you mock me, this is not the way"
84438,84439,Richard III,84.0,4.4.292,KING RICHARD III,To win our daughter.
84439,84440,Richard III,85.0,4.4.293,QUEEN ELIZABETH,There is no other way
84440,84441,Richard III,85.0,4.4.294,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,"
84441,84442,Richard III,85.0,4.4.295,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And not be Richard that hath done all this.
84442,84443,Richard III,86.0,4.4.296,KING RICHARD III,Say that I did all this for love of her.
84443,84444,Richard III,87.0,4.4.297,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,"
84444,84445,Richard III,87.0,4.4.298,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
84445,84446,Richard III,88.0,4.4.299,KING RICHARD III,"Look, what is done cannot be now amended:"
84446,84447,Richard III,88.0,4.4.300,KING RICHARD III,"Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,"
84447,84448,Richard III,88.0,4.4.301,KING RICHARD III,Which after hours give leisure to repent.
84448,84449,Richard III,88.0,4.4.302,KING RICHARD III,"If I did take the kingdom from your sons,"
84449,84450,Richard III,88.0,4.4.303,KING RICHARD III,"To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter."
84450,84451,Richard III,88.0,4.4.304,KING RICHARD III,"If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,"
84451,84452,Richard III,88.0,4.4.305,KING RICHARD III,"To quicken your increase, I will beget"
84452,84453,Richard III,88.0,4.4.306,KING RICHARD III,Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
84453,84454,Richard III,88.0,4.4.307,KING RICHARD III,A grandam's name is little less in love
84454,84455,Richard III,88.0,4.4.308,KING RICHARD III,"Than is the doting title of a mother,"
84455,84456,Richard III,88.0,4.4.309,KING RICHARD III,"They are as children but one step below,"
84456,84457,Richard III,88.0,4.4.310,KING RICHARD III,"Even of your mettle, of your very blood,"
84457,84458,Richard III,88.0,4.4.311,KING RICHARD III,"Of an one pain, save for a night of groans"
84458,84459,Richard III,88.0,4.4.312,KING RICHARD III,"Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow."
84459,84460,Richard III,88.0,4.4.313,KING RICHARD III,"Your children were vexation to your youth,"
84460,84461,Richard III,88.0,4.4.314,KING RICHARD III,But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
84461,84462,Richard III,88.0,4.4.315,KING RICHARD III,"The loss you have is but a son being king,"
84462,84463,Richard III,88.0,4.4.316,KING RICHARD III,And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
84463,84464,Richard III,88.0,4.4.317,KING RICHARD III,"I cannot make you what amends I would,"
84464,84465,Richard III,88.0,4.4.318,KING RICHARD III,Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
84465,84466,Richard III,88.0,4.4.319,KING RICHARD III,"Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul"
84466,84467,Richard III,88.0,4.4.320,KING RICHARD III,"Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,"
84467,84468,Richard III,88.0,4.4.321,KING RICHARD III,This fair alliance quickly shall call home
84468,84469,Richard III,88.0,4.4.322,KING RICHARD III,To high promotions and great dignity:
84469,84470,Richard III,88.0,4.4.323,KING RICHARD III,"The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife."
84470,84471,Richard III,88.0,4.4.324,KING RICHARD III,"Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother,"
84471,84472,Richard III,88.0,4.4.325,KING RICHARD III,"Again shall you be mother to a king,"
84472,84473,Richard III,88.0,4.4.326,KING RICHARD III,And all the ruins of distressful times
84473,84474,Richard III,88.0,4.4.327,KING RICHARD III,Repair'd with double riches of content.
84474,84475,Richard III,88.0,4.4.328,KING RICHARD III,What! we have many goodly days to see:
84475,84476,Richard III,88.0,4.4.329,KING RICHARD III,The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
84476,84477,Richard III,88.0,4.4.330,KING RICHARD III,"Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,"
84477,84478,Richard III,88.0,4.4.331,KING RICHARD III,Advantaging their loan with interest
84478,84479,Richard III,88.0,4.4.332,KING RICHARD III,Of ten times double gain of happiness.
84479,84480,Richard III,88.0,4.4.333,KING RICHARD III,"Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go"
84480,84481,Richard III,88.0,4.4.334,KING RICHARD III,"Make bold her bashful years with your experience,"
84481,84482,Richard III,88.0,4.4.335,KING RICHARD III,Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
84482,84483,Richard III,88.0,4.4.336,KING RICHARD III,Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
84483,84484,Richard III,88.0,4.4.337,KING RICHARD III,"Of golden sovereignty, acquaint the princess"
84484,84485,Richard III,88.0,4.4.338,KING RICHARD III,With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
84485,84486,Richard III,88.0,4.4.339,KING RICHARD III,And when this arm of mine hath chastised
84486,84487,Richard III,88.0,4.4.340,KING RICHARD III,"The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,"
84487,84488,Richard III,88.0,4.4.341,KING RICHARD III,Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
84488,84489,Richard III,88.0,4.4.342,KING RICHARD III,"And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed,"
84489,84490,Richard III,88.0,4.4.343,KING RICHARD III,"To whom I will retail my conquest won,"
84490,84491,Richard III,88.0,4.4.344,KING RICHARD III,"And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar."
84491,84492,Richard III,89.0,4.4.345,QUEEN ELIZABETH,What were I best to say? her father's brother
84492,84493,Richard III,89.0,4.4.346,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?"
84493,84494,Richard III,89.0,4.4.347,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?"
84494,84495,Richard III,89.0,4.4.348,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Under what title shall I woo for thee,"
84495,84496,Richard III,89.0,4.4.349,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That God, the law, my honour and her love,"
84496,84497,Richard III,89.0,4.4.350,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
84497,84498,Richard III,90.0,4.4.351,KING RICHARD III,Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
84498,84499,Richard III,91.0,4.4.352,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
84499,84500,Richard III,92.0,4.4.353,KING RICHARD III,"Say that the king, which may command, entreats."
84500,84501,Richard III,93.0,4.4.354,QUEEN ELIZABETH,That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
84501,84502,Richard III,94.0,4.4.355,KING RICHARD III,"Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen."
84502,84503,Richard III,95.0,4.4.356,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"To wail the tide, as her mother doth."
84503,84504,Richard III,96.0,4.4.357,KING RICHARD III,"Say, I will love her everlastingly."
84504,84505,Richard III,97.0,4.4.358,QUEEN ELIZABETH,But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
84505,84506,Richard III,98.0,4.4.359,KING RICHARD III,Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
84506,84507,Richard III,99.0,4.4.360,QUEEN ELIZABETH,But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
84507,84508,Richard III,100.0,4.4.361,KING RICHARD III,So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
84508,84509,Richard III,101.0,4.4.362,QUEEN ELIZABETH,So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
84509,84510,Richard III,102.0,4.4.363,KING RICHARD III,"Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love."
84510,84511,Richard III,103.0,4.4.364,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty."
84511,84512,Richard III,104.0,4.4.365,KING RICHARD III,Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
84512,84513,Richard III,105.0,4.4.366,QUEEN ELIZABETH,An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
84513,84514,Richard III,106.0,4.4.367,KING RICHARD III,Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
84514,84515,Richard III,107.0,4.4.368,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
84515,84516,Richard III,108.0,4.4.369,KING RICHARD III,Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
84516,84517,Richard III,109.0,4.4.370,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"O no, my reasons are too deep and dead,"
84517,84518,Richard III,109.0,4.4.371,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave."
84518,84519,Richard III,110.0,4.4.372,KING RICHARD III,"Harp not on that string, madam, that is past."
84519,84520,Richard III,111.0,4.4.373,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
84520,84521,Richard III,112.0,4.4.374,KING RICHARD III,"Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--"
84521,84522,Richard III,113.0,4.4.375,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd."
84522,84523,Richard III,114.0,4.4.376,KING RICHARD III,I swear--
84523,84524,Richard III,115.0,4.4.377,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"By nothing, for this is no oath:"
84524,84525,Richard III,115.0,4.4.378,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour,"
84525,84526,Richard III,115.0,4.4.379,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue,"
84526,84527,Richard III,115.0,4.4.380,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory."
84527,84528,Richard III,115.0,4.4.381,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"if something thou wilt swear to be believed,"
84528,84529,Richard III,115.0,4.4.382,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
84529,84530,Richard III,116.0,4.4.383,KING RICHARD III,"Now, by the world--"
84530,84531,Richard III,117.0,4.4.384,QUEEN ELIZABETH,'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
84531,84532,Richard III,118.0,4.4.385,KING RICHARD III,My father's death--
84532,84533,Richard III,119.0,4.4.386,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
84533,84534,Richard III,120.0,4.4.387,KING RICHARD III,"Then, by myself--"
84534,84535,Richard III,121.0,4.4.388,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Thyself thyself misusest.
84535,84536,Richard III,122.0,4.4.389,KING RICHARD III,"Why then, by God--"
84536,84537,Richard III,123.0,4.4.390,QUEEN ELIZABETH,God's wrong is most of all.
84537,84538,Richard III,123.0,4.4.391,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,"
84538,84539,Richard III,123.0,4.4.392,QUEEN ELIZABETH,The unity the king thy brother made
84539,84540,Richard III,123.0,4.4.393,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:"
84540,84541,Richard III,123.0,4.4.394,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,"
84541,84542,Richard III,123.0,4.4.395,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,"
84542,84543,Richard III,123.0,4.4.396,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Had graced the tender temples of my child,"
84543,84544,Richard III,123.0,4.4.397,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"And both the princes had been breathing here,"
84544,84545,Richard III,123.0,4.4.398,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,"
84545,84546,Richard III,123.0,4.4.399,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
84546,84547,Richard III,123.0,4.4.400,QUEEN ELIZABETH,What canst thou swear by now?
84547,84548,Richard III,124.0,4.4.401,KING RICHARD III,The time to come.
84548,84549,Richard III,125.0,4.4.402,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast,"
84549,84550,Richard III,125.0,4.4.403,QUEEN ELIZABETH,For I myself have many tears to wash
84550,84551,Richard III,125.0,4.4.404,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee."
84551,84552,Richard III,125.0,4.4.405,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The children live, whose parents thou hast"
84552,84553,Richard III,125.0,4.4.406,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"slaughter'd,"
84553,84554,Richard III,125.0,4.4.407,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age,"
84554,84555,Richard III,125.0,4.4.408,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,"
84555,84556,Richard III,125.0,4.4.409,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age."
84556,84557,Richard III,125.0,4.4.410,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast"
84557,84558,Richard III,125.0,4.4.411,QUEEN ELIZABETH,"Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast."
84558,84559,Richard III,126.0,4.4.412,KING RICHARD III,"As I intend to prosper and repent,"
84559,84560,Richard III,126.0,4.4.413,KING RICHARD III,So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
84560,84561,Richard III,126.0,4.4.414,KING RICHARD III,Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
84561,84562,Richard III,126.0,4.4.415,KING RICHARD III,Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
84562,84563,Richard III,126.0,4.4.416,KING RICHARD III,"Day, yield me not thy light, nor, night, thy rest!"
84563,84564,Richard III,126.0,4.4.417,KING RICHARD III,Be opposite all planets of good luck
84564,84565,Richard III,126.0,4.4.418,KING RICHARD III,"To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,"
84565,84566,Richard III,126.0,4.4.419,KING RICHARD III,"Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,"
84566,84567,Richard III,126.0,4.4.420,KING RICHARD III,I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
84567,84568,Richard III,126.0,4.4.421,KING RICHARD III,"In her consists my happiness and thine,"
84568,84569,Richard III,126.0,4.4.422,KING RICHARD III,"Without her, follows to this land and me,"
84569,84570,Richard III,126.0,4.4.423,KING RICHARD III,"To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,"
84570,84571,Richard III,126.0,4.4.424,KING RICHARD III,"Death, desolation, ruin and decay:"
84571,84572,Richard III,126.0,4.4.425,KING RICHARD III,"It cannot be avoided but by this,"
84572,84573,Richard III,126.0,4.4.426,KING RICHARD III,It will not be avoided but by this.
84573,84574,Richard III,126.0,4.4.427,KING RICHARD III,"Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--"
84574,84575,Richard III,126.0,4.4.428,KING RICHARD III,Be the attorney of my love to her:
84575,84576,Richard III,126.0,4.4.429,KING RICHARD III,"Plead what I will be, not what I have been,"
84576,84577,Richard III,126.0,4.4.430,KING RICHARD III,"Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:"
84577,84578,Richard III,126.0,4.4.431,KING RICHARD III,"Urge the necessity and state of times,"
84578,84579,Richard III,126.0,4.4.432,KING RICHARD III,And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
84579,84580,Richard III,127.0,4.4.433,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
84580,84581,Richard III,128.0,4.4.434,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good."
84581,84582,Richard III,129.0,4.4.435,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Shall I forget myself to be myself?
84582,84583,Richard III,130.0,4.4.436,KING RICHARD III,"Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself."
84583,84584,Richard III,131.0,4.4.437,QUEEN ELIZABETH,But thou didst kill my children.
84584,84585,Richard III,132.0,4.4.438,KING RICHARD III,But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
84585,84586,Richard III,132.0,4.4.439,KING RICHARD III,Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
84586,84587,Richard III,132.0,4.4.440,KING RICHARD III,"Selves of themselves, to your recomforture."
84587,84588,Richard III,133.0,4.4.441,QUEEN ELIZABETH,Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
84588,84589,Richard III,134.0,4.4.442,KING RICHARD III,And be a happy mother by the deed.
84589,84590,Richard III,135.0,4.4.443,QUEEN ELIZABETH,I go. Write to me very shortly.
84590,84591,Richard III,135.0,4.4.444,QUEEN ELIZABETH,And you shall understand from me her mind.
84591,84592,Richard III,136.0,4.4.445,KING RICHARD III,"Bear her my true love's kiss, and so, farewell."
84592,84593,Richard III,136.0,,KING RICHARD III,Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH

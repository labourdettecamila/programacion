46257,46258,Julius Caesar,26.0,,BASTARD,SCENE I. Rome. A street.
46258,46259,Julius Caesar,26.0,,BASTARD,"Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners"
46259,46260,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.1.1,FLAVIUS,"Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:"
46260,46261,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.1.2,FLAVIUS,"Is this a holiday? what! know you not,"
46261,46262,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.1.3,FLAVIUS,"Being mechanical, you ought not walk"
46262,46263,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.1.4,FLAVIUS,Upon a labouring day without the sign
46263,46264,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.1.5,FLAVIUS,"Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?"
46264,46265,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.1.6,First Commoner,"Why, sir, a carpenter."
46265,46266,Julius Caesar,3.0,1.1.7,MARULLUS,Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
46266,46267,Julius Caesar,3.0,1.1.8,MARULLUS,What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
46267,46268,Julius Caesar,3.0,1.1.9,MARULLUS,"You, sir, what trade are you?"
46268,46269,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.1.10,Second Commoner,"Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,"
46269,46270,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.1.11,Second Commoner,"as you would say, a cobbler."
46270,46271,Julius Caesar,5.0,1.1.12,MARULLUS,But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
46271,46272,Julius Caesar,6.0,1.1.13,Second Commoner,"A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe"
46272,46273,Julius Caesar,6.0,1.1.14,Second Commoner,"conscience, which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles."
46273,46274,Julius Caesar,7.0,1.1.15,MARULLUS,"What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?"
46274,46275,Julius Caesar,8.0,1.1.16,Second Commoner,"Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,"
46275,46276,Julius Caesar,8.0,1.1.17,Second Commoner,"if you be out, sir, I can mend you."
46276,46277,Julius Caesar,9.0,1.1.18,MARULLUS,"What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!"
46277,46278,Julius Caesar,10.0,1.1.19,Second Commoner,"Why, sir, cobble you."
46278,46279,Julius Caesar,11.0,1.1.20,FLAVIUS,"Thou art a cobbler, art thou?"
46279,46280,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.1.21,Second Commoner,"Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I"
46280,46281,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.1.22,Second Commoner,"meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's"
46281,46282,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.1.23,Second Commoner,"matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon"
46282,46283,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.1.24,Second Commoner,"to old shoes, when they are in great danger, I"
46283,46284,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.1.25,Second Commoner,recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
46284,46285,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.1.26,Second Commoner,neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
46285,46286,Julius Caesar,13.0,1.1.27,FLAVIUS,But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
46286,46287,Julius Caesar,13.0,1.1.28,FLAVIUS,Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
46287,46288,Julius Caesar,14.0,1.1.29,Second Commoner,"Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself"
46288,46289,Julius Caesar,14.0,1.1.30,Second Commoner,"into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,"
46289,46290,Julius Caesar,14.0,1.1.31,Second Commoner,to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
46290,46291,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.32,MARULLUS,Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
46291,46292,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.33,MARULLUS,"What tributaries follow him to Rome,"
46292,46293,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.34,MARULLUS,To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
46293,46294,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.35,MARULLUS,"You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!"
46294,46295,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.36,MARULLUS,"O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,"
46295,46296,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.37,MARULLUS,Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
46296,46297,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.38,MARULLUS,"Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,"
46297,46298,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.39,MARULLUS,"To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,"
46298,46299,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.40,MARULLUS,"Your infants in your arms, and there have sat"
46299,46300,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.41,MARULLUS,"The livelong day, with patient expectation,"
46300,46301,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.42,MARULLUS,To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
46301,46302,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.43,MARULLUS,"And when you saw his chariot but appear,"
46302,46303,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.44,MARULLUS,"Have you not made an universal shout,"
46303,46304,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.45,MARULLUS,"That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,"
46304,46305,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.46,MARULLUS,To hear the replication of your sounds
46305,46306,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.47,MARULLUS,Made in her concave shores?
46306,46307,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.48,MARULLUS,And do you now put on your best attire?
46307,46308,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.49,MARULLUS,And do you now cull out a holiday?
46308,46309,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.50,MARULLUS,And do you now strew flowers in his way
46309,46310,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.51,MARULLUS,That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
46310,46311,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.52,MARULLUS,"Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,"
46311,46312,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.53,MARULLUS,Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
46312,46313,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.1.54,MARULLUS,That needs must light on this ingratitude.
46313,46314,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.55,FLAVIUS,"Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,"
46314,46315,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.56,FLAVIUS,"Assemble all the poor men of your sort,"
46315,46316,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.57,FLAVIUS,"Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears"
46316,46317,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.58,FLAVIUS,"Into the channel, till the lowest stream"
46317,46318,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.59,FLAVIUS,Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
46318,46319,Julius Caesar,16.0,,FLAVIUS,Exeunt all the Commoners
46319,46320,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.60,FLAVIUS,"See whether their basest metal be not moved,"
46320,46321,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.61,FLAVIUS,They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
46321,46322,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.1.62,FLAVIUS,"Go you down that way towards the Capitol,"
46322,46323,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.1.63,FLAVIUS,"This way will I disrobe the images,"
46323,46324,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.1.64,FLAVIUS,If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
46324,46325,Julius Caesar,18.0,1.1.65,MARULLUS,May we do so?
46325,46326,Julius Caesar,18.0,1.1.66,MARULLUS,You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
46326,46327,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.67,FLAVIUS,"It is no matter, let no images"
46327,46328,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.68,FLAVIUS,"Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,"
46328,46329,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.69,FLAVIUS,And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
46329,46330,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.70,FLAVIUS,"So do you too, where you perceive them thick."
46330,46331,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.71,FLAVIUS,These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
46331,46332,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.72,FLAVIUS,"Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,"
46332,46333,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.73,FLAVIUS,Who else would soar above the view of men
46333,46334,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.1.74,FLAVIUS,And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
46334,46335,Julius Caesar,19.0,,FLAVIUS,Exeunt
46335,46336,Julius Caesar,19.0,,FLAVIUS,SCENE II. A public place.
46336,46337,Julius Caesar,19.0,,FLAVIUS,"Flourish. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, for the course,  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA, a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer"
46337,46338,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.2.1,CAESAR,Calpurnia!
46338,46339,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.2.2,CASCA,"Peace, ho! Caesar speaks."
46339,46340,Julius Caesar,3.0,1.2.3,CAESAR,Calpurnia!
46340,46341,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.2.4,CALPURNIA,"Here, my lord."
46341,46342,Julius Caesar,5.0,1.2.5,CAESAR,"Stand you directly in Antonius' way,"
46342,46343,Julius Caesar,5.0,1.2.6,CAESAR,When he doth run his course. Antonius!
46343,46344,Julius Caesar,6.0,1.2.7,ANTONY,"Caesar, my lord?"
46344,46345,Julius Caesar,7.0,1.2.8,CAESAR,"Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,"
46345,46346,Julius Caesar,7.0,1.2.9,CAESAR,"To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say,"
46346,46347,Julius Caesar,7.0,1.2.10,CAESAR,"The barren, touched in this holy chase,"
46347,46348,Julius Caesar,7.0,1.2.11,CAESAR,Shake off their sterile curse.
46348,46349,Julius Caesar,8.0,1.2.12,ANTONY,I shall remember:
46349,46350,Julius Caesar,8.0,1.2.13,ANTONY,"When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd."
46350,46351,Julius Caesar,9.0,1.2.14,CAESAR,"Set on, and leave no ceremony out."
46351,46352,Julius Caesar,9.0,,CAESAR,Flourish
46352,46353,Julius Caesar,10.0,1.2.15,Soothsayer,Caesar!
46353,46354,Julius Caesar,11.0,1.2.16,CAESAR,Ha! who calls?
46354,46355,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.2.17,CASCA,Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
46355,46356,Julius Caesar,13.0,1.2.18,CAESAR,Who is it in the press that calls on me?
46356,46357,Julius Caesar,13.0,1.2.19,CAESAR,"I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,"
46357,46358,Julius Caesar,13.0,1.2.20,CAESAR,"Cry 'Caesar!' Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear."
46358,46359,Julius Caesar,14.0,1.2.21,Soothsayer,Beware the ides of March.
46359,46360,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.2.22,CAESAR,What man is that?
46360,46361,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.2.23,BRUTUS,A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
46361,46362,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.2.24,CAESAR,"Set him before me, let me see his face."
46362,46363,Julius Caesar,18.0,1.2.25,CASSIUS,"Fellow, come from the throng, look upon Caesar."
46363,46364,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.2.26,CAESAR,What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
46364,46365,Julius Caesar,20.0,1.2.27,Soothsayer,Beware the ides of March.
46365,46366,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.2.28,CAESAR,"He is a dreamer, let us leave him: pass."
46366,46367,Julius Caesar,21.0,,CAESAR,Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS
46367,46368,Julius Caesar,22.0,1.2.29,CASSIUS,Will you go see the order of the course?
46368,46369,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.2.30,BRUTUS,Not I.
46369,46370,Julius Caesar,24.0,1.2.31,CASSIUS,"I pray you, do."
46370,46371,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.2.32,BRUTUS,I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
46371,46372,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.2.33,BRUTUS,Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
46372,46373,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.2.34,BRUTUS,"Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires,"
46373,46374,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.2.35,BRUTUS,I'll leave you.
46374,46375,Julius Caesar,26.0,1.2.36,CASSIUS,"Brutus, I do observe you now of late:"
46375,46376,Julius Caesar,26.0,1.2.37,CASSIUS,I have not from your eyes that gentleness
46376,46377,Julius Caesar,26.0,1.2.38,CASSIUS,And show of love as I was wont to have:
46377,46378,Julius Caesar,26.0,1.2.39,CASSIUS,You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
46378,46379,Julius Caesar,26.0,1.2.40,CASSIUS,Over your friend that loves you.
46379,46380,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.41,BRUTUS,"Cassius,"
46380,46381,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.42,BRUTUS,"Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,"
46381,46382,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.43,BRUTUS,I turn the trouble of my countenance
46382,46383,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.44,BRUTUS,Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
46383,46384,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.45,BRUTUS,"Of late with passions of some difference,"
46384,46385,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.46,BRUTUS,"Conceptions only proper to myself,"
46385,46386,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.47,BRUTUS,"Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors,"
46386,46387,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.48,BRUTUS,But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
46387,46388,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.49,BRUTUS,"Among which number, Cassius, be you one--"
46388,46389,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.50,BRUTUS,"Nor construe any further my neglect,"
46389,46390,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.51,BRUTUS,"Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,"
46390,46391,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.2.52,BRUTUS,Forgets the shows of love to other men.
46391,46392,Julius Caesar,28.0,1.2.53,CASSIUS,"Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,"
46392,46393,Julius Caesar,28.0,1.2.54,CASSIUS,By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
46393,46394,Julius Caesar,28.0,1.2.55,CASSIUS,"Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations."
46394,46395,Julius Caesar,28.0,1.2.56,CASSIUS,"Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?"
46395,46396,Julius Caesar,29.0,1.2.57,BRUTUS,"No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself,"
46396,46397,Julius Caesar,29.0,1.2.58,BRUTUS,"But by reflection, by some other things."
46397,46398,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.59,CASSIUS,'Tis just:
46398,46399,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.60,CASSIUS,"And it is very much lamented, Brutus,"
46399,46400,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.61,CASSIUS,That you have no such mirrors as will turn
46400,46401,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.62,CASSIUS,"Your hidden worthiness into your eye,"
46401,46402,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.63,CASSIUS,"That you might see your shadow. I have heard,"
46402,46403,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.64,CASSIUS,"Where many of the best respect in Rome,"
46403,46404,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.65,CASSIUS,"Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus"
46404,46405,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.66,CASSIUS,"And groaning underneath this age's yoke,"
46405,46406,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.2.67,CASSIUS,Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
46406,46407,Julius Caesar,31.0,1.2.68,BRUTUS,"Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,"
46407,46408,Julius Caesar,31.0,1.2.69,BRUTUS,That you would have me seek into myself
46408,46409,Julius Caesar,31.0,1.2.70,BRUTUS,For that which is not in me?
46409,46410,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.71,CASSIUS,"Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:"
46410,46411,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.72,CASSIUS,And since you know you cannot see yourself
46411,46412,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.73,CASSIUS,"So well as by reflection, I, your glass,"
46412,46413,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.74,CASSIUS,Will modestly discover to yourself
46413,46414,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.75,CASSIUS,That of yourself which you yet know not of.
46414,46415,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.76,CASSIUS,"And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:"
46415,46416,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.77,CASSIUS,"Were I a common laugher, or did use"
46416,46417,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.78,CASSIUS,To stale with ordinary oaths my love
46417,46418,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.79,CASSIUS,"To every new protester, if you know"
46418,46419,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.80,CASSIUS,That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
46419,46420,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.81,CASSIUS,"And after scandal them, or if you know"
46420,46421,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.82,CASSIUS,That I profess myself in banqueting
46421,46422,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.2.83,CASSIUS,"To all the rout, then hold me dangerous."
46422,46423,Julius Caesar,32.0,,CASSIUS,"Flourish, and shout"
46423,46424,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.2.84,BRUTUS,"What means this shouting? I do fear, the people"
46424,46425,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.2.85,BRUTUS,Choose Caesar for their king.
46425,46426,Julius Caesar,34.0,1.2.86,CASSIUS,"Ay, do you fear it?"
46426,46427,Julius Caesar,34.0,1.2.87,CASSIUS,Then must I think you would not have it so.
46427,46428,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.88,BRUTUS,"I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well."
46428,46429,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.89,BRUTUS,But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
46429,46430,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.90,BRUTUS,What is it that you would impart to me?
46430,46431,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.91,BRUTUS,"If it be aught toward the general good,"
46431,46432,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.92,BRUTUS,"Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,"
46432,46433,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.93,BRUTUS,"And I will look on both indifferently,"
46433,46434,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.94,BRUTUS,For let the gods so speed me as I love
46434,46435,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.2.95,BRUTUS,The name of honour more than I fear death.
46435,46436,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.96,CASSIUS,"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,"
46436,46437,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.97,CASSIUS,As well as I do know your outward favour.
46437,46438,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.98,CASSIUS,"Well, honour is the subject of my story."
46438,46439,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.99,CASSIUS,I cannot tell what you and other men
46439,46440,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.100,CASSIUS,"Think of this life, but, for my single self,"
46440,46441,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.101,CASSIUS,I had as lief not be as live to be
46441,46442,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.102,CASSIUS,In awe of such a thing as I myself.
46442,46443,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.103,CASSIUS,"I was born free as Caesar, so were you:"
46443,46444,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.104,CASSIUS,"We both have fed as well, and we can both"
46444,46445,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.105,CASSIUS,Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
46445,46446,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.106,CASSIUS,"For once, upon a raw and gusty day,"
46446,46447,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.107,CASSIUS,"The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,"
46447,46448,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.108,CASSIUS,"Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now"
46448,46449,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.109,CASSIUS,"Leap in with me into this angry flood,"
46449,46450,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.110,CASSIUS,"And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,"
46450,46451,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.111,CASSIUS,"Accoutred as I was, I plunged in"
46451,46452,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.112,CASSIUS,"And bade him follow, so indeed he did."
46452,46453,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.113,CASSIUS,"The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it"
46453,46454,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.114,CASSIUS,"With lusty sinews, throwing it aside"
46454,46455,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.115,CASSIUS,"And stemming it with hearts of controversy,"
46455,46456,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.116,CASSIUS,"But ere we could arrive the point proposed,"
46456,46457,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.117,CASSIUS,"Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'"
46457,46458,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.118,CASSIUS,"I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,"
46458,46459,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.119,CASSIUS,Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
46459,46460,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.120,CASSIUS,"The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber"
46460,46461,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.121,CASSIUS,Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
46461,46462,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.122,CASSIUS,"Is now become a god, and Cassius is"
46462,46463,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.123,CASSIUS,"A wretched creature and must bend his body,"
46463,46464,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.124,CASSIUS,If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
46464,46465,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.125,CASSIUS,"He had a fever when he was in Spain,"
46465,46466,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.126,CASSIUS,"And when the fit was on him, I did mark"
46466,46467,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.127,CASSIUS,"How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake,"
46467,46468,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.128,CASSIUS,"His coward lips did from their colour fly,"
46468,46469,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.129,CASSIUS,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
46469,46470,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.130,CASSIUS,Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
46470,46471,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.131,CASSIUS,"Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans"
46471,46472,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.132,CASSIUS,"Mark him and write his speeches in their books,"
46472,46473,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.133,CASSIUS,"Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'"
46473,46474,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.134,CASSIUS,"As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me"
46474,46475,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.135,CASSIUS,A man of such a feeble temper should
46475,46476,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.136,CASSIUS,So get the start of the majestic world
46476,46477,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.2.137,CASSIUS,And bear the palm alone.
46477,46478,Julius Caesar,36.0,,CASSIUS,Shout. Flourish
46478,46479,Julius Caesar,37.0,1.2.138,BRUTUS,Another general shout!
46479,46480,Julius Caesar,37.0,1.2.139,BRUTUS,I do believe that these applauses are
46480,46481,Julius Caesar,37.0,1.2.140,BRUTUS,For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
46481,46482,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.141,CASSIUS,"Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world"
46482,46483,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.142,CASSIUS,"Like a Colossus, and we petty men"
46483,46484,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.143,CASSIUS,Walk under his huge legs and peep about
46484,46485,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.144,CASSIUS,To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
46485,46486,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.145,CASSIUS,Men at some time are masters of their fates:
46486,46487,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.146,CASSIUS,"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,"
46487,46488,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.147,CASSIUS,"But in ourselves, that we are underlings."
46488,46489,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.148,CASSIUS,Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
46489,46490,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.149,CASSIUS,Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
46490,46491,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.150,CASSIUS,"Write them together, yours is as fair a name,"
46491,46492,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.151,CASSIUS,"Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well,"
46492,46493,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.152,CASSIUS,"Weigh them, it is as heavy, conjure with 'em,"
46493,46494,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.153,CASSIUS,Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
46494,46495,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.154,CASSIUS,"Now, in the names of all the gods at once,"
46495,46496,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.155,CASSIUS,"Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,"
46496,46497,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.156,CASSIUS,"That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!"
46497,46498,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.157,CASSIUS,"Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!"
46498,46499,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.158,CASSIUS,"When went there by an age, since the great flood,"
46499,46500,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.159,CASSIUS,But it was famed with more than with one man?
46500,46501,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.160,CASSIUS,"When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,"
46501,46502,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.161,CASSIUS,That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
46502,46503,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.162,CASSIUS,"Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,"
46503,46504,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.163,CASSIUS,When there is in it but one only man.
46504,46505,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.164,CASSIUS,"O, you and I have heard our fathers say,"
46505,46506,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.165,CASSIUS,There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
46506,46507,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.166,CASSIUS,The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
46507,46508,Julius Caesar,38.0,1.2.167,CASSIUS,As easily as a king.
46508,46509,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.168,BRUTUS,"That you do love me, I am nothing jealous,"
46509,46510,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.169,BRUTUS,"What you would work me to, I have some aim:"
46510,46511,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.170,BRUTUS,"How I have thought of this and of these times,"
46511,46512,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.171,BRUTUS,"I shall recount hereafter, for this present,"
46512,46513,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.172,BRUTUS,"I would not, so with love I might entreat you,"
46513,46514,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.173,BRUTUS,Be any further moved. What you have said
46514,46515,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.174,BRUTUS,"I will consider, what you have to say"
46515,46516,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.175,BRUTUS,"I will with patience hear, and find a time"
46516,46517,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.176,BRUTUS,Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
46517,46518,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.177,BRUTUS,"Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:"
46518,46519,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.178,BRUTUS,Brutus had rather be a villager
46519,46520,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.179,BRUTUS,Than to repute himself a son of Rome
46520,46521,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.180,BRUTUS,Under these hard conditions as this time
46521,46522,Julius Caesar,39.0,1.2.181,BRUTUS,Is like to lay upon us.
46522,46523,Julius Caesar,40.0,1.2.182,CASSIUS,I am glad that my weak words
46523,46524,Julius Caesar,40.0,1.2.183,CASSIUS,Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
46524,46525,Julius Caesar,41.0,1.2.184,BRUTUS,The games are done and Caesar is returning.
46525,46526,Julius Caesar,42.0,1.2.185,CASSIUS,"As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,"
46526,46527,Julius Caesar,42.0,1.2.186,CASSIUS,"And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you"
46527,46528,Julius Caesar,42.0,1.2.187,CASSIUS,What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
46528,46529,Julius Caesar,42.0,,CASSIUS,Re-enter CAESAR and his Train
46529,46530,Julius Caesar,43.0,1.2.188,BRUTUS,"I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,"
46530,46531,Julius Caesar,43.0,1.2.189,BRUTUS,"The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,"
46531,46532,Julius Caesar,43.0,1.2.190,BRUTUS,And all the rest look like a chidden train:
46532,46533,Julius Caesar,43.0,1.2.191,BRUTUS,"Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero"
46533,46534,Julius Caesar,43.0,1.2.192,BRUTUS,Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
46534,46535,Julius Caesar,43.0,1.2.193,BRUTUS,"As we have seen him in the Capitol,"
46535,46536,Julius Caesar,43.0,1.2.194,BRUTUS,Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
46536,46537,Julius Caesar,44.0,1.2.195,CASSIUS,Casca will tell us what the matter is.
46537,46538,Julius Caesar,45.0,1.2.196,CAESAR,Antonius!
46538,46539,Julius Caesar,46.0,1.2.197,ANTONY,Caesar?
46539,46540,Julius Caesar,47.0,1.2.198,CAESAR,"Let me have men about me that are fat,"
46540,46541,Julius Caesar,47.0,1.2.199,CAESAR,Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
46541,46542,Julius Caesar,47.0,1.2.200,CAESAR,"Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look,"
46542,46543,Julius Caesar,47.0,1.2.201,CAESAR,He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
46543,46544,Julius Caesar,48.0,1.2.202,ANTONY,"Fear him not, Caesar, he's not dangerous,"
46544,46545,Julius Caesar,48.0,1.2.203,ANTONY,He is a noble Roman and well given.
46545,46546,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.204,CAESAR,Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
46546,46547,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.205,CAESAR,"Yet if my name were liable to fear,"
46547,46548,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.206,CAESAR,I do not know the man I should avoid
46548,46549,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.207,CAESAR,"So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,"
46549,46550,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.208,CAESAR,He is a great observer and he looks
46550,46551,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.209,CAESAR,"Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,"
46551,46552,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.210,CAESAR,"As thou dost, Antony, he hears no music,"
46552,46553,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.211,CAESAR,"Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort"
46553,46554,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.212,CAESAR,As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
46554,46555,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.213,CAESAR,That could be moved to smile at any thing.
46555,46556,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.214,CAESAR,Such men as he be never at heart's ease
46556,46557,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.215,CAESAR,"Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,"
46557,46558,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.216,CAESAR,And therefore are they very dangerous.
46558,46559,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.217,CAESAR,I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
46559,46560,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.218,CAESAR,"Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar."
46560,46561,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.219,CAESAR,"Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,"
46561,46562,Julius Caesar,49.0,1.2.220,CAESAR,And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
46562,46563,Julius Caesar,49.0,,CAESAR,"Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA"
46563,46564,Julius Caesar,50.0,1.2.221,CASCA,"You pull'd me by the cloak, would you speak with me?"
46564,46565,Julius Caesar,51.0,1.2.222,BRUTUS,"Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced to-day,"
46565,46566,Julius Caesar,51.0,1.2.223,BRUTUS,That Caesar looks so sad.
46566,46567,Julius Caesar,52.0,1.2.224,CASCA,"Why, you were with him, were you not?"
46567,46568,Julius Caesar,53.0,1.2.225,BRUTUS,I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
46568,46569,Julius Caesar,54.0,1.2.226,CASCA,"Why, there was a crown offered him: and being"
46569,46570,Julius Caesar,54.0,1.2.227,CASCA,"offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,"
46570,46571,Julius Caesar,54.0,1.2.228,CASCA,"thus, and then the people fell a-shouting."
46571,46572,Julius Caesar,55.0,1.2.229,BRUTUS,What was the second noise for?
46572,46573,Julius Caesar,56.0,1.2.230,CASCA,"Why, for that too."
46573,46574,Julius Caesar,57.0,1.2.231,CASSIUS,They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
46574,46575,Julius Caesar,58.0,1.2.232,CASCA,"Why, for that too."
46575,46576,Julius Caesar,59.0,1.2.233,BRUTUS,Was the crown offered him thrice?
46576,46577,Julius Caesar,60.0,1.2.234,CASCA,"Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every"
46577,46578,Julius Caesar,60.0,1.2.235,CASCA,"time gentler than other, and at every putting-by"
46578,46579,Julius Caesar,60.0,1.2.236,CASCA,mine honest neighbours shouted.
46579,46580,Julius Caesar,61.0,1.2.237,CASSIUS,Who offered him the crown?
46580,46581,Julius Caesar,62.0,1.2.238,CASCA,"Why, Antony."
46581,46582,Julius Caesar,63.0,1.2.239,BRUTUS,"Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca."
46582,46583,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.240,CASCA,I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
46583,46584,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.241,CASCA,"it was mere foolery, I did not mark it. I saw Mark"
46584,46585,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.242,CASCA,"Antony offer him a crown,--yet 'twas not a crown"
46585,46586,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.243,CASCA,"neither, 'twas one of these coronets,--and, as I told"
46586,46587,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.244,CASCA,"you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my"
46587,46588,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.245,CASCA,"thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he"
46588,46589,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.246,CASCA,"offered it to him again, then he put it by again:"
46589,46590,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.247,CASCA,"but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his"
46590,46591,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.248,CASCA,fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
46591,46592,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.249,CASCA,"time, he put it the third time by: and still as he"
46592,46593,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.250,CASCA,"refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their"
46593,46594,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.251,CASCA,chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
46594,46595,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.252,CASCA,and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
46595,46596,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.253,CASCA,Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
46596,46597,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.254,CASCA,"Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it: and"
46597,46598,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.255,CASCA,"for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of"
46598,46599,Julius Caesar,64.0,1.2.256,CASCA,opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
46599,46600,Julius Caesar,65.0,1.2.257,CASSIUS,"But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?"
46600,46601,Julius Caesar,66.0,1.2.258,CASCA,"He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at"
46601,46602,Julius Caesar,66.0,1.2.259,CASCA,"mouth, and was speechless."
46602,46603,Julius Caesar,67.0,1.2.260,BRUTUS,'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
46603,46604,Julius Caesar,68.0,1.2.261,CASSIUS,"No, Caesar hath it not, but you and I,"
46604,46605,Julius Caesar,68.0,1.2.262,CASSIUS,"And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness."
46605,46606,Julius Caesar,69.0,1.2.263,CASCA,"I know not what you mean by that, but, I am sure,"
46606,46607,Julius Caesar,69.0,1.2.264,CASCA,Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
46607,46608,Julius Caesar,69.0,1.2.265,CASCA,"clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and"
46608,46609,Julius Caesar,69.0,1.2.266,CASCA,"displeased them, as they use to do the players in"
46609,46610,Julius Caesar,69.0,1.2.267,CASCA,"the theatre, I am no true man."
46610,46611,Julius Caesar,70.0,1.2.268,BRUTUS,What said he when he came unto himself?
46611,46612,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.269,CASCA,"Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the"
46612,46613,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.270,CASCA,"common herd was glad he refused the crown, he"
46613,46614,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.271,CASCA,plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
46614,46615,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.272,CASCA,throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
46615,46616,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.273,CASCA,"occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,"
46616,46617,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.274,CASCA,I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
46617,46618,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.275,CASCA,"he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,"
46618,46619,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.276,CASCA,"If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired"
46619,46620,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.277,CASCA,their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
46620,46621,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.278,CASCA,"or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good"
46621,46622,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.279,CASCA,soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
46622,46623,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.280,CASCA,"there's no heed to be taken of them, if Caesar had"
46623,46624,Julius Caesar,71.0,1.2.281,CASCA,"stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less."
46624,46625,Julius Caesar,72.0,1.2.282,BRUTUS,"And after that, he came, thus sad, away?"
46625,46626,Julius Caesar,73.0,1.2.283,CASCA,Ay.
46626,46627,Julius Caesar,74.0,1.2.284,CASSIUS,Did Cicero say any thing?
46627,46628,Julius Caesar,75.0,1.2.285,CASCA,"Ay, he spoke Greek."
46628,46629,Julius Caesar,76.0,1.2.286,CASSIUS,To what effect?
46629,46630,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.287,CASCA,"Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the"
46630,46631,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.288,CASCA,face again: but those that understood him smiled at
46631,46632,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.289,CASCA,"one another and shook their heads, but, for mine own"
46632,46633,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.290,CASCA,"part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more"
46633,46634,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.291,CASCA,"news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs"
46634,46635,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.292,CASCA,"off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you"
46635,46636,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.293,CASCA,"well. There was more foolery yet, if I could"
46636,46637,Julius Caesar,77.0,1.2.294,CASCA,remember it.
46637,46638,Julius Caesar,78.0,1.2.295,CASSIUS,"Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?"
46638,46639,Julius Caesar,79.0,1.2.296,CASCA,"No, I am promised forth."
46639,46640,Julius Caesar,80.0,1.2.297,CASSIUS,Will you dine with me to-morrow?
46640,46641,Julius Caesar,81.0,1.2.298,CASCA,"Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner"
46641,46642,Julius Caesar,81.0,1.2.299,CASCA,worth the eating.
46642,46643,Julius Caesar,82.0,1.2.300,CASSIUS,Good: I will expect you.
46643,46644,Julius Caesar,83.0,1.2.301,CASCA,"Do so. Farewell, both."
46644,46645,Julius Caesar,83.0,,CASCA,Exit
46645,46646,Julius Caesar,84.0,1.2.302,BRUTUS,What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
46646,46647,Julius Caesar,84.0,1.2.303,BRUTUS,He was quick mettle when he went to school.
46647,46648,Julius Caesar,85.0,1.2.304,CASSIUS,So is he now in execution
46648,46649,Julius Caesar,85.0,1.2.305,CASSIUS,"Of any bold or noble enterprise,"
46649,46650,Julius Caesar,85.0,1.2.306,CASSIUS,However he puts on this tardy form.
46650,46651,Julius Caesar,85.0,1.2.307,CASSIUS,"This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,"
46651,46652,Julius Caesar,85.0,1.2.308,CASSIUS,Which gives men stomach to digest his words
46652,46653,Julius Caesar,85.0,1.2.309,CASSIUS,With better appetite.
46653,46654,Julius Caesar,86.0,1.2.310,BRUTUS,And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
46654,46655,Julius Caesar,86.0,1.2.311,BRUTUS,"To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,"
46655,46656,Julius Caesar,86.0,1.2.312,BRUTUS,"I will come home to you, or, if you will,"
46656,46657,Julius Caesar,86.0,1.2.313,BRUTUS,"Come home to me, and I will wait for you."
46657,46658,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.314,CASSIUS,"I will do so: till then, think of the world."
46658,46659,Julius Caesar,87.0,,CASSIUS,Exit BRUTUS
46659,46660,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.315,CASSIUS,"Well, Brutus, thou art noble, yet, I see,"
46660,46661,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.316,CASSIUS,Thy honourable metal may be wrought
46661,46662,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.317,CASSIUS,From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
46662,46663,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.318,CASSIUS,"That noble minds keep ever with their likes,"
46663,46664,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.319,CASSIUS,For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
46664,46665,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.320,CASSIUS,"Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus:"
46665,46666,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.321,CASSIUS,"If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,"
46666,46667,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.322,CASSIUS,"He should not humour me. I will this night,"
46667,46668,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.323,CASSIUS,"In several hands, in at his windows throw,"
46668,46669,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.324,CASSIUS,"As if they came from several citizens,"
46669,46670,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.325,CASSIUS,Writings all tending to the great opinion
46670,46671,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.326,CASSIUS,"That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely"
46671,46672,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.327,CASSIUS,Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
46672,46673,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.328,CASSIUS,"And after this let Caesar seat him sure,"
46673,46674,Julius Caesar,87.0,1.2.329,CASSIUS,"For we will shake him, or worse days endure."
46674,46675,Julius Caesar,87.0,,CASSIUS,Exit
46675,46676,Julius Caesar,87.0,,CASSIUS,SCENE III. The same. A street.
46676,46677,Julius Caesar,87.0,,CASSIUS,"Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO"
46677,46678,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.3.1,CICERO,"Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?"
46678,46679,Julius Caesar,1.0,1.3.2,CICERO,Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
46679,46680,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.3,CASCA,"Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth"
46680,46681,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.4,CASCA,"Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,"
46681,46682,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.5,CASCA,"I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds"
46682,46683,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.6,CASCA,"Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen"
46683,46684,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.7,CASCA,"The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,"
46684,46685,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.8,CASCA,To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
46685,46686,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.9,CASCA,"But never till to-night, never till now,"
46686,46687,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.10,CASCA,Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
46687,46688,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.11,CASCA,"Either there is a civil strife in heaven,"
46688,46689,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.12,CASCA,"Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,"
46689,46690,Julius Caesar,2.0,1.3.13,CASCA,Incenses them to send destruction.
46690,46691,Julius Caesar,3.0,1.3.14,CICERO,"Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?"
46691,46692,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.15,CASCA,A common slave--you know him well by sight--
46692,46693,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.16,CASCA,"Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn"
46693,46694,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.17,CASCA,"Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,"
46694,46695,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.18,CASCA,"Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd."
46695,46696,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.19,CASCA,Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
46696,46697,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.20,CASCA,"Against the Capitol I met a lion,"
46697,46698,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.21,CASCA,"Who glared upon me, and went surly by,"
46698,46699,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.22,CASCA,Without annoying me: and there were drawn
46699,46700,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.23,CASCA,"Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,"
46700,46701,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.24,CASCA,"Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw"
46701,46702,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.25,CASCA,Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
46702,46703,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.26,CASCA,And yesterday the bird of night did sit
46703,46704,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.27,CASCA,"Even at noon-day upon the market-place,"
46704,46705,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.28,CASCA,Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
46705,46706,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.29,CASCA,"Do so conjointly meet, let not men say"
46706,46707,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.30,CASCA,"'These are their reasons, they are natural,'"
46707,46708,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.31,CASCA,"For, I believe, they are portentous things"
46708,46709,Julius Caesar,4.0,1.3.32,CASCA,Unto the climate that they point upon.
46709,46710,Julius Caesar,5.0,1.3.33,CICERO,"Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:"
46710,46711,Julius Caesar,5.0,1.3.34,CICERO,"But men may construe things after their fashion,"
46711,46712,Julius Caesar,5.0,1.3.35,CICERO,Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
46712,46713,Julius Caesar,5.0,1.3.36,CICERO,Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
46713,46714,Julius Caesar,6.0,1.3.37,CASCA,"He doth, for he did bid Antonius"
46714,46715,Julius Caesar,6.0,1.3.38,CASCA,Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
46715,46716,Julius Caesar,7.0,1.3.39,CICERO,"Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky"
46716,46717,Julius Caesar,7.0,1.3.40,CICERO,Is not to walk in.
46717,46718,Julius Caesar,8.0,1.3.41,CASCA,"Farewell, Cicero."
46718,46719,Julius Caesar,8.0,,CASCA,Exit CICERO
46719,46720,Julius Caesar,8.0,,CASCA,Enter CASSIUS
46720,46721,Julius Caesar,9.0,1.3.42,CASSIUS,Who's there?
46721,46722,Julius Caesar,10.0,1.3.43,CASCA,A Roman.
46722,46723,Julius Caesar,11.0,1.3.44,CASSIUS,"Casca, by your voice."
46723,46724,Julius Caesar,12.0,1.3.45,CASCA,"Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!"
46724,46725,Julius Caesar,13.0,1.3.46,CASSIUS,A very pleasing night to honest men.
46725,46726,Julius Caesar,14.0,1.3.47,CASCA,Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
46726,46727,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.48,CASSIUS,Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
46727,46728,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.49,CASSIUS,"For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,"
46728,46729,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.50,CASSIUS,"Submitting me unto the perilous night,"
46729,46730,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.51,CASSIUS,"And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,"
46730,46731,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.52,CASSIUS,"Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone,"
46731,46732,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.53,CASSIUS,And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
46732,46733,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.54,CASSIUS,"The breast of heaven, I did present myself"
46733,46734,Julius Caesar,15.0,1.3.55,CASSIUS,Even in the aim and very flash of it.
46734,46735,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.3.56,CASCA,But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
46735,46736,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.3.57,CASCA,"It is the part of men to fear and tremble,"
46736,46737,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.3.58,CASCA,When the most mighty gods by tokens send
46737,46738,Julius Caesar,16.0,1.3.59,CASCA,Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
46738,46739,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.60,CASSIUS,"You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life"
46739,46740,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.61,CASSIUS,"That should be in a Roman you do want,"
46740,46741,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.62,CASSIUS,Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
46741,46742,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.63,CASSIUS,"And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,"
46742,46743,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.64,CASSIUS,To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
46743,46744,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.65,CASSIUS,But if you would consider the true cause
46744,46745,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.66,CASSIUS,"Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,"
46745,46746,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.67,CASSIUS,"Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,"
46746,46747,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.68,CASSIUS,"Why old men fool and children calculate,"
46747,46748,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.69,CASSIUS,Why all these things change from their ordinance
46748,46749,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.70,CASSIUS,Their natures and preformed faculties
46749,46750,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.71,CASSIUS,"To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find"
46750,46751,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.72,CASSIUS,"That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,"
46751,46752,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.73,CASSIUS,To make them instruments of fear and warning
46752,46753,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.74,CASSIUS,Unto some monstrous state.
46753,46754,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.75,CASSIUS,"Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man"
46754,46755,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.76,CASSIUS,"Most like this dreadful night,"
46755,46756,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.77,CASSIUS,"That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars"
46756,46757,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.78,CASSIUS,"As doth the lion in the Capitol,"
46757,46758,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.79,CASSIUS,A man no mightier than thyself or me
46758,46759,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.80,CASSIUS,"In personal action, yet prodigious grown"
46759,46760,Julius Caesar,17.0,1.3.81,CASSIUS,"And fearful, as these strange eruptions are."
46760,46761,Julius Caesar,18.0,1.3.82,CASCA,"'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?"
46761,46762,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.3.83,CASSIUS,Let it be who it is: for Romans now
46762,46763,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.3.84,CASSIUS,"Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors,"
46763,46764,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.3.85,CASSIUS,"But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,"
46764,46765,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.3.86,CASSIUS,"And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits,"
46765,46766,Julius Caesar,19.0,1.3.87,CASSIUS,Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
46766,46767,Julius Caesar,20.0,1.3.88,CASCA,"Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow"
46767,46768,Julius Caesar,20.0,1.3.89,CASCA,"Mean to establish Caesar as a king,"
46768,46769,Julius Caesar,20.0,1.3.90,CASCA,"And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,"
46769,46770,Julius Caesar,20.0,1.3.91,CASCA,"In every place, save here in Italy."
46770,46771,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.92,CASSIUS,"I know where I will wear this dagger then,"
46771,46772,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.93,CASSIUS,Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
46772,46773,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.94,CASSIUS,"Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong,"
46773,46774,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.95,CASSIUS,"Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:"
46774,46775,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.96,CASSIUS,"Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,"
46775,46776,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.97,CASSIUS,"Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,"
46776,46777,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.98,CASSIUS,"Can be retentive to the strength of spirit,"
46777,46778,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.99,CASSIUS,"But life, being weary of these worldly bars,"
46778,46779,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.100,CASSIUS,Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
46779,46780,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.101,CASSIUS,"If I know this, know all the world besides,"
46780,46781,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.102,CASSIUS,That part of tyranny that I do bear
46781,46782,Julius Caesar,21.0,1.3.103,CASSIUS,I can shake off at pleasure.
46782,46783,Julius Caesar,21.0,,CASSIUS,Thunder still
46783,46784,Julius Caesar,22.0,1.3.104,CASCA,So can I:
46784,46785,Julius Caesar,22.0,1.3.105,CASCA,So every bondman in his own hand bears
46785,46786,Julius Caesar,22.0,1.3.106,CASCA,The power to cancel his captivity.
46786,46787,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.107,CASSIUS,And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
46787,46788,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.108,CASSIUS,"Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,"
46788,46789,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.109,CASSIUS,But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
46789,46790,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.110,CASSIUS,"He were no lion, were not Romans hinds."
46790,46791,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.111,CASSIUS,Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
46791,46792,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.112,CASSIUS,"Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,"
46792,46793,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.113,CASSIUS,"What rubbish and what offal, when it serves"
46793,46794,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.114,CASSIUS,For the base matter to illuminate
46794,46795,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.115,CASSIUS,"So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,"
46795,46796,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.116,CASSIUS,Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
46796,46797,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.117,CASSIUS,"Before a willing bondman, then I know"
46797,46798,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.118,CASSIUS,"My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,"
46798,46799,Julius Caesar,23.0,1.3.119,CASSIUS,And dangers are to me indifferent.
46799,46800,Julius Caesar,24.0,1.3.120,CASCA,"You speak to Casca, and to such a man"
46800,46801,Julius Caesar,24.0,1.3.121,CASCA,"That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:"
46801,46802,Julius Caesar,24.0,1.3.122,CASCA,"Be factious for redress of all these griefs,"
46802,46803,Julius Caesar,24.0,1.3.123,CASCA,And I will set this foot of mine as far
46803,46804,Julius Caesar,24.0,1.3.124,CASCA,As who goes farthest.
46804,46805,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.125,CASSIUS,There's a bargain made.
46805,46806,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.126,CASSIUS,"Now know you, Casca, I have moved already"
46806,46807,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.127,CASSIUS,Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
46807,46808,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.128,CASSIUS,To undergo with me an enterprise
46808,46809,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.129,CASSIUS,"Of honourable-dangerous consequence,"
46809,46810,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.130,CASSIUS,"And I do know, by this, they stay for me"
46810,46811,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.131,CASSIUS,"In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,"
46811,46812,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.132,CASSIUS,"There is no stir or walking in the streets,"
46812,46813,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.133,CASSIUS,And the complexion of the element
46813,46814,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.134,CASSIUS,"In favour's like the work we have in hand,"
46814,46815,Julius Caesar,25.0,1.3.135,CASSIUS,"Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible."
46815,46816,Julius Caesar,26.0,1.3.136,CASCA,"Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste."
46816,46817,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.3.137,CASSIUS,"'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait,"
46817,46818,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.3.138,CASSIUS,He is a friend.
46818,46819,Julius Caesar,27.0,,CASSIUS,Enter CINNA
46819,46820,Julius Caesar,27.0,1.3.139,CASSIUS,"Cinna, where haste you so?"
46820,46821,Julius Caesar,28.0,1.3.140,CINNA,To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
46821,46822,Julius Caesar,29.0,1.3.141,CASSIUS,"No, it is Casca, one incorporate"
46822,46823,Julius Caesar,29.0,1.3.142,CASSIUS,"To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?"
46823,46824,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.3.143,CINNA,I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
46824,46825,Julius Caesar,30.0,1.3.144,CINNA,There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
46825,46826,Julius Caesar,31.0,1.3.145,CASSIUS,Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
46826,46827,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.3.146,CINNA,"Yes, you are."
46827,46828,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.3.147,CINNA,"O Cassius, if you could"
46828,46829,Julius Caesar,32.0,1.3.148,CINNA,But win the noble Brutus to our party--
46829,46830,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.3.149,CASSIUS,"Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,"
46830,46831,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.3.150,CASSIUS,"And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,"
46831,46832,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.3.151,CASSIUS,"Where Brutus may but find it, and throw this"
46832,46833,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.3.152,CASSIUS,"In at his window, set this up with wax"
46833,46834,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.3.153,CASSIUS,"Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,"
46834,46835,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.3.154,CASSIUS,"Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us."
46835,46836,Julius Caesar,33.0,1.3.155,CASSIUS,Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
46836,46837,Julius Caesar,34.0,1.3.156,CINNA,"All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone"
46837,46838,Julius Caesar,34.0,1.3.157,CINNA,"To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,"
46838,46839,Julius Caesar,34.0,1.3.158,CINNA,And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
46839,46840,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.3.159,CASSIUS,"That done, repair to Pompey's theatre."
46840,46841,Julius Caesar,35.0,,CASSIUS,Exit CINNA
46841,46842,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.3.160,CASSIUS,"Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day"
46842,46843,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.3.161,CASSIUS,See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
46843,46844,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.3.162,CASSIUS,"Is ours already, and the man entire"
46844,46845,Julius Caesar,35.0,1.3.163,CASSIUS,Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
46845,46846,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.3.164,CASCA,"O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:"
46846,46847,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.3.165,CASCA,"And that which would appear offence in us,"
46847,46848,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.3.166,CASCA,"His countenance, like richest alchemy,"
46848,46849,Julius Caesar,36.0,1.3.167,CASCA,Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
46849,46850,Julius Caesar,37.0,1.3.168,CASSIUS,Him and his worth and our great need of him
46850,46851,Julius Caesar,37.0,1.3.169,CASSIUS,"You have right well conceited. Let us go,"
46851,46852,Julius Caesar,37.0,1.3.170,CASSIUS,"For it is after midnight, and ere day"
46852,46853,Julius Caesar,37.0,1.3.171,CASSIUS,We will awake him and be sure of him.
46853,46854,Julius Caesar,37.0,,CASSIUS,Exeunt
46854,46855,Julius Caesar,37.0,,CASSIUS,ACT II
46855,46856,Julius Caesar,37.0,,CASSIUS,SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.
46856,46857,Julius Caesar,37.0,,CASSIUS,Enter BRUTUS
46857,46858,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.1.1,BRUTUS,"What, Lucius, ho!"
46858,46859,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.1.2,BRUTUS,"I cannot, by the progress of the stars,"
46859,46860,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.1.3,BRUTUS,"Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!"
46860,46861,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.1.4,BRUTUS,I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
46861,46862,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.1.5,BRUTUS,"When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!"
46862,46863,Julius Caesar,1.0,,BRUTUS,Enter LUCIUS
46863,46864,Julius Caesar,2.0,2.1.6,LUCIUS,"Call'd you, my lord?"
46864,46865,Julius Caesar,3.0,2.1.7,BRUTUS,"Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:"
46865,46866,Julius Caesar,3.0,2.1.8,BRUTUS,"When it is lighted, come and call me here."
46866,46867,Julius Caesar,4.0,2.1.9,LUCIUS,"I will, my lord."
46867,46868,Julius Caesar,4.0,,LUCIUS,Exit
46868,46869,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.10,BRUTUS,"It must be by his death: and for my part,"
46869,46870,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.11,BRUTUS,"I know no personal cause to spurn at him,"
46870,46871,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.12,BRUTUS,But for the general. He would be crown'd:
46871,46872,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.13,BRUTUS,"How that might change his nature, there's the question."
46872,46873,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.14,BRUTUS,"It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,"
46873,46874,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.15,BRUTUS,"And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that,--"
46874,46875,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.16,BRUTUS,"And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,"
46875,46876,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.17,BRUTUS,That at his will he may do danger with.
46876,46877,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.18,BRUTUS,"The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins"
46877,46878,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.19,BRUTUS,"Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,"
46878,46879,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.20,BRUTUS,I have not known when his affections sway'd
46879,46880,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.21,BRUTUS,"More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,"
46880,46881,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.22,BRUTUS,"That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,"
46881,46882,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.23,BRUTUS,"Whereto the climber-upward turns his face,"
46882,46883,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.24,BRUTUS,But when he once attains the upmost round.
46883,46884,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.25,BRUTUS,"He then unto the ladder turns his back,"
46884,46885,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.26,BRUTUS,"Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees"
46885,46886,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.27,BRUTUS,By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
46886,46887,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.28,BRUTUS,"Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel"
46887,46888,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.29,BRUTUS,"Will bear no colour for the thing he is,"
46888,46889,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.30,BRUTUS,"Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,"
46889,46890,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.31,BRUTUS,Would run to these and these extremities:
46890,46891,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.32,BRUTUS,And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
46891,46892,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.33,BRUTUS,"Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,"
46892,46893,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.1.34,BRUTUS,And kill him in the shell.
46893,46894,Julius Caesar,5.0,,BRUTUS,Re-enter LUCIUS
46894,46895,Julius Caesar,6.0,2.1.35,LUCIUS,"The taper burneth in your closet, sir."
46895,46896,Julius Caesar,6.0,2.1.36,LUCIUS,"Searching the window for a flint, I found"
46896,46897,Julius Caesar,6.0,2.1.37,LUCIUS,"This paper, thus seal'd up, and, I am sure,"
46897,46898,Julius Caesar,6.0,2.1.38,LUCIUS,It did not lie there when I went to bed.
46898,46899,Julius Caesar,6.0,,LUCIUS,Gives him the letter
46899,46900,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.1.39,BRUTUS,"Get you to bed again, it is not day."
46900,46901,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.1.40,BRUTUS,"Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?"
46901,46902,Julius Caesar,8.0,2.1.41,LUCIUS,"I know not, sir."
46902,46903,Julius Caesar,9.0,2.1.42,BRUTUS,"Look in the calendar, and bring me word."
46903,46904,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.1.43,LUCIUS,"I will, sir."
46904,46905,Julius Caesar,10.0,,LUCIUS,Exit
46905,46906,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.44,BRUTUS,The exhalations whizzing in the air
46906,46907,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.45,BRUTUS,Give so much light that I may read by them.
46907,46908,Julius Caesar,11.0,,BRUTUS,Opens the letter and reads
46908,46909,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.46,BRUTUS,"'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself."
46909,46910,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.47,BRUTUS,"Shall Rome,  and c. Speak, strike, redress!"
46910,46911,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.48,BRUTUS,"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'"
46911,46912,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.49,BRUTUS,Such instigations have been often dropp'd
46912,46913,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.50,BRUTUS,Where I have took them up.
46913,46914,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.51,BRUTUS,"'Shall Rome,  and c.' Thus must I piece it out:"
46914,46915,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.52,BRUTUS,"Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?"
46915,46916,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.53,BRUTUS,My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
46916,46917,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.54,BRUTUS,"The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king."
46917,46918,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.55,BRUTUS,"'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated"
46918,46919,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.56,BRUTUS,"To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:"
46919,46920,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.57,BRUTUS,"If the redress will follow, thou receivest"
46920,46921,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.1.58,BRUTUS,Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
46921,46922,Julius Caesar,11.0,,BRUTUS,Re-enter LUCIUS
46922,46923,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.1.59,LUCIUS,"Sir, March is wasted fourteen days."
46923,46924,Julius Caesar,12.0,,LUCIUS,Knocking within
46924,46925,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.60,BRUTUS,"'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks."
46925,46926,Julius Caesar,13.0,,BRUTUS,Exit LUCIUS
46926,46927,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.61,BRUTUS,"Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,"
46927,46928,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.62,BRUTUS,I have not slept.
46928,46929,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.63,BRUTUS,Between the acting of a dreadful thing
46929,46930,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.64,BRUTUS,"And the first motion, all the interim is"
46930,46931,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.65,BRUTUS,"Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:"
46931,46932,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.66,BRUTUS,The Genius and the mortal instruments
46932,46933,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.67,BRUTUS,"Are then in council, and the state of man,"
46933,46934,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.68,BRUTUS,"Like to a little kingdom, suffers then"
46934,46935,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.1.69,BRUTUS,The nature of an insurrection.
46935,46936,Julius Caesar,13.0,,BRUTUS,Re-enter LUCIUS
46936,46937,Julius Caesar,14.0,2.1.70,LUCIUS,"Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,"
46937,46938,Julius Caesar,14.0,2.1.71,LUCIUS,Who doth desire to see you.
46938,46939,Julius Caesar,15.0,2.1.72,BRUTUS,Is he alone?
46939,46940,Julius Caesar,16.0,2.1.73,LUCIUS,"No, sir, there are moe with him."
46940,46941,Julius Caesar,17.0,2.1.74,BRUTUS,Do you know them?
46941,46942,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.1.75,LUCIUS,"No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,"
46942,46943,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.1.76,LUCIUS,"And half their faces buried in their cloaks,"
46943,46944,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.1.77,LUCIUS,That by no means I may discover them
46944,46945,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.1.78,LUCIUS,By any mark of favour.
46945,46946,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.79,BRUTUS,Let 'em enter.
46946,46947,Julius Caesar,19.0,,BRUTUS,Exit LUCIUS
46947,46948,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.80,BRUTUS,"They are the faction. O conspiracy,"
46948,46949,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.81,BRUTUS,"Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,"
46949,46950,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.82,BRUTUS,"When evils are most free? O, then by day"
46950,46951,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.83,BRUTUS,Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
46951,46952,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.84,BRUTUS,"To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy,"
46952,46953,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.85,BRUTUS,Hide it in smiles and affability:
46953,46954,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.86,BRUTUS,"For if thou path, thy native semblance on,"
46954,46955,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.87,BRUTUS,Not Erebus itself were dim enough
46955,46956,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.1.88,BRUTUS,To hide thee from prevention.
46956,46957,Julius Caesar,19.0,,BRUTUS,"Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS"
46957,46958,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.1.89,CASSIUS,I think we are too bold upon your rest:
46958,46959,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.1.90,CASSIUS,"Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?"
46959,46960,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.1.91,BRUTUS,"I have been up this hour, awake all night."
46960,46961,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.1.92,BRUTUS,Know I these men that come along with you?
46961,46962,Julius Caesar,22.0,2.1.93,CASSIUS,"Yes, every man of them, and no man here"
46962,46963,Julius Caesar,22.0,2.1.94,CASSIUS,"But honours you, and every one doth wish"
46963,46964,Julius Caesar,22.0,2.1.95,CASSIUS,You had but that opinion of yourself
46964,46965,Julius Caesar,22.0,2.1.96,CASSIUS,Which every noble Roman bears of you.
46965,46966,Julius Caesar,22.0,2.1.97,CASSIUS,This is Trebonius.
46966,46967,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.1.98,BRUTUS,He is welcome hither.
46967,46968,Julius Caesar,24.0,2.1.99,CASSIUS,"This, Decius Brutus."
46968,46969,Julius Caesar,25.0,2.1.100,BRUTUS,He is welcome too.
46969,46970,Julius Caesar,26.0,2.1.101,CASSIUS,"This, Casca, this, Cinna, and this, Metellus Cimber."
46970,46971,Julius Caesar,27.0,2.1.102,BRUTUS,They are all welcome.
46971,46972,Julius Caesar,27.0,2.1.103,BRUTUS,What watchful cares do interpose themselves
46972,46973,Julius Caesar,27.0,2.1.104,BRUTUS,Betwixt your eyes and night?
46973,46974,Julius Caesar,28.0,2.1.105,CASSIUS,Shall I entreat a word?
46974,46975,Julius Caesar,28.0,,CASSIUS,BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper
46975,46976,Julius Caesar,29.0,2.1.106,DECIUS BRUTUS,Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
46976,46977,Julius Caesar,30.0,2.1.107,CASCA,No.
46977,46978,Julius Caesar,31.0,2.1.108,CINNA,"O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon gray lines"
46978,46979,Julius Caesar,31.0,2.1.109,CINNA,That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
46979,46980,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.1.110,CASCA,You shall confess that you are both deceived.
46980,46981,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.1.111,CASCA,"Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,"
46981,46982,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.1.112,CASCA,"Which is a great way growing on the south,"
46982,46983,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.1.113,CASCA,Weighing the youthful season of the year.
46983,46984,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.1.114,CASCA,Some two months hence up higher toward the north
46984,46985,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.1.115,CASCA,"He first presents his fire, and the high east"
46985,46986,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.1.116,CASCA,"Stands, as the Capitol, directly here."
46986,46987,Julius Caesar,33.0,2.1.117,BRUTUS,"Give me your hands all over, one by one."
46987,46988,Julius Caesar,34.0,2.1.118,CASSIUS,And let us swear our resolution.
46988,46989,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.119,BRUTUS,"No, not an oath: if not the face of men,"
46989,46990,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.120,BRUTUS,"The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--"
46990,46991,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.121,BRUTUS,"If these be motives weak, break off betimes,"
46991,46992,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.122,BRUTUS,"And every man hence to his idle bed,"
46992,46993,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.123,BRUTUS,"So let high-sighted tyranny range on,"
46993,46994,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.124,BRUTUS,"Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,"
46994,46995,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.125,BRUTUS,"As I am sure they do, bear fire enough"
46995,46996,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.126,BRUTUS,To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
46996,46997,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.127,BRUTUS,"The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,"
46997,46998,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.128,BRUTUS,"What need we any spur but our own cause,"
46998,46999,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.129,BRUTUS,To prick us to redress? what other bond
46999,47000,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.130,BRUTUS,"Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,"
47000,47001,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.131,BRUTUS,And will not palter? and what other oath
47001,47002,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.132,BRUTUS,"Than honesty to honesty engaged,"
47002,47003,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.133,BRUTUS,"That this shall be, or we will fall for it?"
47003,47004,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.134,BRUTUS,"Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,"
47004,47005,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.135,BRUTUS,Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
47005,47006,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.136,BRUTUS,"That welcome wrongs, unto bad causes swear"
47006,47007,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.137,BRUTUS,"Such creatures as men doubt, but do not stain"
47007,47008,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.138,BRUTUS,"The even virtue of our enterprise,"
47008,47009,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.139,BRUTUS,"Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,"
47009,47010,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.140,BRUTUS,To think that or our cause or our performance
47010,47011,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.141,BRUTUS,"Did need an oath, when every drop of blood"
47011,47012,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.142,BRUTUS,"That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,"
47012,47013,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.143,BRUTUS,"Is guilty of a several bastardy,"
47013,47014,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.144,BRUTUS,If he do break the smallest particle
47014,47015,Julius Caesar,35.0,2.1.145,BRUTUS,Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
47015,47016,Julius Caesar,36.0,2.1.146,CASSIUS,But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
47016,47017,Julius Caesar,36.0,2.1.147,CASSIUS,I think he will stand very strong with us.
47017,47018,Julius Caesar,37.0,2.1.148,CASCA,Let us not leave him out.
47018,47019,Julius Caesar,38.0,2.1.149,CINNA,"No, by no means."
47019,47020,Julius Caesar,39.0,2.1.150,METELLUS CIMBER,"O, let us have him, for his silver hairs"
47020,47021,Julius Caesar,39.0,2.1.151,METELLUS CIMBER,Will purchase us a good opinion
47021,47022,Julius Caesar,39.0,2.1.152,METELLUS CIMBER,And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
47022,47023,Julius Caesar,39.0,2.1.153,METELLUS CIMBER,"It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands,"
47023,47024,Julius Caesar,39.0,2.1.154,METELLUS CIMBER,"Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,"
47024,47025,Julius Caesar,39.0,2.1.155,METELLUS CIMBER,But all be buried in his gravity.
47025,47026,Julius Caesar,40.0,2.1.156,BRUTUS,"O, name him not: let us not break with him,"
47026,47027,Julius Caesar,40.0,2.1.157,BRUTUS,For he will never follow any thing
47027,47028,Julius Caesar,40.0,2.1.158,BRUTUS,That other men begin.
47028,47029,Julius Caesar,41.0,2.1.159,CASSIUS,Then leave him out.
47029,47030,Julius Caesar,42.0,2.1.160,CASCA,Indeed he is not fit.
47030,47031,Julius Caesar,43.0,2.1.161,DECIUS BRUTUS,Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
47031,47032,Julius Caesar,44.0,2.1.162,CASSIUS,"Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,"
47032,47033,Julius Caesar,44.0,2.1.163,CASSIUS,"Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,"
47033,47034,Julius Caesar,44.0,2.1.164,CASSIUS,Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
47034,47035,Julius Caesar,44.0,2.1.165,CASSIUS,"A shrewd contriver, and, you know, his means,"
47035,47036,Julius Caesar,44.0,2.1.166,CASSIUS,"If he improve them, may well stretch so far"
47036,47037,Julius Caesar,44.0,2.1.167,CASSIUS,"As to annoy us all: which to prevent,"
47037,47038,Julius Caesar,44.0,2.1.168,CASSIUS,Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
47038,47039,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.169,BRUTUS,"Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,"
47039,47040,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.170,BRUTUS,"To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,"
47040,47041,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.171,BRUTUS,"Like wrath in death and envy afterwards,"
47041,47042,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.172,BRUTUS,For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
47042,47043,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.173,BRUTUS,"Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius."
47043,47044,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.174,BRUTUS,"We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,"
47044,47045,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.175,BRUTUS,And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
47045,47046,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.176,BRUTUS,"O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,"
47046,47047,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.177,BRUTUS,"And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,"
47047,47048,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.178,BRUTUS,"Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,"
47048,47049,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.179,BRUTUS,"Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully,"
47049,47050,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.180,BRUTUS,"Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,"
47050,47051,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.181,BRUTUS,Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
47051,47052,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.182,BRUTUS,"And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,"
47052,47053,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.183,BRUTUS,"Stir up their servants to an act of rage,"
47053,47054,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.184,BRUTUS,And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
47054,47055,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.185,BRUTUS,Our purpose necessary and not envious:
47055,47056,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.186,BRUTUS,"Which so appearing to the common eyes,"
47056,47057,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.187,BRUTUS,"We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers."
47057,47058,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.188,BRUTUS,"And for Mark Antony, think not of him,"
47058,47059,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.189,BRUTUS,For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
47059,47060,Julius Caesar,45.0,2.1.190,BRUTUS,When Caesar's head is off.
47060,47061,Julius Caesar,46.0,2.1.191,CASSIUS,"Yet I fear him,"
47061,47062,Julius Caesar,46.0,2.1.192,CASSIUS,For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
47062,47063,Julius Caesar,47.0,2.1.193,BRUTUS,"Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:"
47063,47064,Julius Caesar,47.0,2.1.194,BRUTUS,"If he love Caesar, all that he can do"
47064,47065,Julius Caesar,47.0,2.1.195,BRUTUS,"Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:"
47065,47066,Julius Caesar,47.0,2.1.196,BRUTUS,"And that were much he should, for he is given"
47066,47067,Julius Caesar,47.0,2.1.197,BRUTUS,"To sports, to wildness and much company."
47067,47068,Julius Caesar,48.0,2.1.198,TREBONIUS,"There is no fear in him, let him not die,"
47068,47069,Julius Caesar,48.0,2.1.199,TREBONIUS,"For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter."
47069,47070,Julius Caesar,48.0,,TREBONIUS,Clock strikes
47070,47071,Julius Caesar,49.0,2.1.200,BRUTUS,Peace! count the clock.
47071,47072,Julius Caesar,50.0,2.1.201,CASSIUS,The clock hath stricken three.
47072,47073,Julius Caesar,51.0,2.1.202,TREBONIUS,'Tis time to part.
47073,47074,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.203,CASSIUS,"But it is doubtful yet,"
47074,47075,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.204,CASSIUS,"Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no,"
47075,47076,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.205,CASSIUS,"For he is superstitious grown of late,"
47076,47077,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.206,CASSIUS,Quite from the main opinion he held once
47077,47078,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.207,CASSIUS,"Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:"
47078,47079,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.208,CASSIUS,"It may be, these apparent prodigies,"
47079,47080,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.209,CASSIUS,"The unaccustom'd terror of this night,"
47080,47081,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.210,CASSIUS,"And the persuasion of his augurers,"
47081,47082,Julius Caesar,52.0,2.1.211,CASSIUS,May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
47082,47083,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.212,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Never fear that: if he be so resolved,"
47083,47084,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.213,DECIUS BRUTUS,"I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear"
47084,47085,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.214,DECIUS BRUTUS,"That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,"
47085,47086,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.215,DECIUS BRUTUS,"And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,"
47086,47087,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.216,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Lions with toils and men with flatterers,"
47087,47088,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.217,DECIUS BRUTUS,"But when I tell him he hates flatterers,"
47088,47089,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.218,DECIUS BRUTUS,"He says he does, being then most flattered."
47089,47090,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.219,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Let me work,"
47090,47091,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.220,DECIUS BRUTUS,"For I can give his humour the true bent,"
47091,47092,Julius Caesar,53.0,2.1.221,DECIUS BRUTUS,And I will bring him to the Capitol.
47092,47093,Julius Caesar,54.0,2.1.222,CASSIUS,"Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him."
47093,47094,Julius Caesar,55.0,2.1.223,BRUTUS,By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
47094,47095,Julius Caesar,56.0,2.1.224,CINNA,"Be that the uttermost, and fail not then."
47095,47096,Julius Caesar,57.0,2.1.225,METELLUS CIMBER,"Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,"
47096,47097,Julius Caesar,57.0,2.1.226,METELLUS CIMBER,Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
47097,47098,Julius Caesar,57.0,2.1.227,METELLUS CIMBER,I wonder none of you have thought of him.
47098,47099,Julius Caesar,58.0,2.1.228,BRUTUS,"Now, good Metellus, go along by him:"
47099,47100,Julius Caesar,58.0,2.1.229,BRUTUS,"He loves me well, and I have given him reasons,"
47100,47101,Julius Caesar,58.0,2.1.230,BRUTUS,"Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him."
47101,47102,Julius Caesar,59.0,2.1.231,CASSIUS,"The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus."
47102,47103,Julius Caesar,59.0,2.1.232,CASSIUS,"And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember"
47103,47104,Julius Caesar,59.0,2.1.233,CASSIUS,"What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans."
47104,47105,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.234,BRUTUS,"Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily,"
47105,47106,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.235,BRUTUS,"Let not our looks put on our purposes,"
47106,47107,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.236,BRUTUS,"But bear it as our Roman actors do,"
47107,47108,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.237,BRUTUS,With untired spirits and formal constancy:
47108,47109,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.238,BRUTUS,And so good morrow to you every one.
47109,47110,Julius Caesar,60.0,,BRUTUS,Exeunt all but BRUTUS
47110,47111,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.239,BRUTUS,"Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter,"
47111,47112,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.240,BRUTUS,Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
47112,47113,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.241,BRUTUS,"Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,"
47113,47114,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.242,BRUTUS,"Which busy care draws in the brains of men,"
47114,47115,Julius Caesar,60.0,2.1.243,BRUTUS,Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
47115,47116,Julius Caesar,60.0,,BRUTUS,Enter PORTIA
47116,47117,Julius Caesar,61.0,2.1.244,PORTIA,"Brutus, my lord!"
47117,47118,Julius Caesar,62.0,2.1.245,BRUTUS,"Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?"
47118,47119,Julius Caesar,62.0,2.1.246,BRUTUS,It is not for your health thus to commit
47119,47120,Julius Caesar,62.0,2.1.247,BRUTUS,Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
47120,47121,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.248,PORTIA,"Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,"
47121,47122,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.249,PORTIA,"Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,"
47122,47123,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.250,PORTIA,"You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,"
47123,47124,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.251,PORTIA,"Musing and sighing, with your arms across,"
47124,47125,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.252,PORTIA,"And when I ask'd you what the matter was,"
47125,47126,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.253,PORTIA,"You stared upon me with ungentle looks,"
47126,47127,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.254,PORTIA,"I urged you further, then you scratch'd your head,"
47127,47128,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.255,PORTIA,"And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot,"
47128,47129,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.256,PORTIA,"Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,"
47129,47130,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.257,PORTIA,"But, with an angry wafture of your hand,"
47130,47131,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.258,PORTIA,"Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did,"
47131,47132,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.259,PORTIA,Fearing to strengthen that impatience
47132,47133,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.260,PORTIA,"Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal"
47133,47134,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.261,PORTIA,"Hoping it was but an effect of humour,"
47134,47135,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.262,PORTIA,Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
47135,47136,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.263,PORTIA,"It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,"
47136,47137,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.264,PORTIA,And could it work so much upon your shape
47137,47138,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.265,PORTIA,"As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,"
47138,47139,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.266,PORTIA,"I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,"
47139,47140,Julius Caesar,63.0,2.1.267,PORTIA,Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
47140,47141,Julius Caesar,64.0,2.1.268,BRUTUS,"I am not well in health, and that is all."
47141,47142,Julius Caesar,65.0,2.1.269,PORTIA,"Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,"
47142,47143,Julius Caesar,65.0,2.1.270,PORTIA,He would embrace the means to come by it.
47143,47144,Julius Caesar,66.0,2.1.271,BRUTUS,"Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed."
47144,47145,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.272,PORTIA,Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
47145,47146,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.273,PORTIA,To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
47146,47147,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.274,PORTIA,"Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,"
47147,47148,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.275,PORTIA,"And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,"
47148,47149,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.276,PORTIA,To dare the vile contagion of the night
47149,47150,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.277,PORTIA,And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
47150,47151,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.278,PORTIA,"To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,"
47151,47152,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.279,PORTIA,"You have some sick offence within your mind,"
47152,47153,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.280,PORTIA,"Which, by the right and virtue of my place,"
47153,47154,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.281,PORTIA,"I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,"
47154,47155,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.282,PORTIA,"I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,"
47155,47156,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.283,PORTIA,By all your vows of love and that great vow
47156,47157,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.284,PORTIA,"Which did incorporate and make us one,"
47157,47158,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.285,PORTIA,"That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,"
47158,47159,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.286,PORTIA,"Why you are heavy, and what men to-night"
47159,47160,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.287,PORTIA,Have had to resort to you: for here have been
47160,47161,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.288,PORTIA,"Some six or seven, who did hide their faces"
47161,47162,Julius Caesar,67.0,2.1.289,PORTIA,Even from darkness.
47162,47163,Julius Caesar,68.0,2.1.290,BRUTUS,"Kneel not, gentle Portia."
47163,47164,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.291,PORTIA,"I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus."
47164,47165,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.292,PORTIA,"Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,"
47165,47166,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.293,PORTIA,Is it excepted I should know no secrets
47166,47167,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.294,PORTIA,That appertain to you? Am I yourself
47167,47168,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.295,PORTIA,"But, as it were, in sort or limitation,"
47168,47169,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.296,PORTIA,"To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,"
47169,47170,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.297,PORTIA,And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
47170,47171,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.298,PORTIA,"Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,"
47171,47172,Julius Caesar,69.0,2.1.299,PORTIA,"Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife."
47172,47173,Julius Caesar,70.0,2.1.300,BRUTUS,"You are my true and honourable wife,"
47173,47174,Julius Caesar,70.0,2.1.301,BRUTUS,As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
47174,47175,Julius Caesar,70.0,2.1.302,BRUTUS,That visit my sad heart
47175,47176,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.303,PORTIA,"If this were true, then should I know this secret."
47176,47177,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.304,PORTIA,"I grant I am a woman, but withal"
47177,47178,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.305,PORTIA,A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
47178,47179,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.306,PORTIA,"I grant I am a woman, but withal"
47179,47180,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.307,PORTIA,"A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter."
47180,47181,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.308,PORTIA,"Think you I am no stronger than my sex,"
47181,47182,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.309,PORTIA,Being so father'd and so husbanded?
47182,47183,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.310,PORTIA,"Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:"
47183,47184,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.311,PORTIA,"I have made strong proof of my constancy,"
47184,47185,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.312,PORTIA,Giving myself a voluntary wound
47185,47186,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.313,PORTIA,"Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience."
47186,47187,Julius Caesar,71.0,2.1.314,PORTIA,And not my husband's secrets?
47187,47188,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.315,BRUTUS,"O ye gods,"
47188,47189,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.316,BRUTUS,Render me worthy of this noble wife!
47189,47190,Julius Caesar,72.0,,BRUTUS,Knocking within
47190,47191,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.317,BRUTUS,"Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile,"
47191,47192,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.318,BRUTUS,And by and by thy bosom shall partake
47192,47193,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.319,BRUTUS,The secrets of my heart.
47193,47194,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.320,BRUTUS,"All my engagements I will construe to thee,"
47194,47195,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.321,BRUTUS,All the charactery of my sad brows:
47195,47196,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.322,BRUTUS,Leave me with haste.
47196,47197,Julius Caesar,72.0,,BRUTUS,Exit PORTIA
47197,47198,Julius Caesar,72.0,2.1.323,BRUTUS,"Lucius, who's that knocks?"
47198,47199,Julius Caesar,72.0,,BRUTUS,Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS
47199,47200,Julius Caesar,73.0,2.1.324,LUCIUS,He is a sick man that would speak with you.
47200,47201,Julius Caesar,74.0,2.1.325,BRUTUS,"Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of."
47201,47202,Julius Caesar,74.0,2.1.326,BRUTUS,"Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?"
47202,47203,Julius Caesar,75.0,2.1.327,LIGARIUS,Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
47203,47204,Julius Caesar,76.0,2.1.328,BRUTUS,"O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,"
47204,47205,Julius Caesar,76.0,2.1.329,BRUTUS,To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
47205,47206,Julius Caesar,77.0,2.1.330,LIGARIUS,"I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand"
47206,47207,Julius Caesar,77.0,2.1.331,LIGARIUS,Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
47207,47208,Julius Caesar,78.0,2.1.332,BRUTUS,"Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,"
47208,47209,Julius Caesar,78.0,2.1.333,BRUTUS,Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
47209,47210,Julius Caesar,79.0,2.1.334,LIGARIUS,"By all the gods that Romans bow before,"
47210,47211,Julius Caesar,79.0,2.1.335,LIGARIUS,I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
47211,47212,Julius Caesar,79.0,2.1.336,LIGARIUS,"Brave son, derived from honourable loins!"
47212,47213,Julius Caesar,79.0,2.1.337,LIGARIUS,"Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up"
47213,47214,Julius Caesar,79.0,2.1.338,LIGARIUS,"My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,"
47214,47215,Julius Caesar,79.0,2.1.339,LIGARIUS,"And I will strive with things impossible,"
47215,47216,Julius Caesar,79.0,2.1.340,LIGARIUS,"Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?"
47216,47217,Julius Caesar,80.0,2.1.341,BRUTUS,A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
47217,47218,Julius Caesar,81.0,2.1.342,LIGARIUS,But are not some whole that we must make sick?
47218,47219,Julius Caesar,82.0,2.1.343,BRUTUS,"That must we also. What it is, my Caius,"
47219,47220,Julius Caesar,82.0,2.1.344,BRUTUS,"I shall unfold to thee, as we are going"
47220,47221,Julius Caesar,82.0,2.1.345,BRUTUS,To whom it must be done.
47221,47222,Julius Caesar,83.0,2.1.346,LIGARIUS,"Set on your foot,"
47222,47223,Julius Caesar,83.0,2.1.347,LIGARIUS,"And with a heart new-fired I follow you,"
47223,47224,Julius Caesar,83.0,2.1.348,LIGARIUS,To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
47224,47225,Julius Caesar,83.0,2.1.349,LIGARIUS,That Brutus leads me on.
47225,47226,Julius Caesar,84.0,2.1.350,BRUTUS,"Follow me, then."
47226,47227,Julius Caesar,84.0,,BRUTUS,Exeunt
47227,47228,Julius Caesar,84.0,,BRUTUS,SCENE II. CAESAR's house.
47228,47229,Julius Caesar,84.0,,BRUTUS,"Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown"
47229,47230,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.2.1,CAESAR,Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
47230,47231,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.2.2,CAESAR,"Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,"
47231,47232,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.2.3,CAESAR,"'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?"
47232,47233,Julius Caesar,1.0,,CAESAR,Enter a Servant
47233,47234,Julius Caesar,2.0,2.2.4,Servant,My lord?
47234,47235,Julius Caesar,3.0,2.2.5,CAESAR,Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
47235,47236,Julius Caesar,3.0,2.2.6,CAESAR,And bring me their opinions of success.
47236,47237,Julius Caesar,4.0,2.2.7,Servant,"I will, my lord."
47237,47238,Julius Caesar,4.0,,Servant,Exit
47238,47239,Julius Caesar,4.0,,Servant,Enter CALPURNIA
47239,47240,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.2.8,CALPURNIA,"What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?"
47240,47241,Julius Caesar,5.0,2.2.9,CALPURNIA,You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
47241,47242,Julius Caesar,6.0,2.2.10,CAESAR,Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
47242,47243,Julius Caesar,6.0,2.2.11,CAESAR,"Ne'er look'd but on my back, when they shall see"
47243,47244,Julius Caesar,6.0,2.2.12,CAESAR,"The face of Caesar, they are vanished."
47244,47245,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.13,CALPURNIA,"Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,"
47245,47246,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.14,CALPURNIA,"Yet now they fright me. There is one within,"
47246,47247,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.15,CALPURNIA,"Besides the things that we have heard and seen,"
47247,47248,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.16,CALPURNIA,Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
47248,47249,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.17,CALPURNIA,"A lioness hath whelped in the streets,"
47249,47250,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.18,CALPURNIA,"And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead,"
47250,47251,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.19,CALPURNIA,"Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,"
47251,47252,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.20,CALPURNIA,"In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,"
47252,47253,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.21,CALPURNIA,"Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol,"
47253,47254,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.22,CALPURNIA,"The noise of battle hurtled in the air,"
47254,47255,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.23,CALPURNIA,"Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,"
47255,47256,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.24,CALPURNIA,And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
47256,47257,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.25,CALPURNIA,"O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,"
47257,47258,Julius Caesar,7.0,2.2.26,CALPURNIA,And I do fear them.
47258,47259,Julius Caesar,8.0,2.2.27,CAESAR,What can be avoided
47259,47260,Julius Caesar,8.0,2.2.28,CAESAR,Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
47260,47261,Julius Caesar,8.0,2.2.29,CAESAR,"Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions"
47261,47262,Julius Caesar,8.0,2.2.30,CAESAR,Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
47262,47263,Julius Caesar,9.0,2.2.31,CALPURNIA,"When beggars die, there are no comets seen,"
47263,47264,Julius Caesar,9.0,2.2.32,CALPURNIA,The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
47264,47265,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.2.33,CAESAR,"Cowards die many times before their deaths,"
47265,47266,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.2.34,CAESAR,The valiant never taste of death but once.
47266,47267,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.2.35,CAESAR,Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
47267,47268,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.2.36,CAESAR,"It seems to me most strange that men should fear,"
47268,47269,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.2.37,CAESAR,"Seeing that death, a necessary end,"
47269,47270,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.2.38,CAESAR,Will come when it will come.
47270,47271,Julius Caesar,10.0,,CAESAR,Re-enter Servant
47271,47272,Julius Caesar,10.0,2.2.39,CAESAR,What say the augurers?
47272,47273,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.2.40,Servant,They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
47273,47274,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.2.41,Servant,"Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,"
47274,47275,Julius Caesar,11.0,2.2.42,Servant,They could not find a heart within the beast.
47275,47276,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.43,CAESAR,The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
47276,47277,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.44,CAESAR,"Caesar should be a beast without a heart,"
47277,47278,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.45,CAESAR,If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
47278,47279,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.46,CAESAR,"No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well"
47279,47280,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.47,CAESAR,That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
47280,47281,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.48,CAESAR,"We are two lions litter'd in one day,"
47281,47282,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.49,CAESAR,And I the elder and more terrible:
47282,47283,Julius Caesar,12.0,2.2.50,CAESAR,And Caesar shall go forth.
47283,47284,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.2.51,CALPURNIA,"Alas, my lord,"
47284,47285,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.2.52,CALPURNIA,Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
47285,47286,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.2.53,CALPURNIA,Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
47286,47287,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.2.54,CALPURNIA,"That keeps you in the house, and not your own."
47287,47288,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.2.55,CALPURNIA,We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
47288,47289,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.2.56,CALPURNIA,And he shall say you are not well to-day:
47289,47290,Julius Caesar,13.0,2.2.57,CALPURNIA,"Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this."
47290,47291,Julius Caesar,14.0,2.2.58,CAESAR,"Mark Antony shall say I am not well,"
47291,47292,Julius Caesar,14.0,2.2.59,CAESAR,"And, for thy humour, I will stay at home."
47292,47293,Julius Caesar,14.0,,CAESAR,Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
47293,47294,Julius Caesar,14.0,2.2.60,CAESAR,"Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so."
47294,47295,Julius Caesar,15.0,2.2.61,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:"
47295,47296,Julius Caesar,15.0,2.2.62,DECIUS BRUTUS,I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
47296,47297,Julius Caesar,16.0,2.2.63,CAESAR,"And you are come in very happy time,"
47297,47298,Julius Caesar,16.0,2.2.64,CAESAR,To bear my greeting to the senators
47298,47299,Julius Caesar,16.0,2.2.65,CAESAR,And tell them that I will not come to-day:
47299,47300,Julius Caesar,16.0,2.2.66,CAESAR,"Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:"
47300,47301,Julius Caesar,16.0,2.2.67,CAESAR,"I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius."
47301,47302,Julius Caesar,17.0,2.2.68,CALPURNIA,Say he is sick.
47302,47303,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.2.69,CAESAR,Shall Caesar send a lie?
47303,47304,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.2.70,CAESAR,"Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,"
47304,47305,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.2.71,CAESAR,To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
47305,47306,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.2.72,CAESAR,"Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come."
47306,47307,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.2.73,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,"
47307,47308,Julius Caesar,19.0,2.2.74,DECIUS BRUTUS,Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
47308,47309,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.75,CAESAR,"The cause is in my will: I will not come,"
47309,47310,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.76,CAESAR,That is enough to satisfy the senate.
47310,47311,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.77,CAESAR,"But for your private satisfaction,"
47311,47312,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.78,CAESAR,"Because I love you, I will let you know:"
47312,47313,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.79,CAESAR,"Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:"
47313,47314,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.80,CAESAR,"She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,"
47314,47315,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.81,CAESAR,"Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,"
47315,47316,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.82,CAESAR,Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
47316,47317,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.83,CAESAR,"Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:"
47317,47318,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.84,CAESAR,"And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,"
47318,47319,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.85,CAESAR,"And evils imminent, and on her knee"
47319,47320,Julius Caesar,20.0,2.2.86,CAESAR,Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
47320,47321,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.87,DECIUS BRUTUS,"This dream is all amiss interpreted,"
47321,47322,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.88,DECIUS BRUTUS,It was a vision fair and fortunate:
47322,47323,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.89,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,"
47323,47324,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.90,DECIUS BRUTUS,"In which so many smiling Romans bathed,"
47324,47325,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.91,DECIUS BRUTUS,Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
47325,47326,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.92,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Reviving blood, and that great men shall press"
47326,47327,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.93,DECIUS BRUTUS,"For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance."
47327,47328,Julius Caesar,21.0,2.2.94,DECIUS BRUTUS,This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
47328,47329,Julius Caesar,22.0,2.2.95,CAESAR,And this way have you well expounded it.
47329,47330,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.96,DECIUS BRUTUS,"I have, when you have heard what I can say:"
47330,47331,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.97,DECIUS BRUTUS,And know it now: the senate have concluded
47331,47332,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.98,DECIUS BRUTUS,To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
47332,47333,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.99,DECIUS BRUTUS,"If you shall send them word you will not come,"
47333,47334,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.100,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock"
47334,47335,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.101,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Apt to be render'd, for some one to say"
47335,47336,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.102,DECIUS BRUTUS,"'Break up the senate till another time,"
47336,47337,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.103,DECIUS BRUTUS,When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
47337,47338,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.104,DECIUS BRUTUS,"If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper"
47338,47339,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.105,DECIUS BRUTUS,"'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?"
47339,47340,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.106,DECIUS BRUTUS,"Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love"
47340,47341,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.107,DECIUS BRUTUS,"To our proceeding bids me tell you this,"
47341,47342,Julius Caesar,23.0,2.2.108,DECIUS BRUTUS,And reason to my love is liable.
47342,47343,Julius Caesar,24.0,2.2.109,CAESAR,"How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!"
47343,47344,Julius Caesar,24.0,2.2.110,CAESAR,I am ashamed I did yield to them.
47344,47345,Julius Caesar,24.0,2.2.111,CAESAR,"Give me my robe, for I will go."
47345,47346,Julius Caesar,24.0,,CAESAR,"Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA"
47346,47347,Julius Caesar,24.0,2.2.112,CAESAR,And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
47347,47348,Julius Caesar,25.0,2.2.113,PUBLIUS,"Good morrow, Caesar."
47348,47349,Julius Caesar,26.0,2.2.114,CAESAR,"Welcome, Publius."
47349,47350,Julius Caesar,26.0,2.2.115,CAESAR,"What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?"
47350,47351,Julius Caesar,26.0,2.2.116,CAESAR,"Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,"
47351,47352,Julius Caesar,26.0,2.2.117,CAESAR,Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
47352,47353,Julius Caesar,26.0,2.2.118,CAESAR,As that same ague which hath made you lean.
47353,47354,Julius Caesar,26.0,2.2.119,CAESAR,What is 't o'clock?
47354,47355,Julius Caesar,27.0,2.2.120,BRUTUS,"Caesar, 'tis strucken eight."
47355,47356,Julius Caesar,28.0,2.2.121,CAESAR,I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
47356,47357,Julius Caesar,28.0,,CAESAR,Enter ANTONY
47357,47358,Julius Caesar,28.0,2.2.122,CAESAR,"See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,"
47358,47359,Julius Caesar,28.0,2.2.123,CAESAR,"Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony."
47359,47360,Julius Caesar,29.0,2.2.124,ANTONY,So to most noble Caesar.
47360,47361,Julius Caesar,30.0,2.2.125,CAESAR,Bid them prepare within:
47361,47362,Julius Caesar,30.0,2.2.126,CAESAR,I am to blame to be thus waited for.
47362,47363,Julius Caesar,30.0,2.2.127,CAESAR,"Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!"

47367,47368,Julius Caesar,31.0,,TREBONIUS,Aside

47369,47370,Julius Caesar,31.0,2.2.133,TREBONIUS,That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
47370,47371,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.2.134,CAESAR,"Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me,"
47371,47372,Julius Caesar,32.0,2.2.135,CAESAR,"And we, like friends, will straightway go together."

47382,47383,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.3.6,ARTEMIDORUS,"bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,"
47383,47384,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.3.7,ARTEMIDORUS,look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
47384,47385,Julius Caesar,1.0,2.3.8,ARTEMIDORUS,"The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,"

47402,47403,Julius Caesar,3.0,2.4.8,PORTIA,Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
47403,47404,Julius Caesar,3.0,2.4.9,PORTIA,"I have a man's mind, but a woman's might."

47431,47432,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.4.36,Soothsayer,"None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance."
47432,47433,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.4.37,Soothsayer,Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:

47434,47435,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.4.39,Soothsayer,"Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,"
47435,47436,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.4.40,Soothsayer,Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
47436,47437,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.4.41,Soothsayer,"I'll get me to a place more void, and there"
47437,47438,Julius Caesar,18.0,2.4.42,Soothsayer,Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

47529,47530,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.1.75,CASSIUS,"Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,"
47530,47531,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.1.76,CASSIUS,"Let me a little show it, even in this,"
47531,47532,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.1.77,CASSIUS,"That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,"
47532,47533,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.1.78,CASSIUS,And constant do remain to keep him so.

47548,47549,Julius Caesar,41.0,3.1.92,DECIUS BRUTUS,And Cassius too.
47549,47550,Julius Caesar,42.0,3.1.93,BRUTUS,Where's Publius?
47550,47551,Julius Caesar,43.0,3.1.94,CINNA,"Here, quite confounded with this mutiny."
47551,47552,Julius Caesar,44.0,3.1.95,METELLUS CIMBER,"Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's"
47552,47553,Julius Caesar,44.0,3.1.96,METELLUS CIMBER,Should chance--
47553,47554,Julius Caesar,45.0,3.1.97,BRUTUS,"Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,"
47554,47555,Julius Caesar,45.0,3.1.98,BRUTUS,"There is no harm intended to your person,"
47555,47556,Julius Caesar,45.0,3.1.99,BRUTUS,"Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius."
47556,47557,Julius Caesar,46.0,3.1.100,CASSIUS,"And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,"
47557,47558,Julius Caesar,46.0,3.1.101,CASSIUS,"Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief."
47558,47559,Julius Caesar,47.0,3.1.102,BRUTUS,"Do so: and let no man abide this deed,"
47559,47560,Julius Caesar,47.0,3.1.103,BRUTUS,But we the doers.
47560,47561,Julius Caesar,47.0,,BRUTUS,Re-enter TREBONIUS
47561,47562,Julius Caesar,48.0,3.1.104,CASSIUS,Where is Antony?
47562,47563,Julius Caesar,49.0,3.1.105,TREBONIUS,Fled to his house amazed:
47563,47564,Julius Caesar,49.0,3.1.106,TREBONIUS,"Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run"
47564,47565,Julius Caesar,49.0,3.1.107,TREBONIUS,As it were doomsday.
47565,47566,Julius Caesar,50.0,3.1.108,BRUTUS,"Fates, we will know your pleasures:"
47566,47567,Julius Caesar,50.0,3.1.109,BRUTUS,"That we shall die, we know, 'tis but the time"
47567,47568,Julius Caesar,50.0,3.1.110,BRUTUS,"And drawing days out, that men stand upon."
47568,47569,Julius Caesar,51.0,3.1.111,CASSIUS,"Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life"
47569,47570,Julius Caesar,51.0,3.1.112,CASSIUS,Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
47570,47571,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.113,BRUTUS,"Grant that, and then is death a benefit:"
47571,47572,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.114,BRUTUS,"So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged"
47572,47573,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.115,BRUTUS,"His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,"
47573,47574,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.116,BRUTUS,And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
47574,47575,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.117,BRUTUS,"Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:"
47575,47576,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.118,BRUTUS,"Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,"
47576,47577,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.119,BRUTUS,"And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,"
47577,47578,Julius Caesar,52.0,3.1.120,BRUTUS,"Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'"
47578,47579,Julius Caesar,53.0,3.1.121,CASSIUS,"Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence"
47579,47580,Julius Caesar,53.0,3.1.122,CASSIUS,Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
47580,47581,Julius Caesar,53.0,3.1.123,CASSIUS,In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
47581,47582,Julius Caesar,54.0,3.1.124,BRUTUS,"How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,"
47582,47583,Julius Caesar,54.0,3.1.125,BRUTUS,That now on Pompey's basis lies along
47583,47584,Julius Caesar,54.0,3.1.126,BRUTUS,No worthier than the dust!
47584,47585,Julius Caesar,55.0,3.1.127,CASSIUS,"So oft as that shall be,"
47585,47586,Julius Caesar,55.0,3.1.128,CASSIUS,So often shall the knot of us be call'd
47586,47587,Julius Caesar,55.0,3.1.129,CASSIUS,The men that gave their country liberty.
47587,47588,Julius Caesar,56.0,3.1.130,DECIUS BRUTUS,"What, shall we forth?"
47588,47589,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.1.131,CASSIUS,"Ay, every man away:"
47589,47590,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.1.132,CASSIUS,"Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels"
47590,47591,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.1.133,CASSIUS,With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
47591,47592,Julius Caesar,57.0,,CASSIUS,Enter a Servant
47592,47593,Julius Caesar,58.0,3.1.134,BRUTUS,Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
47593,47594,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.135,Servant,"Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:"
47594,47595,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.136,Servant,"Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,"
47595,47596,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.137,Servant,"And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:"
47596,47597,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.138,Servant,"Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest,"
47597,47598,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.139,Servant,"Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:"
47598,47599,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.140,Servant,"Say I love Brutus, and I honour him,"
47599,47600,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.141,Servant,"Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him."
47600,47601,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.142,Servant,If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
47601,47602,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.143,Servant,"May safely come to him, and be resolved"
47602,47603,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.144,Servant,"How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,"
47603,47604,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.145,Servant,Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
47604,47605,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.146,Servant,"So well as Brutus living, but will follow"
47605,47606,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.147,Servant,The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
47606,47607,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.148,Servant,Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
47607,47608,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.1.149,Servant,With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
47608,47609,Julius Caesar,60.0,3.1.150,BRUTUS,"Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman,"
47609,47610,Julius Caesar,60.0,3.1.151,BRUTUS,I never thought him worse.
47610,47611,Julius Caesar,60.0,3.1.152,BRUTUS,"Tell him, so please him come unto this place,"
47611,47612,Julius Caesar,60.0,3.1.153,BRUTUS,"He shall be satisfied, and, by my honour,"
47612,47613,Julius Caesar,60.0,3.1.154,BRUTUS,Depart untouch'd.
47613,47614,Julius Caesar,61.0,3.1.155,Servant,I'll fetch him presently.
47614,47615,Julius Caesar,61.0,,Servant,Exit
47615,47616,Julius Caesar,62.0,3.1.156,BRUTUS,I know that we shall have him well to friend.
47616,47617,Julius Caesar,63.0,3.1.157,CASSIUS,I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
47617,47618,Julius Caesar,63.0,3.1.158,CASSIUS,"That fears him much, and my misgiving still"
47618,47619,Julius Caesar,63.0,3.1.159,CASSIUS,Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
47619,47620,Julius Caesar,64.0,3.1.160,BRUTUS,But here comes Antony.
47620,47621,Julius Caesar,64.0,,BRUTUS,Re-enter ANTONY
47621,47622,Julius Caesar,64.0,3.1.161,BRUTUS,"Welcome, Mark Antony."
47622,47623,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.162,ANTONY,O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
47623,47624,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.163,ANTONY,"Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,"
47624,47625,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.164,ANTONY,Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
47625,47626,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.165,ANTONY,"I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,"
47626,47627,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.166,ANTONY,"Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:"
47627,47628,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.167,ANTONY,"If I myself, there is no hour so fit"
47628,47629,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.168,ANTONY,"As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument"
47629,47630,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.169,ANTONY,"Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich"
47630,47631,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.170,ANTONY,With the most noble blood of all this world.
47631,47632,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.171,ANTONY,"I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,"
47632,47633,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.172,ANTONY,"Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,"
47633,47634,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.173,ANTONY,"Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,"
47634,47635,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.174,ANTONY,I shall not find myself so apt to die:
47635,47636,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.175,ANTONY,"No place will please me so, no mean of death,"
47636,47637,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.176,ANTONY,"As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,"
47637,47638,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.1.177,ANTONY,The choice and master spirits of this age.
47638,47639,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.178,BRUTUS,"O Antony, beg not your death of us."
47639,47640,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.179,BRUTUS,"Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,"
47640,47641,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.180,BRUTUS,"As, by our hands and this our present act,"
47641,47642,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.181,BRUTUS,"You see we do, yet see you but our hands"
47642,47643,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.182,BRUTUS,And this the bleeding business they have done:
47643,47644,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.183,BRUTUS,"Our hearts you see not, they are pitiful,"
47644,47645,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.184,BRUTUS,And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
47645,47646,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.185,BRUTUS,"As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--"
47646,47647,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.186,BRUTUS,"Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,"
47647,47648,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.187,BRUTUS,"To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:"
47648,47649,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.188,BRUTUS,"Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts"
47649,47650,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.189,BRUTUS,"Of brothers' temper, do receive you in"
47650,47651,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.1.190,BRUTUS,"With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence."
47651,47652,Julius Caesar,67.0,3.1.191,CASSIUS,Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
47652,47653,Julius Caesar,67.0,3.1.192,CASSIUS,In the disposing of new dignities.
47653,47654,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.1.193,BRUTUS,Only be patient till we have appeased
47654,47655,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.1.194,BRUTUS,"The multitude, beside themselves with fear,"
47655,47656,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.1.195,BRUTUS,"And then we will deliver you the cause,"
47656,47657,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.1.196,BRUTUS,"Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,"
47657,47658,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.1.197,BRUTUS,Have thus proceeded.
47658,47659,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.198,ANTONY,I doubt not of your wisdom.
47659,47660,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.199,ANTONY,Let each man render me his bloody hand:
47660,47661,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.200,ANTONY,"First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you,"
47661,47662,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.201,ANTONY,"Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand,"
47662,47663,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.202,ANTONY,"Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus,"
47663,47664,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.203,ANTONY,"Yours, Cinna, and, my valiant Casca, yours,"
47664,47665,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.204,ANTONY,"Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius."
47665,47666,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.205,ANTONY,"Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?"
47666,47667,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.206,ANTONY,"My credit now stands on such slippery ground,"
47667,47668,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.207,ANTONY,"That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,"
47668,47669,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.208,ANTONY,Either a coward or a flatterer.
47669,47670,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.209,ANTONY,"That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:"
47670,47671,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.210,ANTONY,"If then thy spirit look upon us now,"
47671,47672,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.211,ANTONY,"Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,"
47672,47673,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.212,ANTONY,"To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,"
47673,47674,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.213,ANTONY,"Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,"
47674,47675,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.214,ANTONY,Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
47675,47676,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.215,ANTONY,"Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,"
47676,47677,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.216,ANTONY,"Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,"
47677,47678,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.217,ANTONY,It would become me better than to close
47678,47679,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.218,ANTONY,In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
47679,47680,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.219,ANTONY,"Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,"
47680,47681,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.220,ANTONY,"Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,"
47681,47682,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.221,ANTONY,"Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe."
47682,47683,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.222,ANTONY,"O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,"
47683,47684,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.223,ANTONY,"And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee."
47684,47685,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.224,ANTONY,"How like a deer, strucken by many princes,"
47685,47686,Julius Caesar,69.0,3.1.225,ANTONY,Dost thou here lie!
47686,47687,Julius Caesar,70.0,3.1.226,CASSIUS,"Mark Antony,--"
47687,47688,Julius Caesar,71.0,3.1.227,ANTONY,"Pardon me, Caius Cassius:"
47688,47689,Julius Caesar,71.0,3.1.228,ANTONY,"The enemies of Caesar shall say this,"
47689,47690,Julius Caesar,71.0,3.1.229,ANTONY,"Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty."
47690,47691,Julius Caesar,72.0,3.1.230,CASSIUS,"I blame you not for praising Caesar so,"
47691,47692,Julius Caesar,72.0,3.1.231,CASSIUS,But what compact mean you to have with us?
47692,47693,Julius Caesar,72.0,3.1.232,CASSIUS,"Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,"
47693,47694,Julius Caesar,72.0,3.1.233,CASSIUS,"Or shall we on, and not depend on you?"
47694,47695,Julius Caesar,73.0,3.1.234,ANTONY,"Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,"
47695,47696,Julius Caesar,73.0,3.1.235,ANTONY,"Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar."
47696,47697,Julius Caesar,73.0,3.1.236,ANTONY,"Friends am I with you all and love you all,"
47697,47698,Julius Caesar,73.0,3.1.237,ANTONY,"Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons"
47698,47699,Julius Caesar,73.0,3.1.238,ANTONY,Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
47699,47700,Julius Caesar,74.0,3.1.239,BRUTUS,Or else were this a savage spectacle:
47700,47701,Julius Caesar,74.0,3.1.240,BRUTUS,Our reasons are so full of good regard
47701,47702,Julius Caesar,74.0,3.1.241,BRUTUS,"That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,"
47702,47703,Julius Caesar,74.0,3.1.242,BRUTUS,You should be satisfied.
47703,47704,Julius Caesar,75.0,3.1.243,ANTONY,That's all I seek:
47704,47705,Julius Caesar,75.0,3.1.244,ANTONY,And am moreover suitor that I may
47705,47706,Julius Caesar,75.0,3.1.245,ANTONY,"Produce his body to the market-place,"
47706,47707,Julius Caesar,75.0,3.1.246,ANTONY,"And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,"
47707,47708,Julius Caesar,75.0,3.1.247,ANTONY,Speak in the order of his funeral.
47708,47709,Julius Caesar,76.0,3.1.248,BRUTUS,"You shall, Mark Antony."
47709,47710,Julius Caesar,77.0,3.1.249,CASSIUS,"Brutus, a word with you."
47710,47711,Julius Caesar,77.0,,CASSIUS,Aside to BRUTUS
47711,47712,Julius Caesar,77.0,3.1.250,CASSIUS,You know not what you do: do not consent
47712,47713,Julius Caesar,77.0,3.1.251,CASSIUS,That Antony speak in his funeral:
47713,47714,Julius Caesar,77.0,3.1.252,CASSIUS,Know you how much the people may be moved
47714,47715,Julius Caesar,77.0,3.1.253,CASSIUS,By that which he will utter?
47715,47716,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.254,BRUTUS,"By your pardon,"
47716,47717,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.255,BRUTUS,"I will myself into the pulpit first,"
47717,47718,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.256,BRUTUS,And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
47718,47719,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.257,BRUTUS,"What Antony shall speak, I will protest"
47719,47720,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.258,BRUTUS,"He speaks by leave and by permission,"
47720,47721,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.259,BRUTUS,And that we are contented Caesar shall
47721,47722,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.260,BRUTUS,Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
47722,47723,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.1.261,BRUTUS,It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
47723,47724,Julius Caesar,79.0,3.1.262,CASSIUS,"I know not what may fall, I like it not."
47724,47725,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.263,BRUTUS,"Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body."
47725,47726,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.264,BRUTUS,"You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,"
47726,47727,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.265,BRUTUS,"But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,"
47727,47728,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.266,BRUTUS,"And say you do't by our permission,"
47728,47729,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.267,BRUTUS,Else shall you not have any hand at all
47729,47730,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.268,BRUTUS,About his funeral: and you shall speak
47730,47731,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.269,BRUTUS,"In the same pulpit whereto I am going,"
47731,47732,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.1.270,BRUTUS,After my speech is ended.
47732,47733,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.1.271,ANTONY,Be it so.
47733,47734,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.1.272,ANTONY,I do desire no more.
47734,47735,Julius Caesar,82.0,3.1.273,BRUTUS,"Prepare the body then, and follow us."
47735,47736,Julius Caesar,82.0,,BRUTUS,Exeunt all but ANTONY
47736,47737,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.274,ANTONY,"O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,"
47737,47738,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.275,ANTONY,That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
47738,47739,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.276,ANTONY,Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
47739,47740,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.277,ANTONY,That ever lived in the tide of times.
47740,47741,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.278,ANTONY,Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
47741,47742,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.279,ANTONY,"Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--"
47742,47743,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.280,ANTONY,"Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,"
47743,47744,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.281,ANTONY,To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
47744,47745,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.282,ANTONY,"A curse shall light upon the limbs of men,"
47745,47746,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.283,ANTONY,Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
47746,47747,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.284,ANTONY,"Shall cumber all the parts of Italy,"
47747,47748,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.285,ANTONY,Blood and destruction shall be so in use
47748,47749,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.286,ANTONY,And dreadful objects so familiar
47749,47750,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.287,ANTONY,That mothers shall but smile when they behold
47750,47751,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.288,ANTONY,"Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war,"
47751,47752,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.289,ANTONY,All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
47752,47753,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.290,ANTONY,"And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,"
47753,47754,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.291,ANTONY,"With Ate by his side come hot from hell,"
47754,47755,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.292,ANTONY,Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
47755,47756,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.293,ANTONY,"Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war,"
47756,47757,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.294,ANTONY,That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
47757,47758,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.295,ANTONY,"With carrion men, groaning for burial."
47758,47759,Julius Caesar,83.0,,ANTONY,Enter a Servant
47759,47760,Julius Caesar,83.0,3.1.296,ANTONY,"You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?"
47760,47761,Julius Caesar,84.0,3.1.297,Servant,"I do, Mark Antony."
47761,47762,Julius Caesar,85.0,3.1.298,ANTONY,Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
47762,47763,Julius Caesar,86.0,3.1.299,Servant,"He did receive his letters, and is coming,"
47763,47764,Julius Caesar,86.0,3.1.300,Servant,And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
47764,47765,Julius Caesar,86.0,3.1.301,Servant,O Caesar!--
47765,47766,Julius Caesar,86.0,,Servant,Seeing the body
47766,47767,Julius Caesar,87.0,3.1.302,ANTONY,"Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep."
47767,47768,Julius Caesar,87.0,3.1.303,ANTONY,"Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,"
47768,47769,Julius Caesar,87.0,3.1.304,ANTONY,"Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,"
47769,47770,Julius Caesar,87.0,3.1.305,ANTONY,Began to water. Is thy master coming?
47770,47771,Julius Caesar,88.0,3.1.306,Servant,He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
47771,47772,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.307,ANTONY,"Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:"
47772,47773,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.308,ANTONY,"Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,"
47773,47774,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.309,ANTONY,"No Rome of safety for Octavius yet,"
47774,47775,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.310,ANTONY,"Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile,"
47775,47776,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.311,ANTONY,Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
47776,47777,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.312,ANTONY,Into the market-place: there shall I try
47777,47778,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.313,ANTONY,"In my oration, how the people take"
47778,47779,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.314,ANTONY,"The cruel issue of these bloody men,"
47779,47780,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.315,ANTONY,"According to the which, thou shalt discourse"
47780,47781,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.316,ANTONY,To young Octavius of the state of things.
47781,47782,Julius Caesar,89.0,3.1.317,ANTONY,Lend me your hand.
47782,47783,Julius Caesar,89.0,,ANTONY,Exeunt with CAESAR's body
47783,47784,Julius Caesar,89.0,,ANTONY,SCENE II. The Forum.
47784,47785,Julius Caesar,89.0,,ANTONY,"Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens"
47785,47786,Julius Caesar,1.0,3.2.1,Citizens,"We will be satisfied, let us be satisfied."
47786,47787,Julius Caesar,2.0,3.2.2,BRUTUS,"Then follow me, and give me audience, friends."
47787,47788,Julius Caesar,2.0,3.2.3,BRUTUS,"Cassius, go you into the other street,"
47788,47789,Julius Caesar,2.0,3.2.4,BRUTUS,And part the numbers.
47789,47790,Julius Caesar,2.0,3.2.5,BRUTUS,"Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here,"
47790,47791,Julius Caesar,2.0,3.2.6,BRUTUS,"Those that will follow Cassius, go with him,"
47791,47792,Julius Caesar,2.0,3.2.7,BRUTUS,And public reasons shall be rendered
47792,47793,Julius Caesar,2.0,3.2.8,BRUTUS,Of Caesar's death.
47793,47794,Julius Caesar,3.0,3.2.9,First Citizen,I will hear Brutus speak.
47794,47795,Julius Caesar,4.0,3.2.10,Second Citizen,"I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons,"
47795,47796,Julius Caesar,4.0,3.2.11,Second Citizen,When severally we hear them rendered.
47796,47797,Julius Caesar,4.0,,Second Citizen,"Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit"
47797,47798,Julius Caesar,5.0,3.2.12,Third Citizen,The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
47798,47799,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.13,BRUTUS,Be patient till the last.
47799,47800,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.14,BRUTUS,"Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my"
47800,47801,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.15,BRUTUS,"cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me"
47801,47802,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.16,BRUTUS,"for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that"
47802,47803,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.17,BRUTUS,"you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and"
47803,47804,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.18,BRUTUS,"awake your senses, that you may the better judge."
47804,47805,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.19,BRUTUS,"If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of"
47805,47806,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.20,BRUTUS,"Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar"
47806,47807,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.21,BRUTUS,was no less than his. If then that friend demand
47807,47808,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.22,BRUTUS,"why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:"
47808,47809,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.23,BRUTUS,"--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved"
47809,47810,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.24,BRUTUS,Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
47810,47811,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.25,BRUTUS,"die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live"
47811,47812,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.26,BRUTUS,"all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him,"
47812,47813,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.27,BRUTUS,"as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it, as he was"
47813,47814,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.28,BRUTUS,"valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I"
47814,47815,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.29,BRUTUS,"slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his"
47815,47816,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.30,BRUTUS,"fortune, honour for his valour, and death for his"
47816,47817,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.31,BRUTUS,ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
47817,47818,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.32,BRUTUS,"bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended."
47818,47819,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.33,BRUTUS,Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
47819,47820,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.34,BRUTUS,"any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so"
47820,47821,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.35,BRUTUS,"vile that will not love his country? If any, speak,"
47821,47822,Julius Caesar,6.0,3.2.36,BRUTUS,for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
47822,47823,Julius Caesar,7.0,3.2.37,All,"None, Brutus, none."
47823,47824,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.38,BRUTUS,Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
47824,47825,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.39,BRUTUS,Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
47825,47826,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.40,BRUTUS,"his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not"
47826,47827,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.41,BRUTUS,"extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences"
47827,47828,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.42,BRUTUS,"enforced, for which he suffered death."
47828,47829,Julius Caesar,8.0,,BRUTUS,"Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body"
47829,47830,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.43,BRUTUS,"Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,"
47830,47831,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.44,BRUTUS,"though he had no hand in his death, shall receive"
47831,47832,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.45,BRUTUS,"the benefit of his dying, a place in the"
47832,47833,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.46,BRUTUS,"commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With this"
47833,47834,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.47,BRUTUS,"I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the"
47834,47835,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.48,BRUTUS,"good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,"
47835,47836,Julius Caesar,8.0,3.2.49,BRUTUS,when it shall please my country to need my death.
47836,47837,Julius Caesar,9.0,3.2.50,All,"Live, Brutus! live, live!"
47837,47838,Julius Caesar,10.0,3.2.51,First Citizen,Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
47838,47839,Julius Caesar,11.0,3.2.52,Second Citizen,Give him a statue with his ancestors.
47839,47840,Julius Caesar,12.0,3.2.53,Third Citizen,Let him be Caesar.
47840,47841,Julius Caesar,13.0,3.2.54,Fourth Citizen,Caesar's better parts
47841,47842,Julius Caesar,13.0,3.2.55,Fourth Citizen,Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
47842,47843,Julius Caesar,14.0,3.2.56,First Citizen,We'll bring him to his house
47843,47844,Julius Caesar,14.0,3.2.57,First Citizen,With shouts and clamours.
47844,47845,Julius Caesar,15.0,3.2.58,BRUTUS,"My countrymen,--"
47845,47846,Julius Caesar,16.0,3.2.59,Second Citizen,"Peace, silence! Brutus speaks."
47846,47847,Julius Caesar,17.0,3.2.60,First Citizen,"Peace, ho!"
47847,47848,Julius Caesar,18.0,3.2.61,BRUTUS,"Good countrymen, let me depart alone,"
47848,47849,Julius Caesar,18.0,3.2.62,BRUTUS,"And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:"
47849,47850,Julius Caesar,18.0,3.2.63,BRUTUS,"Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech"
47850,47851,Julius Caesar,18.0,3.2.64,BRUTUS,"Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,"
47851,47852,Julius Caesar,18.0,3.2.65,BRUTUS,"By our permission, is allow'd to make."
47852,47853,Julius Caesar,18.0,3.2.66,BRUTUS,"I do entreat you, not a man depart,"
47853,47854,Julius Caesar,18.0,3.2.67,BRUTUS,"Save I alone, till Antony have spoke."
47854,47855,Julius Caesar,18.0,,BRUTUS,Exit
47855,47856,Julius Caesar,19.0,3.2.68,First Citizen,"Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony."
47856,47857,Julius Caesar,20.0,3.2.69,Third Citizen,"Let him go up into the public chair,"
47857,47858,Julius Caesar,20.0,3.2.70,Third Citizen,"We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up."
47858,47859,Julius Caesar,21.0,3.2.71,ANTONY,"For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you."
47859,47860,Julius Caesar,21.0,,ANTONY,Goes into the pulpit
47860,47861,Julius Caesar,22.0,3.2.72,Fourth Citizen,What does he say of Brutus?
47861,47862,Julius Caesar,23.0,3.2.73,Third Citizen,"He says, for Brutus' sake,"
47862,47863,Julius Caesar,23.0,3.2.74,Third Citizen,He finds himself beholding to us all.
47863,47864,Julius Caesar,24.0,3.2.75,Fourth Citizen,'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
47864,47865,Julius Caesar,25.0,3.2.76,First Citizen,This Caesar was a tyrant.
47865,47866,Julius Caesar,26.0,3.2.77,Third Citizen,"Nay, that's certain:"
47866,47867,Julius Caesar,26.0,3.2.78,Third Citizen,We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
47867,47868,Julius Caesar,27.0,3.2.79,Second Citizen,Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
47868,47869,Julius Caesar,28.0,3.2.80,ANTONY,"You gentle Romans,--"
47869,47870,Julius Caesar,29.0,3.2.81,Citizens,"Peace, ho! let us hear him."
47870,47871,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.82,ANTONY,"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears,"
47871,47872,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.83,ANTONY,"I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him."
47872,47873,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.84,ANTONY,"The evil that men do lives after them,"
47873,47874,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.85,ANTONY,"The good is oft interred with their bones,"
47874,47875,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.86,ANTONY,So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
47875,47876,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.87,ANTONY,Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
47876,47877,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.88,ANTONY,"If it were so, it was a grievous fault,"
47877,47878,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.89,ANTONY,And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
47878,47879,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.90,ANTONY,"Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--"
47879,47880,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.91,ANTONY,"For Brutus is an honourable man,"
47880,47881,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.92,ANTONY,"So are they all, all honourable men--"
47881,47882,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.93,ANTONY,Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
47882,47883,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.94,ANTONY,"He was my friend, faithful and just to me:"
47883,47884,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.95,ANTONY,"But Brutus says he was ambitious,"
47884,47885,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.96,ANTONY,And Brutus is an honourable man.
47885,47886,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.97,ANTONY,He hath brought many captives home to Rome
47886,47887,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.98,ANTONY,Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
47887,47888,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.99,ANTONY,Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
47888,47889,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.100,ANTONY,"When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:"
47889,47890,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.101,ANTONY,Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
47890,47891,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.102,ANTONY,"Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,"
47891,47892,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.103,ANTONY,And Brutus is an honourable man.
47892,47893,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.104,ANTONY,You all did see that on the Lupercal
47893,47894,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.105,ANTONY,"I thrice presented him a kingly crown,"
47894,47895,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.106,ANTONY,Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
47895,47896,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.107,ANTONY,"Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,"
47896,47897,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.108,ANTONY,"And, sure, he is an honourable man."
47897,47898,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.109,ANTONY,"I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,"
47898,47899,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.110,ANTONY,But here I am to speak what I do know.
47899,47900,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.111,ANTONY,"You all did love him once, not without cause:"
47900,47901,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.112,ANTONY,"What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?"
47901,47902,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.113,ANTONY,"O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,"
47902,47903,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.114,ANTONY,"And men have lost their reason. Bear with me,"
47903,47904,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.115,ANTONY,"My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,"
47904,47905,Julius Caesar,30.0,3.2.116,ANTONY,And I must pause till it come back to me.
47905,47906,Julius Caesar,31.0,3.2.117,First Citizen,Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
47906,47907,Julius Caesar,32.0,3.2.118,Second Citizen,"If thou consider rightly of the matter,"
47907,47908,Julius Caesar,32.0,3.2.119,Second Citizen,Caesar has had great wrong.
47908,47909,Julius Caesar,33.0,3.2.120,Third Citizen,"Has he, masters?"
47909,47910,Julius Caesar,33.0,3.2.121,Third Citizen,I fear there will a worse come in his place.
47910,47911,Julius Caesar,34.0,3.2.122,Fourth Citizen,"Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown,"
47911,47912,Julius Caesar,34.0,3.2.123,Fourth Citizen,Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
47912,47913,Julius Caesar,35.0,3.2.124,First Citizen,"If it be found so, some will dear abide it."
47913,47914,Julius Caesar,36.0,3.2.125,Second Citizen,Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
47914,47915,Julius Caesar,37.0,3.2.126,Third Citizen,There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
47915,47916,Julius Caesar,38.0,3.2.127,Fourth Citizen,"Now mark him, he begins again to speak."
47916,47917,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.128,ANTONY,But yesterday the word of Caesar might
47917,47918,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.129,ANTONY,"Have stood against the world, now lies he there."
47918,47919,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.130,ANTONY,And none so poor to do him reverence.
47919,47920,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.131,ANTONY,"O masters, if I were disposed to stir"
47920,47921,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.132,ANTONY,"Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,"
47921,47922,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.133,ANTONY,"I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,"
47922,47923,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.134,ANTONY,"Who, you all know, are honourable men:"
47923,47924,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.135,ANTONY,"I will not do them wrong, I rather choose"
47924,47925,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.136,ANTONY,"To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,"
47925,47926,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.137,ANTONY,Than I will wrong such honourable men.
47926,47927,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.138,ANTONY,"But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar,"
47927,47928,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.139,ANTONY,"I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:"
47928,47929,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.140,ANTONY,Let but the commons hear this testament--
47929,47930,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.141,ANTONY,"Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--"
47930,47931,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.142,ANTONY,And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
47931,47932,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.143,ANTONY,"And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,"
47932,47933,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.144,ANTONY,"Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,"
47933,47934,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.145,ANTONY,"And, dying, mention it within their wills,"
47934,47935,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.146,ANTONY,Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
47935,47936,Julius Caesar,39.0,3.2.147,ANTONY,Unto their issue.

47939,47940,Julius Caesar,42.0,3.2.151,ANTONY,It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
47940,47941,Julius Caesar,42.0,3.2.152,ANTONY,"You are not wood, you are not stones, but men,"
47941,47942,Julius Caesar,42.0,3.2.153,ANTONY,"And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,"
47942,47943,Julius Caesar,42.0,3.2.154,ANTONY,"It will inflame you, it will make you mad:"
47943,47944,Julius Caesar,42.0,3.2.155,ANTONY,"'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,"
47944,47945,Julius Caesar,42.0,3.2.156,ANTONY,"For, if you should, O, what would come of it!"
47945,47946,Julius Caesar,43.0,3.2.157,Fourth Citizen,"Read the will, we'll hear it, Antony,"
47946,47947,Julius Caesar,43.0,3.2.158,Fourth Citizen,"You shall read us the will, Caesar's will."
47947,47948,Julius Caesar,44.0,3.2.159,ANTONY,Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
47948,47949,Julius Caesar,44.0,3.2.160,ANTONY,I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
47949,47950,Julius Caesar,44.0,3.2.161,ANTONY,I fear I wrong the honourable men
47950,47951,Julius Caesar,44.0,3.2.162,ANTONY,"Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar, I do fear it."
47951,47952,Julius Caesar,45.0,3.2.163,Fourth Citizen,They were traitors: honourable men!
47952,47953,Julius Caesar,46.0,3.2.164,All,The will! the testament!
47953,47954,Julius Caesar,47.0,3.2.165,Second Citizen,"They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will."
47954,47955,Julius Caesar,48.0,3.2.166,ANTONY,"You will compel me, then, to read the will?"
47955,47956,Julius Caesar,48.0,3.2.167,ANTONY,"Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,"
47956,47957,Julius Caesar,48.0,3.2.168,ANTONY,And let me show you him that made the will.
47957,47958,Julius Caesar,48.0,3.2.169,ANTONY,Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
47958,47959,Julius Caesar,49.0,3.2.170,Several Citizens,Come down.
47959,47960,Julius Caesar,50.0,3.2.171,Second Citizen,Descend.

47964,47965,Julius Caesar,54.0,3.2.175,Second Citizen,"Room for Antony, most noble Antony."
47965,47966,Julius Caesar,55.0,3.2.176,ANTONY,"Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off."
47966,47967,Julius Caesar,56.0,3.2.177,Several Citizens,"Stand back, room, bear back."
47967,47968,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.178,ANTONY,"If you have tears, prepare to shed them now."
47968,47969,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.179,ANTONY,You all do know this mantle: I remember
47969,47970,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.180,ANTONY,"The first time ever Caesar put it on,"
47970,47971,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.181,ANTONY,"'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,"
47971,47972,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.182,ANTONY,That day he overcame the Nervii:
47972,47973,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.183,ANTONY,"Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:"
47973,47974,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.184,ANTONY,See what a rent the envious Casca made:
47974,47975,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.185,ANTONY,"Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd,"
47975,47976,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.186,ANTONY,"And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,"
47976,47977,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.187,ANTONY,"Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,"
47977,47978,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.188,ANTONY,"As rushing out of doors, to be resolved"
47978,47979,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.189,ANTONY,"If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no,"
47979,47980,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.190,ANTONY,"For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:"
47980,47981,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.191,ANTONY,"Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!"
47981,47982,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.192,ANTONY,"This was the most unkindest cut of all,"
47982,47983,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.193,ANTONY,"For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,"
47983,47984,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.194,ANTONY,"Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,"
47984,47985,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.195,ANTONY,"Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart,"
47985,47986,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.196,ANTONY,"And, in his mantle muffling up his face,"
47986,47987,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.197,ANTONY,"Even at the base of Pompey's statua,"
47987,47988,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.198,ANTONY,"Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell."
47988,47989,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.199,ANTONY,"O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!"
47989,47990,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.200,ANTONY,"Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,"
47990,47991,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.201,ANTONY,Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
47991,47992,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.202,ANTONY,"O, now you weep, and, I perceive, you feel"
47992,47993,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.203,ANTONY,The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
47993,47994,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.204,ANTONY,"Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold"
47994,47995,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.205,ANTONY,"Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,"
47995,47996,Julius Caesar,57.0,3.2.206,ANTONY,"Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors."
47996,47997,Julius Caesar,58.0,3.2.207,First Citizen,O piteous spectacle!
47997,47998,Julius Caesar,59.0,3.2.208,Second Citizen,O noble Caesar!
47998,47999,Julius Caesar,60.0,3.2.209,Third Citizen,O woful day!

48000,48001,Julius Caesar,62.0,3.2.211,First Citizen,O most bloody sight!
48001,48002,Julius Caesar,63.0,3.2.212,Second Citizen,We will be revenged.
48002,48003,Julius Caesar,64.0,3.2.213,All,Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
48003,48004,Julius Caesar,64.0,3.2.214,All,Let not a traitor live!
48004,48005,Julius Caesar,65.0,3.2.215,ANTONY,"Stay, countrymen."
48005,48006,Julius Caesar,66.0,3.2.216,First Citizen,Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
48006,48007,Julius Caesar,67.0,3.2.217,Second Citizen,"We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him."
48007,48008,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.218,ANTONY,"Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up"
48008,48009,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.219,ANTONY,To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
48009,48010,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.220,ANTONY,They that have done this deed are honourable:
48010,48011,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.221,ANTONY,"What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,"
48011,48012,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.222,ANTONY,"That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,"
48012,48013,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.223,ANTONY,"And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you."
48013,48014,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.224,ANTONY,"I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:"
48014,48015,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.225,ANTONY,"I am no orator, as Brutus is,"
48015,48016,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.226,ANTONY,"But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,"
48016,48017,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.227,ANTONY,"That love my friend, and that they know full well"
48017,48018,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.228,ANTONY,That gave me public leave to speak of him:
48018,48019,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.229,ANTONY,"For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,"
48019,48020,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.230,ANTONY,"Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,"
48020,48021,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.231,ANTONY,"To stir men's blood: I only speak right on,"
48021,48022,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.232,ANTONY,"I tell you that which you yourselves do know,"
48022,48023,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.233,ANTONY,"Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,"
48023,48024,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.234,ANTONY,"And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,"
48024,48025,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.235,ANTONY,"And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony"
48025,48026,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.236,ANTONY,Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
48026,48027,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.237,ANTONY,In every wound of Caesar that should move
48027,48028,Julius Caesar,68.0,3.2.238,ANTONY,The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

48034,48035,Julius Caesar,74.0,3.2.245,ANTONY,Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
48035,48036,Julius Caesar,74.0,3.2.246,ANTONY,"Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:"
48036,48037,Julius Caesar,74.0,3.2.247,ANTONY,You have forgot the will I told you of.
48037,48038,Julius Caesar,75.0,3.2.248,All,Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
48038,48039,Julius Caesar,76.0,3.2.249,ANTONY,"Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal."
48039,48040,Julius Caesar,76.0,3.2.250,ANTONY,"To every Roman citizen he gives,"
48040,48041,Julius Caesar,76.0,3.2.251,ANTONY,"To every several man, seventy-five drachmas."
48041,48042,Julius Caesar,77.0,3.2.252,Second Citizen,Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
48042,48043,Julius Caesar,78.0,3.2.253,Third Citizen,O royal Caesar!
48043,48044,Julius Caesar,79.0,3.2.254,ANTONY,Hear me with patience.
48044,48045,Julius Caesar,80.0,3.2.255,All,"Peace, ho!"
48045,48046,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.2.256,ANTONY,"Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,"
48046,48047,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.2.257,ANTONY,"His private arbours and new-planted orchards,"
48047,48048,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.2.258,ANTONY,"On this side Tiber, he hath left them you,"
48048,48049,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.2.259,ANTONY,"And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,"
48049,48050,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.2.260,ANTONY,"To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves."
48050,48051,Julius Caesar,81.0,3.2.261,ANTONY,Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?

48068,48069,Julius Caesar,90.0,3.2.277,ANTONY,And in this mood will give us any thing.
48069,48070,Julius Caesar,91.0,3.2.278,Servant,"I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius"
48070,48071,Julius Caesar,91.0,3.2.279,Servant,Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.

48072,48073,Julius Caesar,92.0,3.2.281,ANTONY,How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.

48166,48167,Julius Caesar,13.0,4.1.50,ANTONY,And open perils surest answered.
48167,48168,Julius Caesar,14.0,4.1.51,OCTAVIUS,"Let us do so: for we are at the stake,"
48168,48169,Julius Caesar,14.0,4.1.52,OCTAVIUS,"And bay'd about with many enemies,"
48169,48170,Julius Caesar,14.0,4.1.53,OCTAVIUS,"And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,"
48170,48171,Julius Caesar,14.0,4.1.54,OCTAVIUS,Millions of mischiefs.

48177,48178,Julius Caesar,4.0,4.2.4,LUCILIUS,"He is at hand, and Pindarus is come"
48178,48179,Julius Caesar,4.0,4.2.5,LUCILIUS,To do you salutation from his master.
48179,48180,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.2.6,BRUTUS,"He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,"
48180,48181,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.2.7,BRUTUS,"In his own change, or by ill officers,"
48181,48182,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.2.8,BRUTUS,Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
48182,48183,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.2.9,BRUTUS,"Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,"
48183,48184,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.2.10,BRUTUS,I shall be satisfied.

48187,48188,Julius Caesar,7.0,4.2.14,BRUTUS,"He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,"
48188,48189,Julius Caesar,7.0,4.2.15,BRUTUS,"How he received you, let me be resolved."
48189,48190,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.2.16,LUCILIUS,"With courtesy and with respect enough,"
48190,48191,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.2.17,LUCILIUS,"But not with such familiar instances,"
48191,48192,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.2.18,LUCILIUS,"Nor with such free and friendly conference,"
48192,48193,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.2.19,LUCILIUS,As he hath used of old.
48193,48194,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.20,BRUTUS,Thou hast described

48196,48197,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.23,BRUTUS,It useth an enforced ceremony.
48197,48198,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.24,BRUTUS,"There are no tricks in plain and simple faith,"
48198,48199,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.25,BRUTUS,"But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,"
48199,48200,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.26,BRUTUS,"Make gallant show and promise of their mettle,"
48200,48201,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.27,BRUTUS,"But when they should endure the bloody spur,"
48201,48202,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.28,BRUTUS,"They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,"
48202,48203,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.2.29,BRUTUS,Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
48203,48204,Julius Caesar,10.0,4.2.30,LUCILIUS,"They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd,"

48216,48217,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.2.41,BRUTUS,"Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?"
48217,48218,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.2.42,BRUTUS,"And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?"
48218,48219,Julius Caesar,19.0,4.2.43,CASSIUS,"Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,"
48219,48220,Julius Caesar,19.0,4.2.44,CASSIUS,And when you do them--
48220,48221,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.2.45,BRUTUS,"Cassius, be content."
48221,48222,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.2.46,BRUTUS,Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
48222,48223,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.2.47,BRUTUS,"Before the eyes of both our armies here,"

48224,48225,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.2.49,BRUTUS,"Let us not wrangle: bid them move away,"
48225,48226,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.2.50,BRUTUS,"Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,"
48226,48227,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.2.51,BRUTUS,And I will give you audience.
48227,48228,Julius Caesar,21.0,4.2.52,CASSIUS,"Pindarus,"
48228,48229,Julius Caesar,21.0,4.2.53,CASSIUS,Bid our commanders lead their charges off
48229,48230,Julius Caesar,21.0,4.2.54,CASSIUS,A little from this ground.
48230,48231,Julius Caesar,22.0,4.2.55,BRUTUS,"Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man"
48231,48232,Julius Caesar,22.0,4.2.56,BRUTUS,Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
48232,48233,Julius Caesar,22.0,4.2.57,BRUTUS,Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.

48235,48236,Julius Caesar,22.0,,BRUTUS,Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS
48236,48237,Julius Caesar,1.0,4.3.1,CASSIUS,That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
48237,48238,Julius Caesar,1.0,4.3.2,CASSIUS,You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
48238,48239,Julius Caesar,1.0,4.3.3,CASSIUS,"For taking bribes here of the Sardians,"
48239,48240,Julius Caesar,1.0,4.3.4,CASSIUS,"Wherein my letters, praying on his side,"
48240,48241,Julius Caesar,1.0,4.3.5,CASSIUS,"Because I knew the man, were slighted off."
48241,48242,Julius Caesar,2.0,4.3.6,BRUTUS,You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
48242,48243,Julius Caesar,3.0,4.3.7,CASSIUS,In such a time as this it is not meet
48243,48244,Julius Caesar,3.0,4.3.8,CASSIUS,That every nice offence should bear his comment.
48244,48245,Julius Caesar,4.0,4.3.9,BRUTUS,"Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself"
48245,48246,Julius Caesar,4.0,4.3.10,BRUTUS,"Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,"
48246,48247,Julius Caesar,4.0,4.3.11,BRUTUS,To sell and mart your offices for gold
48247,48248,Julius Caesar,4.0,4.3.12,BRUTUS,To undeservers.
48248,48249,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.3.13,CASSIUS,I an itching palm!
48249,48250,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.3.14,CASSIUS,"You know that you are Brutus that speak this,"
48250,48251,Julius Caesar,5.0,4.3.15,CASSIUS,"Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last."
48251,48252,Julius Caesar,6.0,4.3.16,BRUTUS,"The name of Cassius honours this corruption,"
48252,48253,Julius Caesar,6.0,4.3.17,BRUTUS,And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
48253,48254,Julius Caesar,7.0,4.3.18,CASSIUS,Chastisement!
48254,48255,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.19,BRUTUS,"Remember March, the ides of March remember:"
48255,48256,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.20,BRUTUS,Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
48256,48257,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.21,BRUTUS,"What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,"
48257,48258,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.22,BRUTUS,"And not for justice? What, shall one of us"
48258,48259,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.23,BRUTUS,That struck the foremost man of all this world
48259,48260,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.24,BRUTUS,"But for supporting robbers, shall we now"
48260,48261,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.25,BRUTUS,"Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,"
48261,48262,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.26,BRUTUS,And sell the mighty space of our large honours
48262,48263,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.27,BRUTUS,For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
48263,48264,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.28,BRUTUS,"I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,"
48264,48265,Julius Caesar,8.0,4.3.29,BRUTUS,Than such a Roman.
48265,48266,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.3.30,CASSIUS,"Brutus, bay not me,"
48266,48267,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.3.31,CASSIUS,"I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,"
48267,48268,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.3.32,CASSIUS,"To hedge me in, I am a soldier, I,"
48268,48269,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.3.33,CASSIUS,"Older in practise, abler than yourself"
48269,48270,Julius Caesar,9.0,4.3.34,CASSIUS,To make conditions.
48270,48271,Julius Caesar,10.0,4.3.35,BRUTUS,"Go to, you are not, Cassius."
48271,48272,Julius Caesar,11.0,4.3.36,CASSIUS,I am.
48272,48273,Julius Caesar,12.0,4.3.37,BRUTUS,I say you are not.
48273,48274,Julius Caesar,13.0,4.3.38,CASSIUS,"Urge me no more, I shall forget myself,"
48274,48275,Julius Caesar,13.0,4.3.39,CASSIUS,"Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further."
48275,48276,Julius Caesar,14.0,4.3.40,BRUTUS,"Away, slight man!"
48276,48277,Julius Caesar,15.0,4.3.41,CASSIUS,Is't possible?
48277,48278,Julius Caesar,16.0,4.3.42,BRUTUS,"Hear me, for I will speak."
48278,48279,Julius Caesar,16.0,4.3.43,BRUTUS,Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
48279,48280,Julius Caesar,16.0,4.3.44,BRUTUS,Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
48280,48281,Julius Caesar,17.0,4.3.45,CASSIUS,"O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?"
48281,48282,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.46,BRUTUS,"All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break,"
48282,48283,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.47,BRUTUS,"Go show your slaves how choleric you are,"
48283,48284,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.48,BRUTUS,And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
48284,48285,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.49,BRUTUS,Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
48285,48286,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.50,BRUTUS,Under your testy humour? By the gods
48286,48287,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.51,BRUTUS,"You shall digest the venom of your spleen,"
48287,48288,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.52,BRUTUS,"Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,"
48288,48289,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.53,BRUTUS,"I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,"
48289,48290,Julius Caesar,18.0,4.3.54,BRUTUS,When you are waspish.
48290,48291,Julius Caesar,19.0,4.3.55,CASSIUS,Is it come to this?
48291,48292,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.3.56,BRUTUS,You say you are a better soldier:
48292,48293,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.3.57,BRUTUS,"Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,"
48293,48294,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.3.58,BRUTUS,"And it shall please me well: for mine own part,"
48294,48295,Julius Caesar,20.0,4.3.59,BRUTUS,I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
48295,48296,Julius Caesar,21.0,4.3.60,CASSIUS,"You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus,"
48296,48297,Julius Caesar,21.0,4.3.61,CASSIUS,"I said, an elder soldier, not a better:"
48297,48298,Julius Caesar,21.0,4.3.62,CASSIUS,Did I say 'better'?
48298,48299,Julius Caesar,22.0,4.3.63,BRUTUS,"If you did, I care not."
48299,48300,Julius Caesar,23.0,4.3.64,CASSIUS,"When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me."
48300,48301,Julius Caesar,24.0,4.3.65,BRUTUS,"Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him."
48301,48302,Julius Caesar,25.0,4.3.66,CASSIUS,I durst not!
48302,48303,Julius Caesar,26.0,4.3.67,BRUTUS,No.
48303,48304,Julius Caesar,27.0,4.3.68,CASSIUS,"What, durst not tempt him!"
48304,48305,Julius Caesar,28.0,4.3.69,BRUTUS,For your life you durst not!
48305,48306,Julius Caesar,29.0,4.3.70,CASSIUS,"Do not presume too much upon my love,"
48306,48307,Julius Caesar,29.0,4.3.71,CASSIUS,I may do that I shall be sorry for.
48307,48308,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.72,BRUTUS,You have done that you should be sorry for.
48308,48309,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.73,BRUTUS,"There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,"
48309,48310,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.74,BRUTUS,For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
48310,48311,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.75,BRUTUS,"That they pass by me as the idle wind,"
48311,48312,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.76,BRUTUS,Which I respect not. I did send to you
48312,48313,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.77,BRUTUS,"For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:"
48313,48314,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.78,BRUTUS,For I can raise no money by vile means:
48314,48315,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.79,BRUTUS,"By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,"
48315,48316,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.80,BRUTUS,"And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring"
48316,48317,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.81,BRUTUS,From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
48317,48318,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.82,BRUTUS,By any indirection: I did send
48318,48319,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.83,BRUTUS,"To you for gold to pay my legions,"
48319,48320,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.84,BRUTUS,Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
48320,48321,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.85,BRUTUS,Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
48321,48322,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.86,BRUTUS,"When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,"
48322,48323,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.87,BRUTUS,"To lock such rascal counters from his friends,"
48323,48324,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.88,BRUTUS,"Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,"
48324,48325,Julius Caesar,30.0,4.3.89,BRUTUS,Dash him to pieces!
48325,48326,Julius Caesar,31.0,4.3.90,CASSIUS,I denied you not.
48326,48327,Julius Caesar,32.0,4.3.91,BRUTUS,You did.
48327,48328,Julius Caesar,33.0,4.3.92,CASSIUS,I did not: he was but a fool that brought
48328,48329,Julius Caesar,33.0,4.3.93,CASSIUS,My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
48329,48330,Julius Caesar,33.0,4.3.94,CASSIUS,"A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,"
48330,48331,Julius Caesar,33.0,4.3.95,CASSIUS,But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
48331,48332,Julius Caesar,34.0,4.3.96,BRUTUS,"I do not, till you practise them on me."
48332,48333,Julius Caesar,35.0,4.3.97,CASSIUS,You love me not.
48333,48334,Julius Caesar,36.0,4.3.98,BRUTUS,I do not like your faults.
48334,48335,Julius Caesar,37.0,4.3.99,CASSIUS,A friendly eye could never see such faults.
48335,48336,Julius Caesar,38.0,4.3.100,BRUTUS,"A flatterer's would not, though they do appear"
48336,48337,Julius Caesar,38.0,4.3.101,BRUTUS,As huge as high Olympus.
48337,48338,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.102,CASSIUS,"Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,"
48338,48339,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.103,CASSIUS,"Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,"
48339,48340,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.104,CASSIUS,"For Cassius is aweary of the world,"
48340,48341,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.105,CASSIUS,"Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother,"
48341,48342,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.106,CASSIUS,"Cheque'd like a bondman, all his faults observed,"
48342,48343,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.107,CASSIUS,"Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,"
48343,48344,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.108,CASSIUS,"To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep"
48344,48345,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.109,CASSIUS,"My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,"
48345,48346,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.110,CASSIUS,"And here my naked breast, within, a heart"
48346,48347,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.111,CASSIUS,"Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:"
48347,48348,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.112,CASSIUS,"If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth,"
48348,48349,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.113,CASSIUS,"I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:"
48349,48350,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.114,CASSIUS,"Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for, I know,"
48350,48351,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.115,CASSIUS,"When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better"
48351,48352,Julius Caesar,39.0,4.3.116,CASSIUS,Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
48352,48353,Julius Caesar,40.0,4.3.117,BRUTUS,Sheathe your dagger:
48353,48354,Julius Caesar,40.0,4.3.118,BRUTUS,"Be angry when you will, it shall have scope,"
48354,48355,Julius Caesar,40.0,4.3.119,BRUTUS,"Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour."
48355,48356,Julius Caesar,40.0,4.3.120,BRUTUS,"O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb"
48356,48357,Julius Caesar,40.0,4.3.121,BRUTUS,"That carries anger as the flint bears fire,"
48357,48358,Julius Caesar,40.0,4.3.122,BRUTUS,"Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,"
48358,48359,Julius Caesar,40.0,4.3.123,BRUTUS,And straight is cold again.
48359,48360,Julius Caesar,41.0,4.3.124,CASSIUS,Hath Cassius lived
48360,48361,Julius Caesar,41.0,4.3.125,CASSIUS,"To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,"
48361,48362,Julius Caesar,41.0,4.3.126,CASSIUS,"When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?"
48362,48363,Julius Caesar,42.0,4.3.127,BRUTUS,"When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too."
48363,48364,Julius Caesar,43.0,4.3.128,CASSIUS,Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
48364,48365,Julius Caesar,44.0,4.3.129,BRUTUS,And my heart too.
48365,48366,Julius Caesar,45.0,4.3.130,CASSIUS,O Brutus!
48366,48367,Julius Caesar,46.0,4.3.131,BRUTUS,What's the matter?
48367,48368,Julius Caesar,47.0,4.3.132,CASSIUS,"Have not you love enough to bear with me,"
48368,48369,Julius Caesar,47.0,4.3.133,CASSIUS,When that rash humour which my mother gave me
48369,48370,Julius Caesar,47.0,4.3.134,CASSIUS,Makes me forgetful?
48370,48371,Julius Caesar,48.0,4.3.135,BRUTUS,"Yes, Cassius, and, from henceforth,"
48371,48372,Julius Caesar,48.0,4.3.136,BRUTUS,"When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,"
48372,48373,Julius Caesar,48.0,4.3.137,BRUTUS,"He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so."
48373,48374,Julius Caesar,49.0,4.3.138,Poet,"[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals,"
48374,48375,Julius Caesar,49.0,4.3.139,Poet,"There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet"
48375,48376,Julius Caesar,49.0,4.3.140,Poet,They be alone.
48376,48377,Julius Caesar,50.0,4.3.141,LUCILIUS,[Within]  You shall not come to them.
48377,48378,Julius Caesar,51.0,4.3.142,Poet,[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.
48378,48379,Julius Caesar,51.0,,Poet,"Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS"
48379,48380,Julius Caesar,52.0,4.3.143,CASSIUS,How now! what's the matter?
48380,48381,Julius Caesar,53.0,4.3.144,Poet,"For shame, you generals! what do you mean?"
48381,48382,Julius Caesar,53.0,4.3.145,Poet,"Love, and be friends, as two such men should be,"
48382,48383,Julius Caesar,53.0,4.3.146,Poet,"For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye."
48383,48384,Julius Caesar,54.0,4.3.147,CASSIUS,"Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!"
48384,48385,Julius Caesar,55.0,4.3.148,BRUTUS,"Get you hence, sirrah, saucy fellow, hence!"
48385,48386,Julius Caesar,56.0,4.3.149,CASSIUS,"Bear with him, Brutus, 'tis his fashion."
48386,48387,Julius Caesar,57.0,4.3.150,BRUTUS,"I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:"
48387,48388,Julius Caesar,57.0,4.3.151,BRUTUS,What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
48388,48389,Julius Caesar,57.0,4.3.152,BRUTUS,"Companion, hence!"
48389,48390,Julius Caesar,58.0,4.3.153,CASSIUS,"Away, away, be gone."
48390,48391,Julius Caesar,58.0,,CASSIUS,Exit Poet
48391,48392,Julius Caesar,59.0,4.3.154,BRUTUS,"Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders"
48392,48393,Julius Caesar,59.0,4.3.155,BRUTUS,Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
48393,48394,Julius Caesar,60.0,4.3.156,CASSIUS,"And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you"
48394,48395,Julius Caesar,60.0,4.3.157,CASSIUS,Immediately to us.
48395,48396,Julius Caesar,60.0,,CASSIUS,Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS
48396,48397,Julius Caesar,61.0,4.3.158,BRUTUS,"Lucius, a bowl of wine!"
48397,48398,Julius Caesar,61.0,,BRUTUS,Exit LUCIUS
48398,48399,Julius Caesar,62.0,4.3.159,CASSIUS,I did not think you could have been so angry.
48399,48400,Julius Caesar,63.0,4.3.160,BRUTUS,"O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs."
48400,48401,Julius Caesar,64.0,4.3.161,CASSIUS,"Of your philosophy you make no use,"
48401,48402,Julius Caesar,64.0,4.3.162,CASSIUS,If you give place to accidental evils.
48402,48403,Julius Caesar,65.0,4.3.163,BRUTUS,No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
48403,48404,Julius Caesar,66.0,4.3.164,CASSIUS,Ha! Portia!
48404,48405,Julius Caesar,67.0,4.3.165,BRUTUS,She is dead.
48405,48406,Julius Caesar,68.0,4.3.166,CASSIUS,How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
48406,48407,Julius Caesar,68.0,4.3.167,CASSIUS,O insupportable and touching loss!
48407,48408,Julius Caesar,68.0,4.3.168,CASSIUS,Upon what sickness?
48408,48409,Julius Caesar,69.0,4.3.169,BRUTUS,"Impatient of my absence,"
48409,48410,Julius Caesar,69.0,4.3.170,BRUTUS,And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
48410,48411,Julius Caesar,69.0,4.3.171,BRUTUS,Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
48411,48412,Julius Caesar,69.0,4.3.172,BRUTUS,"That tidings came,--with this she fell distract,"
48412,48413,Julius Caesar,69.0,4.3.173,BRUTUS,"And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire."
48413,48414,Julius Caesar,70.0,4.3.174,CASSIUS,And died so?
48414,48415,Julius Caesar,71.0,4.3.175,BRUTUS,Even so.
48415,48416,Julius Caesar,72.0,4.3.176,CASSIUS,O ye immortal gods!
48416,48417,Julius Caesar,72.0,,CASSIUS,"Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper"
48417,48418,Julius Caesar,73.0,4.3.177,BRUTUS,Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
48418,48419,Julius Caesar,73.0,4.3.178,BRUTUS,"In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius."
48419,48420,Julius Caesar,74.0,4.3.179,CASSIUS,My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
48420,48421,Julius Caesar,74.0,4.3.180,CASSIUS,"Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup,"
48421,48422,Julius Caesar,74.0,4.3.181,CASSIUS,I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
48422,48423,Julius Caesar,75.0,4.3.182,BRUTUS,"Come in, Titinius!"
48423,48424,Julius Caesar,75.0,,BRUTUS,Exit LUCIUS
48424,48425,Julius Caesar,75.0,,BRUTUS,"Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA"
48425,48426,Julius Caesar,75.0,4.3.183,BRUTUS,"Welcome, good Messala."
48426,48427,Julius Caesar,75.0,4.3.184,BRUTUS,"Now sit we close about this taper here,"
48427,48428,Julius Caesar,75.0,4.3.185,BRUTUS,And call in question our necessities.
48428,48429,Julius Caesar,76.0,4.3.186,CASSIUS,"Portia, art thou gone?"
48429,48430,Julius Caesar,77.0,4.3.187,BRUTUS,"No more, I pray you."
48430,48431,Julius Caesar,77.0,4.3.188,BRUTUS,"Messala, I have here received letters,"
48431,48432,Julius Caesar,77.0,4.3.189,BRUTUS,That young Octavius and Mark Antony
48432,48433,Julius Caesar,77.0,4.3.190,BRUTUS,"Come down upon us with a mighty power,"
48433,48434,Julius Caesar,77.0,4.3.191,BRUTUS,Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
48434,48435,Julius Caesar,78.0,4.3.192,MESSALA,Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
48435,48436,Julius Caesar,79.0,4.3.193,BRUTUS,With what addition?
48436,48437,Julius Caesar,80.0,4.3.194,MESSALA,"That by proscription and bills of outlawry,"
48437,48438,Julius Caesar,80.0,4.3.195,MESSALA,"Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,"
48438,48439,Julius Caesar,80.0,4.3.196,MESSALA,Have put to death an hundred senators.
48439,48440,Julius Caesar,81.0,4.3.197,BRUTUS,"Therein our letters do not well agree,"
48440,48441,Julius Caesar,81.0,4.3.198,BRUTUS,Mine speak of seventy senators that died
48441,48442,Julius Caesar,81.0,4.3.199,BRUTUS,"By their proscriptions, Cicero being one."
48442,48443,Julius Caesar,82.0,4.3.200,CASSIUS,Cicero one!
48443,48444,Julius Caesar,83.0,4.3.201,MESSALA,"Cicero is dead,"
48444,48445,Julius Caesar,83.0,4.3.202,MESSALA,And by that order of proscription.
48445,48446,Julius Caesar,83.0,4.3.203,MESSALA,"Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?"
48446,48447,Julius Caesar,84.0,4.3.204,BRUTUS,"No, Messala."
48447,48448,Julius Caesar,85.0,4.3.205,MESSALA,Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
48448,48449,Julius Caesar,86.0,4.3.206,BRUTUS,"Nothing, Messala."
48449,48450,Julius Caesar,87.0,4.3.207,MESSALA,"That, methinks, is strange."
48450,48451,Julius Caesar,88.0,4.3.208,BRUTUS,Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
48451,48452,Julius Caesar,89.0,4.3.209,MESSALA,"No, my lord."
48452,48453,Julius Caesar,90.0,4.3.210,BRUTUS,"Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true."
48453,48454,Julius Caesar,91.0,4.3.211,MESSALA,Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
48454,48455,Julius Caesar,91.0,4.3.212,MESSALA,"For certain she is dead, and by strange manner."
48455,48456,Julius Caesar,92.0,4.3.213,BRUTUS,"Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:"
48456,48457,Julius Caesar,92.0,4.3.214,BRUTUS,"With meditating that she must die once,"
48457,48458,Julius Caesar,92.0,4.3.215,BRUTUS,I have the patience to endure it now.
48458,48459,Julius Caesar,93.0,4.3.216,MESSALA,Even so great men great losses should endure.
48459,48460,Julius Caesar,94.0,4.3.217,CASSIUS,"I have as much of this in art as you,"
48460,48461,Julius Caesar,94.0,4.3.218,CASSIUS,But yet my nature could not bear it so.
48461,48462,Julius Caesar,95.0,4.3.219,BRUTUS,"Well, to our work alive. What do you think"
48462,48463,Julius Caesar,95.0,4.3.220,BRUTUS,Of marching to Philippi presently?
48463,48464,Julius Caesar,96.0,4.3.221,CASSIUS,I do not think it good.
48464,48465,Julius Caesar,97.0,4.3.222,BRUTUS,Your reason?
48465,48466,Julius Caesar,98.0,4.3.223,CASSIUS,This it is:
48466,48467,Julius Caesar,98.0,4.3.224,CASSIUS,'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
48467,48468,Julius Caesar,98.0,4.3.225,CASSIUS,"So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,"
48468,48469,Julius Caesar,98.0,4.3.226,CASSIUS,"Doing himself offence, whilst we, lying still,"
48469,48470,Julius Caesar,98.0,4.3.227,CASSIUS,"Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness."
48470,48471,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.228,BRUTUS,"Good reasons must, of force, give place to better."
48471,48472,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.229,BRUTUS,The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
48472,48473,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.230,BRUTUS,"Do stand but in a forced affection,"
48473,48474,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.231,BRUTUS,For they have grudged us contribution:
48474,48475,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.232,BRUTUS,"The enemy, marching along by them,"
48475,48476,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.233,BRUTUS,"By them shall make a fuller number up,"
48476,48477,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.234,BRUTUS,"Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged,"
48477,48478,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.235,BRUTUS,"From which advantage shall we cut him off,"
48478,48479,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.236,BRUTUS,"If at Philippi we do face him there,"
48479,48480,Julius Caesar,99.0,4.3.237,BRUTUS,These people at our back.
48480,48481,Julius Caesar,100.0,4.3.238,CASSIUS,"Hear me, good brother."
48481,48482,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.239,BRUTUS,"Under your pardon. You must note beside,"
48482,48483,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.240,BRUTUS,"That we have tried the utmost of our friends,"
48483,48484,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.241,BRUTUS,"Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:"
48484,48485,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.242,BRUTUS,"The enemy increaseth every day,"
48485,48486,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.243,BRUTUS,"We, at the height, are ready to decline."
48486,48487,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.244,BRUTUS,"There is a tide in the affairs of men,"
48487,48488,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.245,BRUTUS,"Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,"
48488,48489,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.246,BRUTUS,"Omitted, all the voyage of their life"
48489,48490,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.247,BRUTUS,Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
48490,48491,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.248,BRUTUS,"On such a full sea are we now afloat,"
48491,48492,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.249,BRUTUS,"And we must take the current when it serves,"
48492,48493,Julius Caesar,101.0,4.3.250,BRUTUS,Or lose our ventures.
48493,48494,Julius Caesar,102.0,4.3.251,CASSIUS,"Then, with your will, go on,"
48494,48495,Julius Caesar,102.0,4.3.252,CASSIUS,"We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi."
48495,48496,Julius Caesar,103.0,4.3.253,BRUTUS,"The deep of night is crept upon our talk,"
48496,48497,Julius Caesar,103.0,4.3.254,BRUTUS,"And nature must obey necessity,"
48497,48498,Julius Caesar,103.0,4.3.255,BRUTUS,Which we will niggard with a little rest.
48498,48499,Julius Caesar,103.0,4.3.256,BRUTUS,There is no more to say?
48499,48500,Julius Caesar,104.0,4.3.257,CASSIUS,No more. Good night:
48500,48501,Julius Caesar,104.0,4.3.258,CASSIUS,"Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence."
48501,48502,Julius Caesar,105.0,4.3.259,BRUTUS,Lucius!
48502,48503,Julius Caesar,105.0,,BRUTUS,Enter LUCIUS
48503,48504,Julius Caesar,105.0,4.3.260,BRUTUS,My gown.
48504,48505,Julius Caesar,105.0,,BRUTUS,Exit LUCIUS
48505,48506,Julius Caesar,105.0,4.3.261,BRUTUS,"Farewell, good Messala:"
48506,48507,Julius Caesar,105.0,4.3.262,BRUTUS,"Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,"
48507,48508,Julius Caesar,105.0,4.3.263,BRUTUS,"Good night, and good repose."
48508,48509,Julius Caesar,106.0,4.3.264,CASSIUS,O my dear brother!
48509,48510,Julius Caesar,106.0,4.3.265,CASSIUS,This was an ill beginning of the night:
48510,48511,Julius Caesar,106.0,4.3.266,CASSIUS,Never come such division 'tween our souls!
48511,48512,Julius Caesar,106.0,4.3.267,CASSIUS,"Let it not, Brutus."
48512,48513,Julius Caesar,107.0,4.3.268,BRUTUS,Every thing is well.
48513,48514,Julius Caesar,108.0,4.3.269,CASSIUS,"Good night, my lord."
48514,48515,Julius Caesar,109.0,4.3.270,BRUTUS,"Good night, good brother."
48515,48516,Julius Caesar,111.0,4.3.271,MESSALA,"Good night, Lord Brutus."
48516,48517,Julius Caesar,112.0,4.3.272,BRUTUS,"Farewell, every one."
48517,48518,Julius Caesar,112.0,,BRUTUS,Exeunt all but BRUTUS
48518,48519,Julius Caesar,112.0,,BRUTUS,"Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown"
48519,48520,Julius Caesar,112.0,4.3.273,BRUTUS,Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
48520,48521,Julius Caesar,113.0,4.3.274,LUCIUS,Here in the tent.
48521,48522,Julius Caesar,114.0,4.3.275,BRUTUS,"What, thou speak'st drowsily?"
48522,48523,Julius Caesar,114.0,4.3.276,BRUTUS,"Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'er-watch'd."
48523,48524,Julius Caesar,114.0,4.3.277,BRUTUS,Call Claudius and some other of my men:
48524,48525,Julius Caesar,114.0,4.3.278,BRUTUS,I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
48525,48526,Julius Caesar,115.0,4.3.279,LUCIUS,Varro and Claudius!
48526,48527,Julius Caesar,115.0,,LUCIUS,Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS
48527,48528,Julius Caesar,116.0,4.3.280,VARRO,Calls my lord?
48528,48529,Julius Caesar,117.0,4.3.281,BRUTUS,"I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep,"
48529,48530,Julius Caesar,117.0,4.3.282,BRUTUS,It may be I shall raise you by and by
48530,48531,Julius Caesar,117.0,4.3.283,BRUTUS,On business to my brother Cassius.
48531,48532,Julius Caesar,118.0,4.3.284,VARRO,"So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure."
48532,48533,Julius Caesar,119.0,4.3.285,BRUTUS,"I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs,"
48533,48534,Julius Caesar,119.0,4.3.286,BRUTUS,It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
48534,48535,Julius Caesar,119.0,4.3.287,BRUTUS,"Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so,"
48535,48536,Julius Caesar,119.0,4.3.288,BRUTUS,I put it in the pocket of my gown.
48536,48537,Julius Caesar,119.0,,BRUTUS,VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down
48537,48538,Julius Caesar,120.0,4.3.289,LUCIUS,I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
48538,48539,Julius Caesar,121.0,4.3.290,BRUTUS,"Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful."
48539,48540,Julius Caesar,121.0,4.3.291,BRUTUS,"Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,"
48540,48541,Julius Caesar,121.0,4.3.292,BRUTUS,And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
48541,48542,Julius Caesar,122.0,4.3.293,LUCIUS,"Ay, my lord, an't please you."
48542,48543,Julius Caesar,123.0,4.3.294,BRUTUS,"It does, my boy:"
48543,48544,Julius Caesar,123.0,4.3.295,BRUTUS,"I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing."
48544,48545,Julius Caesar,124.0,4.3.296,LUCIUS,"It is my duty, sir."
48545,48546,Julius Caesar,125.0,4.3.297,BRUTUS,"I should not urge thy duty past thy might,"
48546,48547,Julius Caesar,125.0,4.3.298,BRUTUS,I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
48547,48548,Julius Caesar,126.0,4.3.299,LUCIUS,"I have slept, my lord, already."
48548,48549,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.300,BRUTUS,"It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again,"
48549,48550,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.301,BRUTUS,"I will not hold thee long: if I do live,"
48550,48551,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.302,BRUTUS,I will be good to thee.
48551,48552,Julius Caesar,127.0,,BRUTUS,"Music, and a song"
48552,48553,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.303,BRUTUS,"This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,"
48553,48554,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.304,BRUTUS,"Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,"
48554,48555,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.305,BRUTUS,"That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night,"
48555,48556,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.306,BRUTUS,I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
48556,48557,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.307,BRUTUS,"If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument,"
48557,48558,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.308,BRUTUS,"I'll take it from thee, and, good boy, good night."
48558,48559,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.309,BRUTUS,"Let me see, let me see, is not the leaf turn'd down"
48559,48560,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.310,BRUTUS,"Where I left reading? Here it is, I think."
48560,48561,Julius Caesar,127.0,,BRUTUS,Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
48561,48562,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.311,BRUTUS,How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
48562,48563,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.312,BRUTUS,I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
48563,48564,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.313,BRUTUS,That shapes this monstrous apparition.
48564,48565,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.314,BRUTUS,It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
48565,48566,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.315,BRUTUS,"Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,"
48566,48567,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.316,BRUTUS,That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
48567,48568,Julius Caesar,127.0,4.3.317,BRUTUS,Speak to me what thou art.
48568,48569,Julius Caesar,128.0,4.3.318,GHOST,"Thy evil spirit, Brutus."
48569,48570,Julius Caesar,129.0,4.3.319,BRUTUS,Why comest thou?
48570,48571,Julius Caesar,130.0,4.3.320,GHOST,To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
48571,48572,Julius Caesar,131.0,4.3.321,BRUTUS,"Well, then I shall see thee again?"
48572,48573,Julius Caesar,132.0,4.3.322,GHOST,"Ay, at Philippi."
48573,48574,Julius Caesar,133.0,4.3.323,BRUTUS,"Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then."
48574,48575,Julius Caesar,133.0,,BRUTUS,Exit Ghost
48575,48576,Julius Caesar,133.0,4.3.324,BRUTUS,Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
48576,48577,Julius Caesar,133.0,4.3.325,BRUTUS,"Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee."
48577,48578,Julius Caesar,133.0,4.3.326,BRUTUS,"Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!"
48578,48579,Julius Caesar,134.0,4.3.327,LUCIUS,"The strings, my lord, are false."
48579,48580,Julius Caesar,135.0,4.3.328,BRUTUS,He thinks he still is at his instrument.
48580,48581,Julius Caesar,135.0,4.3.329,BRUTUS,"Lucius, awake!"
48581,48582,Julius Caesar,136.0,4.3.330,LUCIUS,My lord?
48582,48583,Julius Caesar,137.0,4.3.331,BRUTUS,"Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?"
48583,48584,Julius Caesar,138.0,4.3.332,LUCIUS,"My lord, I do not know that I did cry."
48584,48585,Julius Caesar,139.0,4.3.333,BRUTUS,"Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?"
48585,48586,Julius Caesar,140.0,4.3.334,LUCIUS,"Nothing, my lord."
48586,48587,Julius Caesar,141.0,4.3.335,BRUTUS,"Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!"
48587,48588,Julius Caesar,141.0,,BRUTUS,To VARRO
48588,48589,Julius Caesar,141.0,4.3.336,BRUTUS,"Fellow thou, awake!"
48589,48590,Julius Caesar,142.0,4.3.337,VARRO,My lord?
48590,48591,Julius Caesar,143.0,4.3.338,CLAUDIUS,My lord?
48591,48592,Julius Caesar,144.0,4.3.339,BRUTUS,"Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?"
48592,48593,Julius Caesar,146.0,4.3.340,CLAUDIUS,"Did we, my lord?"
48593,48594,Julius Caesar,147.0,4.3.341,BRUTUS,Ay: saw you any thing?
48594,48595,Julius Caesar,148.0,4.3.342,VARRO,"No, my lord, I saw nothing."
48595,48596,Julius Caesar,149.0,4.3.343,CLAUDIUS,"Nor I, my lord."
48596,48597,Julius Caesar,150.0,4.3.344,BRUTUS,"Go and commend me to my brother Cassius,"
48597,48598,Julius Caesar,150.0,4.3.345,BRUTUS,"Bid him set on his powers betimes before,"
48598,48599,Julius Caesar,150.0,4.3.346,BRUTUS,And we will follow.
48599,48600,Julius Caesar,152.0,4.3.347,CLAUDIUS,"It shall be done, my lord."
48600,48601,Julius Caesar,152.0,,CLAUDIUS,Exeunt
48601,48602,Julius Caesar,152.0,,CLAUDIUS,ACT V
48602,48603,Julius Caesar,152.0,,CLAUDIUS,SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.
48603,48604,Julius Caesar,152.0,,CLAUDIUS,"Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army"
48604,48605,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.1.1,OCTAVIUS,"Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:"
48605,48606,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.1.2,OCTAVIUS,"You said the enemy would not come down,"
48606,48607,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.1.3,OCTAVIUS,"But keep the hills and upper regions,"
48607,48608,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.1.4,OCTAVIUS,"It proves not so: their battles are at hand,"
48608,48609,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.1.5,OCTAVIUS,"They mean to warn us at Philippi here,"
48609,48610,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.1.6,OCTAVIUS,Answering before we do demand of them.
48610,48611,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.1.7,ANTONY,"Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know"
48611,48612,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.1.8,ANTONY,Wherefore they do it: they could be content
48612,48613,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.1.9,ANTONY,"To visit other places, and come down"
48613,48614,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.1.10,ANTONY,"With fearful bravery, thinking by this face"
48614,48615,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.1.11,ANTONY,"To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage,"
48615,48616,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.1.12,ANTONY,But 'tis not so.
48616,48617,Julius Caesar,2.0,,ANTONY,Enter a Messenger
48617,48618,Julius Caesar,3.0,5.1.13,Messenger,"Prepare you, generals:"
48618,48619,Julius Caesar,3.0,5.1.14,Messenger,"The enemy comes on in gallant show,"
48619,48620,Julius Caesar,3.0,5.1.15,Messenger,"Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,"
48620,48621,Julius Caesar,3.0,5.1.16,Messenger,And something to be done immediately.
48621,48622,Julius Caesar,4.0,5.1.17,ANTONY,"Octavius, lead your battle softly on,"
48622,48623,Julius Caesar,4.0,5.1.18,ANTONY,Upon the left hand of the even field.
48623,48624,Julius Caesar,5.0,5.1.19,OCTAVIUS,"Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left."
48624,48625,Julius Caesar,6.0,5.1.20,ANTONY,Why do you cross me in this exigent?
48625,48626,Julius Caesar,7.0,5.1.21,OCTAVIUS,"I do not cross you, but I will do so."
48626,48627,Julius Caesar,7.0,,OCTAVIUS,March
48627,48628,Julius Caesar,7.0,,OCTAVIUS,"Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army, LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others"
48628,48629,Julius Caesar,8.0,5.1.22,BRUTUS,"They stand, and would have parley."
48629,48630,Julius Caesar,9.0,5.1.23,CASSIUS,"Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk."
48630,48631,Julius Caesar,10.0,5.1.24,OCTAVIUS,"Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?"
48631,48632,Julius Caesar,11.0,5.1.25,ANTONY,"No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge."
48632,48633,Julius Caesar,11.0,5.1.26,ANTONY,"Make forth, the generals would have some words."
48633,48634,Julius Caesar,12.0,5.1.27,OCTAVIUS,Stir not until the signal.
48634,48635,Julius Caesar,13.0,5.1.28,BRUTUS,"Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?"
48635,48636,Julius Caesar,14.0,5.1.29,OCTAVIUS,"Not that we love words better, as you do."
48636,48637,Julius Caesar,15.0,5.1.30,BRUTUS,"Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius."
48637,48638,Julius Caesar,16.0,5.1.31,ANTONY,"In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:"
48638,48639,Julius Caesar,16.0,5.1.32,ANTONY,"Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,"
48639,48640,Julius Caesar,16.0,5.1.33,ANTONY,"Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'"
48640,48641,Julius Caesar,17.0,5.1.34,CASSIUS,"Antony,"
48641,48642,Julius Caesar,17.0,5.1.35,CASSIUS,"The posture of your blows are yet unknown,"
48642,48643,Julius Caesar,17.0,5.1.36,CASSIUS,"But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,"
48643,48644,Julius Caesar,17.0,5.1.37,CASSIUS,And leave them honeyless.
48644,48645,Julius Caesar,18.0,5.1.38,ANTONY,Not stingless too.
48645,48646,Julius Caesar,19.0,5.1.39,BRUTUS,"O, yes, and soundless too,"
48646,48647,Julius Caesar,19.0,5.1.40,BRUTUS,"For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,"
48647,48648,Julius Caesar,19.0,5.1.41,BRUTUS,And very wisely threat before you sting.
48648,48649,Julius Caesar,20.0,5.1.42,ANTONY,"Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers"
48649,48650,Julius Caesar,20.0,5.1.43,ANTONY,Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
48650,48651,Julius Caesar,20.0,5.1.44,ANTONY,"You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,"
48651,48652,Julius Caesar,20.0,5.1.45,ANTONY,"And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet,"
48652,48653,Julius Caesar,20.0,5.1.46,ANTONY,"Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind"
48653,48654,Julius Caesar,20.0,5.1.47,ANTONY,Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
48654,48655,Julius Caesar,21.0,5.1.48,CASSIUS,"Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:"
48655,48656,Julius Caesar,21.0,5.1.49,CASSIUS,"This tongue had not offended so to-day,"
48656,48657,Julius Caesar,21.0,5.1.50,CASSIUS,If Cassius might have ruled.
48657,48658,Julius Caesar,22.0,5.1.51,OCTAVIUS,"Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,"
48658,48659,Julius Caesar,22.0,5.1.52,OCTAVIUS,"The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look,"
48659,48660,Julius Caesar,22.0,5.1.53,OCTAVIUS,"I draw a sword against conspirators,"
48660,48661,Julius Caesar,22.0,5.1.54,OCTAVIUS,When think you that the sword goes up again?
48661,48662,Julius Caesar,22.0,5.1.55,OCTAVIUS,"Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds"

48665,48666,Julius Caesar,23.0,5.1.59,BRUTUS,Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
48666,48667,Julius Caesar,24.0,5.1.60,OCTAVIUS,"So I hope,"
48667,48668,Julius Caesar,24.0,5.1.61,OCTAVIUS,I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
48668,48669,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.1.62,BRUTUS,"O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,"
48669,48670,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.1.63,BRUTUS,"Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable."
48670,48671,Julius Caesar,26.0,5.1.64,CASSIUS,"A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,"

48675,48676,Julius Caesar,28.0,5.1.69,OCTAVIUS,"If you dare fight to-day, come to the field,"
48676,48677,Julius Caesar,28.0,5.1.70,OCTAVIUS,"If not, when you have stomachs."
48677,48678,Julius Caesar,28.0,,OCTAVIUS,"Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army"

48679,48680,Julius Caesar,29.0,5.1.72,CASSIUS,"The storm is up, and all is on the hazard."
48680,48681,Julius Caesar,30.0,5.1.73,BRUTUS,"Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you."

48686,48687,Julius Caesar,34.0,5.1.78,CASSIUS,"This is my birth-day, as this very day"
48687,48688,Julius Caesar,34.0,5.1.79,CASSIUS,"Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:"

48690,48691,Julius Caesar,34.0,5.1.82,CASSIUS,Upon one battle all our liberties.
48691,48692,Julius Caesar,34.0,5.1.83,CASSIUS,You know that I held Epicurus strong
48692,48693,Julius Caesar,34.0,5.1.84,CASSIUS,"And his opinion: now I change my mind,"
48693,48694,Julius Caesar,34.0,5.1.85,CASSIUS,And partly credit things that do presage.

48699,48700,Julius Caesar,34.0,5.1.91,CASSIUS,"And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,"

48714,48715,Julius Caesar,38.0,5.1.106,CASSIUS,"If we do lose this battle, then is this"
48715,48716,Julius Caesar,38.0,5.1.107,CASSIUS,The very last time we shall speak together:
48716,48717,Julius Caesar,38.0,5.1.108,CASSIUS,What are you then determined to do?
48717,48718,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.109,BRUTUS,Even by the rule of that philosophy
48718,48719,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.110,BRUTUS,By which I did blame Cato for the death
48719,48720,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.111,BRUTUS,"Which he did give himself, I know not how,"
48720,48721,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.112,BRUTUS,"But I do find it cowardly and vile,"
48721,48722,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.113,BRUTUS,"For fear of what might fall, so to prevent"
48722,48723,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.114,BRUTUS,The time of life: arming myself with patience
48723,48724,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.115,BRUTUS,To stay the providence of some high powers
48724,48725,Julius Caesar,39.0,5.1.116,BRUTUS,That govern us below.

48726,48727,Julius Caesar,40.0,5.1.118,CASSIUS,You are contented to be led in triumph
48727,48728,Julius Caesar,40.0,5.1.119,CASSIUS,Thorough the streets of Rome?
48728,48729,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.120,BRUTUS,"No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,"
48729,48730,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.121,BRUTUS,"That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome,"
48730,48731,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.122,BRUTUS,He bears too great a mind. But this same day
48731,48732,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.123,BRUTUS,"Must end that work the ides of March begun,"
48732,48733,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.124,BRUTUS,And whether we shall meet again I know not.
48733,48734,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.125,BRUTUS,Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
48734,48735,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.126,BRUTUS,"For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!"
48735,48736,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.127,BRUTUS,"If we do meet again, why, we shall smile,"
48736,48737,Julius Caesar,41.0,5.1.128,BRUTUS,"If not, why then, this parting was well made."
48737,48738,Julius Caesar,42.0,5.1.129,CASSIUS,"For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!"
48738,48739,Julius Caesar,42.0,5.1.130,CASSIUS,"If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed,"
48739,48740,Julius Caesar,42.0,5.1.131,CASSIUS,"If not, 'tis true this parting was well made."
48740,48741,Julius Caesar,43.0,5.1.132,BRUTUS,"Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know"
48741,48742,Julius Caesar,43.0,5.1.133,BRUTUS,The end of this day's business ere it come!
48742,48743,Julius Caesar,43.0,5.1.134,BRUTUS,"But it sufficeth that the day will end,"
48743,48744,Julius Caesar,43.0,5.1.135,BRUTUS,"And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!"

48752,48753,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.2.5,BRUTUS,And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
48753,48754,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.2.6,BRUTUS,"Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down."

48760,48761,Julius Caesar,1.0,5.3.4,CASSIUS,"I slew the coward, and did take it from him."
48761,48762,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.3.5,TITINIUS,"O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,"
48762,48763,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.3.6,TITINIUS,"Who, having some advantage on Octavius,"
48763,48764,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.3.7,TITINIUS,"Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,"
48764,48765,Julius Caesar,2.0,5.3.8,TITINIUS,Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
48765,48766,Julius Caesar,2.0,,TITINIUS,Enter PINDARUS

48821,48822,Julius Caesar,14.0,5.3.56,MESSALA,As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
48822,48823,Julius Caesar,15.0,5.3.57,TITINIUS,These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
48823,48824,Julius Caesar,16.0,5.3.58,MESSALA,Where did you leave him?

48826,48827,Julius Caesar,18.0,5.3.61,MESSALA,Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?
48827,48828,Julius Caesar,19.0,5.3.62,TITINIUS,He lies not like the living. O my heart!

48853,48854,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.87,TITINIUS,Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
48854,48855,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.88,TITINIUS,"Put on my brows this wreath of victory,"
48855,48856,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.89,TITINIUS,And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
48856,48857,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.90,TITINIUS,"Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!"
48857,48858,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.91,TITINIUS,"But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow,"
48858,48859,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.92,TITINIUS,"Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I"
48859,48860,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.93,TITINIUS,"Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,"
48860,48861,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.94,TITINIUS,And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
48861,48862,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.95,TITINIUS,"By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part"
48862,48863,Julius Caesar,25.0,5.3.96,TITINIUS,"Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart."
48863,48864,Julius Caesar,25.0,,TITINIUS,Kills himself

48876,48877,Julius Caesar,32.0,5.3.107,BRUTUS,"The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!"
48877,48878,Julius Caesar,32.0,5.3.108,BRUTUS,It is impossible that ever Rome
48878,48879,Julius Caesar,32.0,5.3.109,BRUTUS,"Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears"

93809,93810,Timon of Athens,4.0,1.1.4,Painter,"It wears, sir, as it grows."
93810,93811,Timon of Athens,5.0,1.1.5,Poet,"Ay, that's well known:"
93811,93812,Timon of Athens,5.0,1.1.6,Poet,"But what particular rarity? what strange,"
93812,93813,Timon of Athens,5.0,1.1.7,Poet,"Which manifold record not matches? See,"
93813,93814,Timon of Athens,5.0,1.1.8,Poet,Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
93814,93815,Timon of Athens,5.0,1.1.9,Poet,Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
93815,93816,Timon of Athens,6.0,1.1.10,Painter,"I know them both, th' other's a jeweller."
93816,93817,Timon of Athens,7.0,1.1.11,Merchant,"O, 'tis a worthy lord."
93817,93818,Timon of Athens,8.0,1.1.12,Jeweller,"Nay, that's most fix'd."
93818,93819,Timon of Athens,9.0,1.1.13,Merchant,"A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,"
93819,93820,Timon of Athens,9.0,1.1.14,Merchant,To an untirable and continuate goodness:
93820,93821,Timon of Athens,9.0,1.1.15,Merchant,He passes.
93821,93822,Timon of Athens,9.0,1.1.16,Merchant,Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--
93822,93823,Timon of Athens,10.0,1.1.17,Merchant,"O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?"
93823,93824,Timon of Athens,10.0,1.1.18,Merchant,"Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--"
93824,93825,Timon of Athens,11.0,1.1.19,Poet,[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have
93825,93826,Timon of Athens,11.0,1.1.20,Poet,"praised the vile,"
93826,93827,Timon of Athens,11.0,1.1.21,Poet,It stains the glory in that happy verse
93827,93828,Timon of Athens,11.0,1.1.22,Poet,Which aptly sings the good.'
93828,93829,Timon of Athens,12.0,1.1.23,Merchant,'Tis a good form.

93830,93831,Timon of Athens,13.0,1.1.24,Jeweller,"And rich: here is a water, look ye."
93831,93832,Timon of Athens,14.0,1.1.25,Painter,"You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication"
93832,93833,Timon of Athens,14.0,1.1.26,Painter,To the great lord.
93833,93834,Timon of Athens,15.0,1.1.27,Poet,A thing slipp'd idly from me.
93834,93835,Timon of Athens,15.0,1.1.28,Poet,"Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes"
93835,93836,Timon of Athens,15.0,1.1.29,Poet,From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
93836,93837,Timon of Athens,15.0,1.1.30,Poet,"Shows not till it be struck, our gentle flame"
93837,93838,Timon of Athens,15.0,1.1.31,Poet,Provokes itself and like the current flies
93838,93839,Timon of Athens,15.0,1.1.32,Poet,Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
93839,93840,Timon of Athens,16.0,1.1.33,Painter,"A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?"

93844,93845,Timon of Athens,20.0,1.1.38,Painter,Indifferent.
93845,93846,Timon of Athens,21.0,1.1.39,Poet,Admirable: how this grace
93846,93847,Timon of Athens,21.0,1.1.40,Poet,Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
93847,93848,Timon of Athens,21.0,1.1.41,Poet,This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
93848,93849,Timon of Athens,21.0,1.1.42,Poet,Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture

93850,93851,Timon of Athens,22.0,1.1.44,Painter,It is a pretty mocking of the life.
93851,93852,Timon of Athens,22.0,1.1.45,Painter,"Here is a touch, is't good?"
93852,93853,Timon of Athens,23.0,1.1.46,Poet,"I will say of it,"
93853,93854,Timon of Athens,23.0,1.1.47,Poet,It tutors nature: artificial strife
93854,93855,Timon of Athens,23.0,1.1.48,Poet,"Lives in these touches, livelier than life."
93855,93856,Timon of Athens,23.0,,Poet,"Enter certain Senators, and pass over"

93863,93864,Timon of Athens,27.0,1.1.56,Poet,With amplest entertainment: my free drift
93864,93865,Timon of Athens,27.0,1.1.57,Poet,"Halts not particularly, but moves itself"
93865,93866,Timon of Athens,27.0,1.1.58,Poet,In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice

93867,93868,Timon of Athens,27.0,1.1.60,Poet,"But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,"
93868,93869,Timon of Athens,27.0,1.1.61,Poet,Leaving no tract behind.
93869,93870,Timon of Athens,28.0,1.1.62,Painter,How shall I understand you?

93879,93880,Timon of Athens,29.0,1.1.72,Poet,Than to abhor himself: even he drops down

93881,93882,Timon of Athens,29.0,1.1.74,Poet,Most rich in Timon's nod.

93950,93951,Timon of Athens,50.0,1.1.140,Old Athenian,Than one which holds a trencher.

93987,93988,Timon of Athens,65.0,1.1.177,LUCILIUS,Which is not owed to you!

93991,93992,Timon of Athens,67.0,1.1.180,TIMON,"Go not away. What have you there, my friend?"
93992,93993,Timon of Athens,68.0,1.1.181,Painter,"A piece of painting, which I do beseech"
93993,93994,Timon of Athens,68.0,1.1.182,Painter,Your lordship to accept.
93994,93995,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.1.183,TIMON,Painting is welcome.
93995,93996,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.1.184,TIMON,"The painting is almost the natural man,"
93996,93997,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.1.185,TIMON,"or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,"
93997,93998,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.1.186,TIMON,He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
93998,93999,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.1.187,TIMON,"Even such as they give out. I like your work,"
93999,94000,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.1.188,TIMON,And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
94000,94001,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.1.189,TIMON,Till you hear further from me.
94001,94002,Timon of Athens,70.0,1.1.190,Painter,The gods preserve ye!
94002,94003,Timon of Athens,71.0,1.1.191,TIMON,"Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand,"
94003,94004,Timon of Athens,71.0,1.1.192,TIMON,"We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel"
94004,94005,Timon of Athens,71.0,1.1.193,TIMON,Hath suffer'd under praise.
94005,94006,Timon of Athens,72.0,1.1.194,Jeweller,"What, my lord! dispraise?"
94006,94007,Timon of Athens,73.0,1.1.195,TIMON,A more satiety of commendations.
94007,94008,Timon of Athens,73.0,1.1.196,TIMON,"If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,"
94008,94009,Timon of Athens,73.0,1.1.197,TIMON,It would unclew me quite.
94009,94010,Timon of Athens,74.0,1.1.198,Jeweller,"My lord, 'tis rated"
94010,94011,Timon of Athens,74.0,1.1.199,Jeweller,"As those which sell would give: but you well know,"
94011,94012,Timon of Athens,74.0,1.1.200,Jeweller,Things of like value differing in the owners
94012,94013,Timon of Athens,74.0,1.1.201,Jeweller,"Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,"
94013,94014,Timon of Athens,74.0,1.1.202,Jeweller,You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
94014,94015,Timon of Athens,75.0,1.1.203,TIMON,Well mock'd.
94015,94016,Timon of Athens,76.0,1.1.204,Merchant,"No, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue,"
94016,94017,Timon of Athens,76.0,1.1.205,Merchant,Which all men speak with him.
94017,94018,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.1.206,TIMON,"Look, who comes here: will you be chid?"
94018,94019,Timon of Athens,77.0,,TIMON,Enter APEMANTUS
94019,94020,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.1.207,TIMON,"Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship."
94020,94021,Timon of Athens,78.0,1.1.208,Merchant,He'll spare none.
94021,94022,Timon of Athens,79.0,1.1.209,TIMON,"Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!"
94022,94023,Timon of Athens,80.0,1.1.210,APEMANTUS,"Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow,"
94023,94024,Timon of Athens,80.0,1.1.211,APEMANTUS,"When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest."
94024,94025,Timon of Athens,81.0,1.1.212,TIMON,Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
94025,94026,Timon of Athens,82.0,1.1.213,APEMANTUS,Are they not Athenians?
94026,94027,Timon of Athens,83.0,1.1.214,TIMON,Yes.
94027,94028,Timon of Athens,84.0,1.1.215,APEMANTUS,Then I repent not.
94028,94029,Timon of Athens,84.0,1.1.216,APEMANTUS,"Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?"
94029,94030,Timon of Athens,85.0,1.1.217,APEMANTUS,Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
94030,94031,Timon of Athens,86.0,1.1.218,TIMON,"Thou art proud, Apemantus."
94031,94032,Timon of Athens,87.0,1.1.219,APEMANTUS,Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
94032,94033,Timon of Athens,88.0,1.1.220,TIMON,Whither art going?
94033,94034,Timon of Athens,89.0,1.1.221,APEMANTUS,To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
94034,94035,Timon of Athens,90.0,1.1.222,TIMON,That's a deed thou'lt die for.
94035,94036,Timon of Athens,91.0,1.1.223,APEMANTUS,"Right, if doing nothing be death by the law."
94036,94037,Timon of Athens,92.0,1.1.224,TIMON,"How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?"
94037,94038,Timon of Athens,93.0,1.1.225,APEMANTUS,"The best, for the innocence."
94038,94039,Timon of Athens,94.0,1.1.226,TIMON,Wrought he not well that painted it?
94039,94040,Timon of Athens,95.0,1.1.227,APEMANTUS,"He wrought better that made the painter, and yet"
94040,94041,Timon of Athens,95.0,1.1.228,APEMANTUS,he's but a filthy piece of work.
94041,94042,Timon of Athens,96.0,1.1.229,Painter,You're a dog.
94042,94043,Timon of Athens,97.0,1.1.230,APEMANTUS,"Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?"
94043,94044,Timon of Athens,98.0,1.1.231,TIMON,"Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?"
94044,94045,Timon of Athens,99.0,1.1.232,APEMANTUS,"No, I eat not lords."
94045,94046,Timon of Athens,100.0,1.1.233,TIMON,"An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies."
94046,94047,Timon of Athens,101.0,1.1.234,APEMANTUS,"O, they eat lords, so they come by great bellies."
94047,94048,Timon of Athens,102.0,1.1.235,TIMON,That's a lascivious apprehension.
94048,94049,Timon of Athens,103.0,1.1.236,APEMANTUS,So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
94049,94050,Timon of Athens,104.0,1.1.237,TIMON,"How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?"
94050,94051,Timon of Athens,105.0,1.1.238,APEMANTUS,"Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a"
94051,94052,Timon of Athens,105.0,1.1.239,APEMANTUS,man a doit.
94052,94053,Timon of Athens,106.0,1.1.240,TIMON,What dost thou think 'tis worth?
94053,94054,Timon of Athens,107.0,1.1.241,APEMANTUS,"Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!"
94054,94055,Timon of Athens,108.0,1.1.242,Poet,"How now, philosopher!"
94055,94056,Timon of Athens,109.0,1.1.243,APEMANTUS,Thou liest.
94056,94057,Timon of Athens,110.0,1.1.244,Poet,Art not one?
94057,94058,Timon of Athens,111.0,1.1.245,APEMANTUS,Yes.
94058,94059,Timon of Athens,112.0,1.1.246,Poet,Then I lie not.
94059,94060,Timon of Athens,113.0,1.1.247,APEMANTUS,Art not a poet?
94060,94061,Timon of Athens,114.0,1.1.248,Poet,Yes.
94061,94062,Timon of Athens,115.0,1.1.249,APEMANTUS,"Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou"
94062,94063,Timon of Athens,115.0,1.1.250,APEMANTUS,hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
94063,94064,Timon of Athens,116.0,1.1.251,Poet,"That's not feigned, he is so."
94064,94065,Timon of Athens,117.0,1.1.252,APEMANTUS,"Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy"
94065,94066,Timon of Athens,117.0,1.1.253,APEMANTUS,labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
94066,94067,Timon of Athens,117.0,1.1.254,APEMANTUS,"the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!"
94067,94068,Timon of Athens,118.0,1.1.255,TIMON,"What wouldst do then, Apemantus?"
94068,94069,Timon of Athens,119.0,1.1.256,APEMANTUS,"E'en as Apemantus does now, hate a lord with my heart."
94069,94070,Timon of Athens,120.0,1.1.257,TIMON,"What, thyself?"
94070,94071,Timon of Athens,121.0,1.1.258,APEMANTUS,Ay.
94071,94072,Timon of Athens,122.0,1.1.259,TIMON,Wherefore?
94072,94073,Timon of Athens,123.0,1.1.260,APEMANTUS,That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
94073,94074,Timon of Athens,123.0,1.1.261,APEMANTUS,Art not thou a merchant?
94074,94075,Timon of Athens,124.0,1.1.262,Merchant,"Ay, Apemantus."
94075,94076,Timon of Athens,125.0,1.1.263,APEMANTUS,"Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!"
94076,94077,Timon of Athens,126.0,1.1.264,Merchant,"If traffic do it, the gods do it."
94077,94078,Timon of Athens,127.0,1.1.265,APEMANTUS,"Traffic's thy god, and thy god confound thee!"
94078,94079,Timon of Athens,127.0,,APEMANTUS,Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger
94079,94080,Timon of Athens,128.0,1.1.266,TIMON,What trumpet's that?

94093,94094,Timon of Athens,131.0,1.1.278,APEMANTUS,And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
94094,94095,Timon of Athens,131.0,1.1.279,APEMANTUS,Into baboon and monkey.
94095,94096,Timon of Athens,132.0,1.1.280,ALCIBIADES,"Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed"

94104,94105,Timon of Athens,136.0,1.1.287,First Lord,That time serves still.

94106,94107,Timon of Athens,138.0,1.1.289,Second Lord,Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
94107,94108,Timon of Athens,139.0,1.1.290,APEMANTUS,"Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools."
94108,94109,Timon of Athens,140.0,1.1.291,Second Lord,"Fare thee well, fare thee well."
94109,94110,Timon of Athens,141.0,1.1.292,APEMANTUS,Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.

94124,94125,Timon of Athens,149.0,1.1.306,Second Lord,"Sevenfold above itself, no gift to him,"
94125,94126,Timon of Athens,149.0,1.1.307,Second Lord,But breeds the giver a return exceeding
94126,94127,Timon of Athens,149.0,1.1.308,Second Lord,All use of quittance.
94127,94128,Timon of Athens,150.0,1.1.309,First Lord,The noblest mind he carries

94138,94139,Timon of Athens,1.0,1.2.5,VENTIDIUS,"Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound"

94140,94141,Timon of Athens,1.0,1.2.7,VENTIDIUS,"Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help"
94141,94142,Timon of Athens,1.0,1.2.8,VENTIDIUS,I derived liberty.
94142,94143,Timon of Athens,2.0,1.2.9,TIMON,"O, by no means,"
94143,94144,Timon of Athens,2.0,1.2.10,TIMON,"Honest Ventidius, you mistake my love:"

94178,94179,Timon of Athens,12.0,1.2.43,APEMANTUS,"to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood,"

94180,94181,Timon of Athens,12.0,1.2.45,APEMANTUS,I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:

94236,94237,Timon of Athens,22.0,1.2.100,TIMON,"myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We"
94237,94238,Timon of Athens,22.0,1.2.101,TIMON,are born to do benefits: and what better or

94336,94337,Timon of Athens,58.0,1.2.188,TIMON,"I shall accept them fairly, let the presents"
94337,94338,Timon of Athens,58.0,1.2.189,TIMON,Be worthily entertain'd.

94342,94343,Timon of Athens,59.0,1.2.193,Third Servant,"to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour"
94343,94344,Timon of Athens,59.0,1.2.194,Third Servant,two brace of greyhounds.
94344,94345,Timon of Athens,60.0,1.2.195,TIMON,"I'll hunt with him, and let them be received,"
94345,94346,Timon of Athens,60.0,1.2.196,TIMON,Not without fair reward.
94346,94347,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.197,FLAVIUS,[Aside]                What will this come to?
94347,94348,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.198,FLAVIUS,"He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,"
94348,94349,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.199,FLAVIUS,And all out of an empty coffer:
94349,94350,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.200,FLAVIUS,"Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,"
94350,94351,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.201,FLAVIUS,"To show him what a beggar his heart is,"
94351,94352,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.202,FLAVIUS,Being of no power to make his wishes good:
94352,94353,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.203,FLAVIUS,His promises fly so beyond his state
94353,94354,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.204,FLAVIUS,"That what he speaks is all in debt, he owes"
94354,94355,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.205,FLAVIUS,For every word: he is so kind that he now
94355,94356,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.206,FLAVIUS,"Pays interest for 't, his land's put to their books."
94356,94357,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.207,FLAVIUS,"Well, would I were gently put out of office"
94357,94358,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.208,FLAVIUS,Before I were forced out!
94358,94359,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.209,FLAVIUS,Happier is he that has no friend to feed
94359,94360,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.210,FLAVIUS,Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
94360,94361,Timon of Athens,61.0,1.2.211,FLAVIUS,I bleed inwardly for my lord.
94361,94362,Timon of Athens,61.0,,FLAVIUS,Exit

94364,94365,Timon of Athens,62.0,1.2.214,TIMON,"Here, my lord, a trifle of our love."
94365,94366,Timon of Athens,63.0,1.2.215,Second Lord,With more than common thanks I will receive it.
94366,94367,Timon of Athens,64.0,1.2.216,Third Lord,"O, he's the very soul of bounty!"
94367,94368,Timon of Athens,65.0,1.2.217,TIMON,"And now I remember, my lord, you gave"
94368,94369,Timon of Athens,65.0,1.2.218,TIMON,Good words the other day of a bay courser
94369,94370,Timon of Athens,65.0,1.2.219,TIMON,"I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it."
94370,94371,Timon of Athens,66.0,1.2.220,Second Lord,"O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that."

94372,94373,Timon of Athens,67.0,1.2.222,TIMON,Can justly praise but what he does affect:

94374,94375,Timon of Athens,67.0,1.2.224,TIMON,I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.

94377,94378,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.2.227,TIMON,"So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give,"
94378,94379,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.2.228,TIMON,"Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,"
94379,94380,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.2.229,TIMON,"And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,"
94380,94381,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.2.230,TIMON,"Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich,"
94381,94382,Timon of Athens,69.0,1.2.231,TIMON,It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living

94385,94386,Timon of Athens,71.0,1.2.235,First Lord,We are so virtuously bound--
94386,94387,Timon of Athens,72.0,1.2.236,TIMON,And so
94387,94388,Timon of Athens,72.0,1.2.237,TIMON,Am I to you.
94388,94389,Timon of Athens,73.0,1.2.238,Second Lord,So infinitely endear'd--

94392,94393,Timon of Athens,76.0,1.2.242,TIMON,Ready for his friends.

94394,94395,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.2.243,APEMANTUS,What a coil's here!
94395,94396,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.2.244,APEMANTUS,Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
94396,94397,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.2.245,APEMANTUS,I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
94397,94398,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.2.246,APEMANTUS,That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
94398,94399,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.2.247,APEMANTUS,"Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,"
94399,94400,Timon of Athens,77.0,1.2.248,APEMANTUS,Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.
94400,94401,Timon of Athens,78.0,1.2.249,TIMON,"Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be"
94401,94402,Timon of Athens,78.0,1.2.250,TIMON,good to thee.
94402,94403,Timon of Athens,79.0,1.2.251,APEMANTUS,"No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,"
94403,94404,Timon of Athens,79.0,1.2.252,APEMANTUS,"there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then"
94404,94405,Timon of Athens,79.0,1.2.253,APEMANTUS,"thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,"
94405,94406,Timon of Athens,79.0,1.2.254,APEMANTUS,"Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in"
94406,94407,Timon of Athens,79.0,1.2.255,APEMANTUS,"paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and"
94407,94408,Timon of Athens,79.0,1.2.256,APEMANTUS,vain-glories?
94408,94409,Timon of Athens,80.0,1.2.257,TIMON,"Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am"
94409,94410,Timon of Athens,80.0,1.2.258,TIMON,"sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell, and come"
94410,94411,Timon of Athens,80.0,1.2.259,TIMON,with better music.

94415,94416,Timon of Athens,81.0,1.2.263,APEMANTUS,"O, that men's ears should be"
94416,94417,Timon of Athens,81.0,1.2.264,APEMANTUS,"To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!"

94423,94424,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.3,Senator,Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
94424,94425,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.4,Senator,"Of raging waste? It cannot hold, it will not."
94425,94426,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.5,Senator,"If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,"
94426,94427,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.6,Senator,"And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold."
94427,94428,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.7,Senator,"If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more"
94428,94429,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.8,Senator,"Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,"
94429,94430,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.9,Senator,"Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,"
94430,94431,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.10,Senator,"And able horses. No porter at his gate,"
94431,94432,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.11,Senator,But rather one that smiles and still invites
94432,94433,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.12,Senator,All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
94433,94434,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.13,Senator,"Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!"
94434,94435,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.1.14,Senator,"Caphis, I say!"

94442,94443,Timon of Athens,3.0,2.1.21,Senator,"My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn"

94446,94447,Timon of Athens,3.0,2.1.25,Senator,"But must not break my back to heal his finger,"

94451,94452,Timon of Athens,3.0,2.1.30,Senator,"A visage of demand, for, I do fear,"
94452,94453,Timon of Athens,3.0,2.1.31,Senator,"When every feather sticks in his own wing,"
94453,94454,Timon of Athens,3.0,2.1.32,Senator,"Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,"
94454,94455,Timon of Athens,3.0,2.1.33,Senator,Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.
94455,94456,Timon of Athens,4.0,2.1.34,CAPHIS,"I go, sir."
94456,94457,Timon of Athens,5.0,2.1.35,Senator,"'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,"

94465,94466,Timon of Athens,1.0,2.2.3,FLAVIUS,Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account

94691,94692,Timon of Athens,78.0,2.2.215,FLAVIUS,"To them to use your signet and your name,"
94692,94693,Timon of Athens,78.0,2.2.216,FLAVIUS,"But they do shake their heads, and I am here"
94693,94694,Timon of Athens,78.0,2.2.217,FLAVIUS,No richer in return.
94694,94695,Timon of Athens,79.0,2.2.218,TIMON,Is't true? can't be?
94695,94696,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.219,FLAVIUS,"They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,"
94696,94697,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.220,FLAVIUS,"That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot"
94697,94698,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.221,FLAVIUS,"Do what they would, are sorry--you are honourable,--"
94698,94699,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.222,FLAVIUS,But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
94699,94700,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.223,FLAVIUS,Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
94700,94701,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.224,FLAVIUS,"May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity,--"
94701,94702,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.225,FLAVIUS,"And so, intending other serious matters,"
94702,94703,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.226,FLAVIUS,"After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,"
94703,94704,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.227,FLAVIUS,With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
94704,94705,Timon of Athens,80.0,2.2.228,FLAVIUS,They froze me into silence.
94705,94706,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.229,TIMON,"You gods, reward them!"
94706,94707,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.230,TIMON,"Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows"
94707,94708,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.231,TIMON,Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
94708,94709,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.232,TIMON,"Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows,"
94709,94710,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.233,TIMON,"'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind,"
94710,94711,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.234,TIMON,"And nature, as it grows again toward earth,"
94711,94712,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.235,TIMON,"Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy."

94717,94718,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.239,TIMON,No blame belongs to thee.

94722,94723,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.243,TIMON,"Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,"
94723,94724,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.244,TIMON,"I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me,"

94731,94732,Timon of Athens,81.0,2.2.250,TIMON,That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
94732,94733,Timon of Athens,82.0,2.2.251,FLAVIUS,I would I could not think it: that thought is
94733,94734,Timon of Athens,82.0,2.2.252,FLAVIUS,"bounty's foe,"
94734,94735,Timon of Athens,82.0,2.2.253,FLAVIUS,"Being free itself, it thinks all others so."

94763,94764,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.1.23,LUCULLUS,keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'

94814,94815,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.2.5,First Stranger,which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
94815,94816,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.2.6,First Stranger,"happy hours are done and past, and his estate"
94816,94817,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.2.7,First Stranger,shrinks from him.
94817,94818,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.2.8,LUCILIUS,"Fie, no, do not believe it, he cannot want for money."
94818,94819,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.2.9,Second Stranger,"But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,"
94819,94820,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.2.10,Second Stranger,one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
94820,94821,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.2.11,Second Stranger,"so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and"
94821,94822,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.2.12,Second Stranger,"showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied."
94822,94823,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.2.13,LUCILIUS,How!

94825,94826,Timon of Athens,7.0,3.2.16,LUCILIUS,I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
94826,94827,Timon of Athens,7.0,3.2.17,LUCILIUS,there was very little honour showed in't. For my own

94829,94830,Timon of Athens,7.0,3.2.20,LUCILIUS,"and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his,"
94830,94831,Timon of Athens,7.0,3.2.21,LUCILIUS,"yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should"

94845,94846,Timon of Athens,12.0,3.2.34,SERVILIUS,with so many talents.
94846,94847,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.2.35,LUCILIUS,"I know his lordship is but merry with me,"
94847,94848,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.2.36,LUCILIUS,He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
94848,94849,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.2.37,SERVILIUS,"But in the mean time he wants less, my lord."

94850,94851,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.2.39,SERVILIUS,I should not urge it half so faithfully.

94852,94853,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.2.41,SERVILIUS,"Upon my soul,'tis true, sir."
94853,94854,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.2.42,LUCILIUS,What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself

94868,94869,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.2.57,LUCILIUS,"befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?"
94869,94870,Timon of Athens,18.0,3.2.58,SERVILIUS,"Yes, sir, I shall."
94870,94871,Timon of Athens,19.0,3.2.59,LUCILIUS,"I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius."
94871,94872,Timon of Athens,19.0,,LUCILIUS,Exit SERVILIUS
94872,94873,Timon of Athens,19.0,3.2.60,LUCILIUS,"True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,"
94873,94874,Timon of Athens,19.0,3.2.61,LUCILIUS,And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
94874,94875,Timon of Athens,19.0,,LUCILIUS,Exit
94875,94876,Timon of Athens,20.0,3.2.62,First Stranger,"Do you observe this, Hostilius?"
94876,94877,Timon of Athens,21.0,3.2.63,Second Stranger,"Ay, too well."
94877,94878,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.64,First Stranger,"Why, this is the world's soul, and just of the"
94878,94879,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.65,First Stranger,same piece
94879,94880,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.66,First Stranger,Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
94880,94881,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.67,First Stranger,"His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in"
94881,94882,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.68,First Stranger,"My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,"
94882,94883,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.69,First Stranger,"And kept his credit with his purse,"
94883,94884,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.70,First Stranger,"Supported his estate, nay, Timon's money"
94884,94885,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.71,First Stranger,"Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,"
94885,94886,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.72,First Stranger,"But Timon's silver treads upon his lip,"
94886,94887,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.73,First Stranger,"And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man"
94887,94888,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.74,First Stranger,When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
94888,94889,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.75,First Stranger,"He does deny him, in respect of his,"
94889,94890,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.2.76,First Stranger,What charitable men afford to beggars.
94890,94891,Timon of Athens,23.0,3.2.77,Third Stranger,Religion groans at it.
94891,94892,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.78,First Stranger,"For mine own part,"
94892,94893,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.79,First Stranger,"I never tasted Timon in my life,"
94893,94894,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.80,First Stranger,"Nor came any of his bounties over me,"
94894,94895,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.81,First Stranger,"To mark me for his friend, yet, I protest,"
94895,94896,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.82,First Stranger,"For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue"
94896,94897,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.83,First Stranger,"And honourable carriage,"
94897,94898,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.84,First Stranger,"Had his necessity made use of me,"
94898,94899,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.85,First Stranger,"I would have put my wealth into donation,"
94899,94900,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.86,First Stranger,"And the best half should have return'd to him,"
94900,94901,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.87,First Stranger,"So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,"
94901,94902,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.88,First Stranger,"Men must learn now with pity to dispense,"
94902,94903,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.2.89,First Stranger,For policy sits above conscience.
94903,94904,Timon of Athens,24.0,,First Stranger,Exeunt

94907,94908,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.3.2,SEMPRONIUS,all others?
94908,94909,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.3.3,SEMPRONIUS,"He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus,"
94909,94910,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.3.4,SEMPRONIUS,"And now Ventidius is wealthy too,"
94910,94911,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.3.5,SEMPRONIUS,Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
94911,94912,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.3.6,SEMPRONIUS,Owe their estates unto him.
94912,94913,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.3.7,Servant,"My lord,"
94913,94914,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.3.8,Servant,"They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for"
94914,94915,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.3.9,Servant,They have au denied him.
94915,94916,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.10,SEMPRONIUS,How! have they denied him?
94916,94917,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.11,SEMPRONIUS,Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
94917,94918,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.12,SEMPRONIUS,And does he send to me? Three? hum!
94918,94919,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.13,SEMPRONIUS,It shows but little love or judgment in him:
94919,94920,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.14,SEMPRONIUS,"Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like"
94920,94921,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.15,SEMPRONIUS,"physicians,"
94921,94922,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.16,SEMPRONIUS,"Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?"
94922,94923,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.17,SEMPRONIUS,"Has much disgraced me in't, I'm angry at him,"
94923,94924,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.18,SEMPRONIUS,"That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,"
94924,94925,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.19,SEMPRONIUS,"But his occasion might have woo'd me first,"
94925,94926,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.20,SEMPRONIUS,"For, in my conscience, I was the first man"
94926,94927,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.21,SEMPRONIUS,That e'er received gift from him:
94927,94928,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.22,SEMPRONIUS,"And does he think so backwardly of me now,"
94928,94929,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.23,SEMPRONIUS,That I'll requite its last? No:
94929,94930,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.24,SEMPRONIUS,So it may prove an argument of laughter
94930,94931,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.25,SEMPRONIUS,"To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool."
94931,94932,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.26,SEMPRONIUS,"I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,"
94932,94933,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.27,SEMPRONIUS,"Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake,"
94933,94934,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.28,SEMPRONIUS,"I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,"
94934,94935,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.29,SEMPRONIUS,"And with their faint reply this answer join,"
94935,94936,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.3.30,SEMPRONIUS,Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
94936,94937,Timon of Athens,3.0,,SEMPRONIUS,Exit
94937,94938,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.31,Servant,Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
94938,94939,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.32,Servant,devil knew not what he did when he made man
94939,94940,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.33,Servant,"politic, he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot"
94940,94941,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.34,Servant,"think but, in the end, the villainies of man will"
94941,94942,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.35,Servant,set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
94942,94943,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.36,Servant,"appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,"
94943,94944,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.37,Servant,like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
94944,94945,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.38,Servant,whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
94945,94946,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.39,Servant,politic love.
94946,94947,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.40,Servant,"This was my lord's best hope, now all are fled,"
94947,94948,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.41,Servant,"Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,"
94948,94949,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.42,Servant,"Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards"
94949,94950,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.43,Servant,Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
94950,94951,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.44,Servant,Now to guard sure their master.
94951,94952,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.45,Servant,"And this is all a liberal course allows,"
94952,94953,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.3.46,Servant,Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
94953,94954,Timon of Athens,4.0,,Servant,Exit
94954,94955,Timon of Athens,4.0,,Servant,SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.
94955,94956,Timon of Athens,4.0,,Servant,"Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of  LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out"
94956,94957,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.4.1,Servant,Varro's
94957,94958,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.4.2,First Servant,"Well met, good morrow, Titus and Hortensius."
94958,94959,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.4.3,TITUS,The like to you kind Varro.
94959,94960,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.4.4,HORTENSIUS,Lucius!
94960,94961,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.4.5,HORTENSIUS,"What, do we meet together?"
94961,94962,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.4.6,HORTENSIUS,"Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I think"
94962,94963,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.4.7,HORTENSIUS,"One business does command us all, for mine Is money."
94963,94964,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.4.8,TITUS,So is theirs and ours.
94964,94965,Timon of Athens,4.0,,TITUS,Enter PHILOTUS
94965,94966,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.4.9,TITUS,Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!
94966,94967,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.4.10,PHILOTUS,Good day at once.
94967,94968,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.4.11,PHILOTUS,"Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother."
94968,94969,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.4.12,PHILOTUS,What do you think the hour?
94969,94970,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.4.13,PHILOTUS,Labouring for nine.
94970,94971,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.4.14,PHILOTUS,Lucilius' Servant	So much?
94971,94972,Timon of Athens,7.0,3.4.15,PHILOTUS,Is not my lord seen yet?
94972,94973,Timon of Athens,7.0,3.4.16,PHILOTUS,Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.
94973,94974,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.4.17,PHILOTUS,"I wonder on't, he was wont to shine at seven."
94974,94975,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.4.18,PHILOTUS,"Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:"
94975,94976,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.4.19,PHILOTUS,You must consider that a prodigal course
94976,94977,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.4.20,PHILOTUS,"Is like the sun's, but not, like his, recoverable."
94977,94978,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.4.21,PHILOTUS,"I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse,"
94978,94979,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.4.22,PHILOTUS,"That is one may reach deep enough, and yet"
94979,94980,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.4.23,PHILOTUS,Find little.
94980,94981,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.4.24,PHILOTUS,I am of your fear for that.
94981,94982,Timon of Athens,10.0,3.4.25,TITUS,I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
94982,94983,Timon of Athens,10.0,3.4.26,TITUS,Your lord sends now for money.
94983,94984,Timon of Athens,11.0,3.4.27,HORTENSIUS,"Most true, he does."
94984,94985,Timon of Athens,12.0,3.4.28,TITUS,"And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,"
94985,94986,Timon of Athens,12.0,3.4.29,TITUS,For which I wait for money.
94986,94987,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.4.30,HORTENSIUS,It is against my heart.
94987,94988,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.4.31,HORTENSIUS,"Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,"
94988,94989,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.4.32,HORTENSIUS,Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
94989,94990,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.4.33,HORTENSIUS,"And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,"
94990,94991,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.4.34,HORTENSIUS,And send for money for 'em.
94991,94992,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.4.35,HORTENSIUS,"I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:"
94992,94993,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.4.36,HORTENSIUS,"I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,"
94993,94994,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.4.37,HORTENSIUS,And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
94994,94995,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.4.38,HORTENSIUS,Varro's
94995,94996,Timon of Athens,15.0,3.4.39,First Servant,"Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?"
94996,94997,Timon of Athens,15.0,3.4.40,First Servant,Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.
94997,94998,Timon of Athens,15.0,3.4.41,First Servant,Varro's
94998,94999,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.4.42,First Servant,"'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,"
94999,95000,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.4.43,First Servant,"Your master's confidence was above mine,"
95000,95001,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.4.44,First Servant,"Else, surely, his had equall'd."
95001,95002,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.4.45,First Servant,Enter FLAMINIUS.
95002,95003,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.4.46,TITUS,One of Lord Timon's men.
95003,95004,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.4.47,TITUS,"Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to"
95004,95005,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.4.48,TITUS,come forth?
95005,95006,Timon of Athens,18.0,3.4.49,FLAMINIUS,"No, indeed, he is not."
95006,95007,Timon of Athens,19.0,3.4.50,TITUS,"We attend his lordship, pray, signify so much."
95007,95008,Timon of Athens,20.0,3.4.51,FLAMINIUS,"I need not tell him that, he knows you are too diligent."
95008,95009,Timon of Athens,20.0,,FLAMINIUS,Exit
95009,95010,Timon of Athens,20.0,,FLAMINIUS,"Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled"
95010,95011,Timon of Athens,20.0,3.4.52,FLAMINIUS,Lucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
95011,95012,Timon of Athens,20.0,3.4.53,FLAMINIUS,"He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him."
95012,95013,Timon of Athens,21.0,3.4.54,TITUS,"Do you hear, sir?"
95013,95014,Timon of Athens,21.0,3.4.55,TITUS,Varro's
95014,95015,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.4.56,Second Servant,"By your leave, sir,--"
95015,95016,Timon of Athens,23.0,3.4.57,FLAVIUS,"What do ye ask of me, my friend?"
95016,95017,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.4.58,TITUS,"We wait for certain money here, sir."
95017,95018,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.59,FLAVIUS,"Ay,"
95018,95019,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.60,FLAVIUS,"If money were as certain as your waiting,"
95019,95020,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.61,FLAVIUS,'Twere sure enough.
95020,95021,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.62,FLAVIUS,"Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,"
95021,95022,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.63,FLAVIUS,When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
95022,95023,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.64,FLAVIUS,Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
95023,95024,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.65,FLAVIUS,And take down the interest into their
95024,95025,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.66,FLAVIUS,gluttonous maws.
95025,95026,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.67,FLAVIUS,"You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up,"
95026,95027,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.68,FLAVIUS,Let me pass quietly:
95027,95028,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.69,FLAVIUS,"Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end,"
95028,95029,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.70,FLAVIUS,"I have no more to reckon, he to spend."
95029,95030,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.4.71,FLAVIUS,"Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve."
95030,95031,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.4.72,FLAVIUS,"If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you,"
95031,95032,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.4.73,FLAVIUS,For you serve knaves.
95032,95033,Timon of Athens,26.0,,FLAVIUS,Exit
95033,95034,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.4.74,FLAVIUS,Varro's
95034,95035,Timon of Athens,27.0,3.4.75,First Servant,How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
95035,95036,Timon of Athens,27.0,3.4.76,First Servant,Varro's
95036,95037,Timon of Athens,28.0,3.4.77,Second Servant,"No matter what, he's poor, and that's revenge"
95037,95038,Timon of Athens,28.0,3.4.78,Second Servant,enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
95038,95039,Timon of Athens,28.0,3.4.79,Second Servant,house to put his head in? such may rail against
95039,95040,Timon of Athens,28.0,3.4.80,Second Servant,great buildings.
95040,95041,Timon of Athens,28.0,,Second Servant,Enter SERVILIUS
95041,95042,Timon of Athens,29.0,3.4.81,TITUS,"O, here's Servilius, now we shall know some answer."
95042,95043,Timon of Athens,30.0,3.4.82,SERVILIUS,"If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some"

95047,95048,Timon of Athens,30.0,3.4.87,SERVILIUS,Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
95048,95049,Timon of Athens,30.0,3.4.88,SERVILIUS,"And, if it be so far beyond his health,"
95049,95050,Timon of Athens,30.0,3.4.89,SERVILIUS,"Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,"
95050,95051,Timon of Athens,30.0,3.4.90,SERVILIUS,And make a clear way to the gods.
95051,95052,Timon of Athens,31.0,3.4.91,SERVILIUS,Good gods!

95057,95058,Timon of Athens,34.0,3.4.96,TIMON,"Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?"

95059,95060,Timon of Athens,34.0,3.4.98,TIMON,"Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?"
95060,95061,Timon of Athens,34.0,3.4.99,TIMON,"Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus."

95102,95103,Timon of Athens,55.0,3.4.138,TIMON,"I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide"

95107,95108,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.5.2,First Senator,"Bloody, 'tis necessary he should die:"
95108,95109,Timon of Athens,1.0,3.5.3,First Senator,Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
95109,95110,Timon of Athens,2.0,3.5.4,Second Senator,"Most true, the law shall bruise him."
95110,95111,Timon of Athens,2.0,,Second Senator,"Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants"
95111,95112,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.5.5,ALCIBIADES,"Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!"
95112,95113,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.5.6,First Senator,"Now, captain?"
95113,95114,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.7,ALCIBIADES,"I am an humble suitor to your virtues,"
95114,95115,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.8,ALCIBIADES,"For pity is the virtue of the law,"
95115,95116,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.9,ALCIBIADES,And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
95116,95117,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.10,ALCIBIADES,It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
95117,95118,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.11,ALCIBIADES,"Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,"
95118,95119,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.12,ALCIBIADES,"Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth"
95119,95120,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.13,ALCIBIADES,"To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't."
95120,95121,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.14,ALCIBIADES,"He is a man, setting his fate aside,"
95121,95122,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.15,ALCIBIADES,Of comely virtues:
95122,95123,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.16,ALCIBIADES,Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
95123,95124,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.17,ALCIBIADES,An honour in him which buys out his fault--
95124,95125,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.18,ALCIBIADES,"But with a noble fury and fair spirit,"
95125,95126,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.19,ALCIBIADES,"Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,"
95126,95127,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.20,ALCIBIADES,He did oppose his foe:
95127,95128,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.21,ALCIBIADES,And with such sober and unnoted passion
95128,95129,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.22,ALCIBIADES,"He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,"
95129,95130,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.5.23,ALCIBIADES,As if he had but proved an argument.
95130,95131,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.24,First Senator,"You undergo too strict a paradox,"
95131,95132,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.25,First Senator,Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
95132,95133,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.26,First Senator,Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
95133,95134,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.27,First Senator,To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
95134,95135,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.28,First Senator,"Upon the head of valour, which indeed"
95135,95136,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.29,First Senator,Is valour misbegot and came into the world
95136,95137,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.30,First Senator,When sects and factions were newly born:
95137,95138,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.31,First Senator,He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
95138,95139,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.32,First Senator,"The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs"
95139,95140,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.33,First Senator,"His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,"
95140,95141,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.34,First Senator,"carelessly,"
95141,95142,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.35,First Senator,"And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,"
95142,95143,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.36,First Senator,To bring it into danger.
95143,95144,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.37,First Senator,"If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,"
95144,95145,Timon of Athens,6.0,3.5.38,First Senator,What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
95145,95146,Timon of Athens,7.0,3.5.39,ALCIBIADES,"My lord,--"
95146,95147,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.5.40,First Senator,You cannot make gross sins look clear:
95147,95148,Timon of Athens,8.0,3.5.41,First Senator,"To revenge is no valour, but to bear."
95148,95149,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.42,ALCIBIADES,"My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,"
95149,95150,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.43,ALCIBIADES,If I speak like a captain.
95150,95151,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.44,ALCIBIADES,"Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,"
95151,95152,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.45,ALCIBIADES,"And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,"
95152,95153,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.46,ALCIBIADES,"And let the foes quietly cut their throats,"
95153,95154,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.47,ALCIBIADES,Without repugnancy? If there be
95154,95155,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.48,ALCIBIADES,"Such valour in the bearing, what make we"
95155,95156,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.49,ALCIBIADES,"Abroad? why then, women are more valiant"
95156,95157,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.50,ALCIBIADES,"That stay at home, if bearing carry it,"
95157,95158,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.51,ALCIBIADES,"And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon"
95158,95159,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.52,ALCIBIADES,"Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,"
95159,95160,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.53,ALCIBIADES,"If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,"
95160,95161,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.54,ALCIBIADES,"As you are great, be pitifully good:"
95161,95162,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.55,ALCIBIADES,Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
95162,95163,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.56,ALCIBIADES,"To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust,"
95163,95164,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.57,ALCIBIADES,"But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just."
95164,95165,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.58,ALCIBIADES,"To be in anger is impiety,"
95165,95166,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.59,ALCIBIADES,But who is man that is not angry?
95166,95167,Timon of Athens,9.0,3.5.60,ALCIBIADES,Weigh but the crime with this.
95167,95168,Timon of Athens,10.0,3.5.61,Second Senator,You breathe in vain.
95168,95169,Timon of Athens,11.0,3.5.62,ALCIBIADES,In vain! his service done
95169,95170,Timon of Athens,11.0,3.5.63,ALCIBIADES,At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
95170,95171,Timon of Athens,11.0,3.5.64,ALCIBIADES,Were a sufficient briber for his life.
95171,95172,Timon of Athens,12.0,3.5.65,First Senator,What's that?
95172,95173,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.5.66,ALCIBIADES,"I say, my lords, he has done fair service,"
95173,95174,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.5.67,ALCIBIADES,And slain in fight many of your enemies:
95174,95175,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.5.68,ALCIBIADES,How full of valour did he bear himself
95175,95176,Timon of Athens,13.0,3.5.69,ALCIBIADES,"In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!"
95176,95177,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.70,Second Senator,"He has made too much plenty with 'em,"
95177,95178,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.71,Second Senator,He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
95178,95179,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.72,Second Senator,"Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:"
95179,95180,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.73,Second Senator,"If there were no foes, that were enough"
95180,95181,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.74,Second Senator,To overcome him: in that beastly fury
95181,95182,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.75,Second Senator,"He has been known to commit outrages,"
95182,95183,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.76,Second Senator,"And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,"
95183,95184,Timon of Athens,14.0,3.5.77,Second Senator,His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
95184,95185,Timon of Athens,15.0,3.5.78,First Senator,He dies.
95185,95186,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.79,ALCIBIADES,Hard fate! he might have died in war.
95186,95187,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.80,ALCIBIADES,"My lords, if not for any parts in him--"
95187,95188,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.81,ALCIBIADES,Though his right arm might purchase his own time
95188,95189,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.82,ALCIBIADES,"And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,"
95189,95190,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.83,ALCIBIADES,"Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:"
95190,95191,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.84,ALCIBIADES,"And, for I know your reverend ages love"
95191,95192,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.85,ALCIBIADES,"Security, I'll pawn my victories, all"
95192,95193,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.86,ALCIBIADES,"My honours to you, upon his good returns."
95193,95194,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.87,ALCIBIADES,"If by this crime he owes the law his life,"
95194,95195,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.88,ALCIBIADES,"Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore"
95195,95196,Timon of Athens,16.0,3.5.89,ALCIBIADES,"For law is strict, and war is nothing more."
95196,95197,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.5.90,First Senator,"We are for law: he dies, urge it no more,"
95197,95198,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.5.91,First Senator,"On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,"
95198,95199,Timon of Athens,17.0,3.5.92,First Senator,He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
95199,95200,Timon of Athens,18.0,3.5.93,ALCIBIADES,"Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,"
95200,95201,Timon of Athens,18.0,3.5.94,ALCIBIADES,"I do beseech you, know me."
95201,95202,Timon of Athens,19.0,3.5.95,Second Senator,How!
95202,95203,Timon of Athens,20.0,3.5.96,ALCIBIADES,Call me to your remembrances.
95203,95204,Timon of Athens,21.0,3.5.97,Third Senator,What!
95204,95205,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.5.98,ALCIBIADES,"I cannot think but your age has forgot me,"
95205,95206,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.5.99,ALCIBIADES,"It could not else be, I should prove so base,"
95206,95207,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.5.100,ALCIBIADES,"To sue, and be denied such common grace:"
95207,95208,Timon of Athens,22.0,3.5.101,ALCIBIADES,My wounds ache at you.
95208,95209,Timon of Athens,23.0,3.5.102,First Senator,Do you dare our anger?
95209,95210,Timon of Athens,23.0,3.5.103,First Senator,"'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect,"
95210,95211,Timon of Athens,23.0,3.5.104,First Senator,We banish thee for ever.
95211,95212,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.5.105,ALCIBIADES,Banish me!
95212,95213,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.5.106,ALCIBIADES,"Banish your dotage, banish usury,"
95213,95214,Timon of Athens,24.0,3.5.107,ALCIBIADES,That makes the senate ugly.
95214,95215,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.5.108,First Senator,"If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,"
95215,95216,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.5.109,First Senator,"Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell"
95216,95217,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.5.110,First Senator,"our spirit,"
95217,95218,Timon of Athens,25.0,3.5.111,First Senator,He shall be executed presently.
95218,95219,Timon of Athens,25.0,,First Senator,Exeunt Senators
95219,95220,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.5.112,ALCIBIADES,"Now the gods keep you old enough, that you may live"
95220,95221,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.5.113,ALCIBIADES,"Only in bone, that none may look on you!"
95221,95222,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.5.114,ALCIBIADES,"I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,"
95222,95223,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.5.115,ALCIBIADES,While they have told their money and let out
95223,95224,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.5.116,ALCIBIADES,"Their coin upon large interest, I myself"
95224,95225,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.5.117,ALCIBIADES,Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?

95229,95230,Timon of Athens,26.0,3.5.122,ALCIBIADES,That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up

95240,95241,Timon of Athens,3.0,3.6.5,First Lord,encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as

95242,95243,Timon of Athens,4.0,3.6.7,Second Lord,"It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting."
95243,95244,Timon of Athens,5.0,3.6.8,First Lord,I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest

95934,95935,Timon of Athens,142.0,4.3.457,TIMON,Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?

95936,95937,Timon of Athens,143.0,4.3.459,First Bandit,As beasts and birds and fishes.
95937,95938,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.460,TIMON,"Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes,"
95938,95939,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.461,TIMON,You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
95939,95940,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.462,TIMON,"That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not"
95940,95941,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.463,TIMON,In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
95941,95942,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.464,TIMON,"In limited professions. Rascal thieves,"
95942,95943,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.465,TIMON,"Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,"
95943,95944,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.466,TIMON,"Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,"
95944,95945,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.467,TIMON,"And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician,"
95945,95946,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.468,TIMON,"His antidotes are poison, and he slays"
95946,95947,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.469,TIMON,"Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together,"

95948,95949,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.471,TIMON,Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
95949,95950,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.472,TIMON,"The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction"
95950,95951,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.473,TIMON,"Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,"
95951,95952,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.474,TIMON,And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
95952,95953,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.475,TIMON,"The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves"
95953,95954,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.476,TIMON,"The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,"
95954,95955,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.477,TIMON,That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
95955,95956,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.478,TIMON,From general excrement: each thing's a thief:

95960,95961,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.483,TIMON,"Break open shops, nothing can you steal,"
95961,95962,Timon of Athens,144.0,4.3.484,TIMON,But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this

95964,95965,Timon of Athens,145.0,4.3.487,Third Bandit,persuading me to it.
95965,95966,Timon of Athens,146.0,4.3.488,First Bandit,'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
95966,95967,Timon of Athens,146.0,4.3.489,First Bandit,"us, not to have us thrive in our mystery."
95967,95968,Timon of Athens,147.0,4.3.490,Second Bandit,"I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade."
95968,95969,Timon of Athens,148.0,4.3.491,First Bandit,Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
95969,95970,Timon of Athens,148.0,4.3.492,First Bandit,so miserable but a man may be true.
95970,95971,Timon of Athens,148.0,,First Bandit,Exeunt Banditti
95971,95972,Timon of Athens,148.0,,First Bandit,Enter FLAVIUS

95973,95974,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.494,FLAVIUS,Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
95974,95975,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.495,FLAVIUS,Full of decay and failing? O monument
95975,95976,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.496,FLAVIUS,And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
95976,95977,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.497,FLAVIUS,What an alteration of honour
95977,95978,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.498,FLAVIUS,Has desperate want made!
95978,95979,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.499,FLAVIUS,What viler thing upon the earth than friends
95979,95980,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.500,FLAVIUS,Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
95980,95981,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.501,FLAVIUS,"How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,"
95981,95982,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.502,FLAVIUS,When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
95982,95983,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.503,FLAVIUS,"Grant I may ever love, and rather woo"
95983,95984,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.504,FLAVIUS,Those that would mischief me than those that do!
95984,95985,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.505,FLAVIUS,Has caught me in his eye: I will present
95985,95986,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.506,FLAVIUS,"My honest grief unto him, and, as my lord,"
95986,95987,Timon of Athens,149.0,4.3.507,FLAVIUS,Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
95987,95988,Timon of Athens,150.0,4.3.508,TIMON,Away! what art thou?
95988,95989,Timon of Athens,151.0,4.3.509,FLAVIUS,"Have you forgot me, sir?"
95989,95990,Timon of Athens,152.0,4.3.510,TIMON,"Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men,"
95990,95991,Timon of Athens,152.0,4.3.511,TIMON,"Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee."
95991,95992,Timon of Athens,153.0,4.3.512,FLAVIUS,An honest poor servant of yours.
95992,95993,Timon of Athens,154.0,4.3.513,TIMON,Then I know thee not:
95993,95994,Timon of Athens,154.0,4.3.514,TIMON,"I never had honest man about me, I, all"
95994,95995,Timon of Athens,154.0,4.3.515,TIMON,"I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains."
95995,95996,Timon of Athens,155.0,4.3.516,FLAVIUS,"The gods are witness,"
95996,95997,Timon of Athens,155.0,4.3.517,FLAVIUS,Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief

95998,95999,Timon of Athens,156.0,4.3.519,TIMON,"What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I"
95999,96000,Timon of Athens,156.0,4.3.520,TIMON,"love thee,"
96000,96001,Timon of Athens,156.0,4.3.521,TIMON,"Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st"
96001,96002,Timon of Athens,156.0,4.3.522,TIMON,"Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give"
96002,96003,Timon of Athens,156.0,4.3.523,TIMON,But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
96003,96004,Timon of Athens,156.0,4.3.524,TIMON,"Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!"
96004,96005,Timon of Athens,157.0,4.3.525,FLAVIUS,"I beg of you to know me, good my lord,"
96005,96006,Timon of Athens,157.0,4.3.526,FLAVIUS,To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
96006,96007,Timon of Athens,157.0,4.3.527,FLAVIUS,To entertain me as your steward still.
96007,96008,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.528,TIMON,Had I a steward
96008,96009,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.529,TIMON,"So true, so just, and now so comfortable?"
96009,96010,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.530,TIMON,It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
96010,96011,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.531,TIMON,"Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man"
96011,96012,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.532,TIMON,Was born of woman.
96012,96013,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.533,TIMON,"Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,"
96013,96014,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.534,TIMON,You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
96014,96015,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.535,TIMON,"One honest man--mistake me not--but one,"
96015,96016,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.536,TIMON,"No more, I pray,--and he's a steward."
96016,96017,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.537,TIMON,How fain would I have hated all mankind!
96017,96018,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.538,TIMON,"And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,"
96018,96019,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.539,TIMON,I fell with curses.
96019,96020,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.540,TIMON,"Methinks thou art more honest now than wise,"
96020,96021,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.541,TIMON,"For, by oppressing and betraying me,"
96021,96022,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.542,TIMON,Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
96022,96023,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.543,TIMON,"For many so arrive at second masters,"
96023,96024,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.544,TIMON,Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
96024,96025,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.545,TIMON,"For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--"
96025,96026,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.546,TIMON,"Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,"
96026,96027,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.547,TIMON,"If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,"
96027,96028,Timon of Athens,158.0,4.3.548,TIMON,Expecting in return twenty for one?
96028,96029,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.549,FLAVIUS,"No, my most worthy master, in whose breast"
96029,96030,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.550,FLAVIUS,"Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:"
96030,96031,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.551,FLAVIUS,You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
96031,96032,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.552,FLAVIUS,Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
96032,96033,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.553,FLAVIUS,"That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,"
96033,96034,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.554,FLAVIUS,"Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,"
96034,96035,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.555,FLAVIUS,"Care of your food and living, and, believe it,"
96035,96036,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.556,FLAVIUS,"My most honour'd lord,"
96036,96037,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.557,FLAVIUS,"For any benefit that points to me,"
96037,96038,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.558,FLAVIUS,"Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange"
96038,96039,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.559,FLAVIUS,"For this one wish, that you had power and wealth"
96039,96040,Timon of Athens,159.0,4.3.560,FLAVIUS,"To requite me, by making rich yourself."
96040,96041,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.561,TIMON,"Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,"
96041,96042,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.562,TIMON,"Here, take: the gods out of my misery"
96042,96043,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.563,TIMON,"Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,"
96043,96044,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.564,TIMON,"But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men,"
96044,96045,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.565,TIMON,"Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,"
96045,96046,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.566,TIMON,"But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,"
96046,96047,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.567,TIMON,"Ere thou relieve the beggar, give to dogs"
96047,96048,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.568,TIMON,"What thou deny'st to men, let prisons swallow 'em,"
96048,96049,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.569,TIMON,"Debts wither 'em to nothing, be men like"

96050,96051,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.571,TIMON,And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
96051,96052,Timon of Athens,160.0,4.3.572,TIMON,And so farewell and thrive.
96052,96053,Timon of Athens,161.0,4.3.573,FLAVIUS,"O, let me stay,"
96053,96054,Timon of Athens,161.0,4.3.574,FLAVIUS,"And comfort you, my master."
96054,96055,Timon of Athens,162.0,4.3.575,TIMON,"If thou hatest curses,"

96059,96060,Timon of Athens,162.0,,TIMON,SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.
96060,96061,Timon of Athens,162.0,,TIMON,"Enter Poet and Painter, TIMON watching them from his cave"
96061,96062,Timon of Athens,1.0,5.1.1,Painter,"As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where"
96062,96063,Timon of Athens,1.0,5.1.2,Painter,he abides.
96063,96064,Timon of Athens,2.0,5.1.3,Poet,What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
96064,96065,Timon of Athens,2.0,5.1.4,Poet,"for true, that he's so full of gold?"
96065,96066,Timon of Athens,3.0,5.1.5,Painter,"Certain: Alcibiades reports it, Phrynia and"
96066,96067,Timon of Athens,3.0,5.1.6,Painter,Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
96067,96068,Timon of Athens,3.0,5.1.7,Painter,straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
96068,96069,Timon of Athens,3.0,5.1.8,Painter,he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
96069,96070,Timon of Athens,4.0,5.1.9,Poet,Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
96070,96071,Timon of Athens,5.0,5.1.10,Painter,Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
96071,96072,Timon of Athens,5.0,5.1.11,Painter,"again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore"
96072,96073,Timon of Athens,5.0,5.1.12,Painter,"'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this"
96073,96074,Timon of Athens,5.0,5.1.13,Painter,supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
96074,96075,Timon of Athens,5.0,5.1.14,Painter,"us, and is very likely to load our purposes with"
96075,96076,Timon of Athens,5.0,5.1.15,Painter,"what they travail for, if it be a just true report"
96076,96077,Timon of Athens,5.0,5.1.16,Painter,that goes of his having.
96077,96078,Timon of Athens,6.0,5.1.17,Poet,What have you now to present unto him?
96078,96079,Timon of Athens,7.0,5.1.18,Painter,Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
96079,96080,Timon of Athens,7.0,5.1.19,Painter,promise him an excellent piece.
96080,96081,Timon of Athens,8.0,5.1.20,Poet,"I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent"
96081,96082,Timon of Athens,8.0,5.1.21,Poet,that's coming toward him.
96082,96083,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.22,Painter,Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
96083,96084,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.23,Painter,time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
96084,96085,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.24,Painter,"performance is ever the duller for his act, and,"
96085,96086,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.25,Painter,"but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the"
96086,96087,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.26,Painter,deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
96087,96088,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.27,Painter,most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
96088,96089,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.28,Painter,of will or testament which argues a great sickness
96089,96090,Timon of Athens,9.0,5.1.29,Painter,in his judgment that makes it.
96090,96091,Timon of Athens,9.0,,Painter,"TIMON comes from his cave, behind"

96093,96094,Timon of Athens,11.0,5.1.32,Poet,I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
96094,96095,Timon of Athens,11.0,5.1.33,Poet,"him: it must be a personating of himself, a satire"
96095,96096,Timon of Athens,11.0,5.1.34,Poet,"against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery"
96096,96097,Timon of Athens,11.0,5.1.35,Poet,of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
96097,96098,Timon of Athens,12.0,5.1.36,TIMON,[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in
96098,96099,Timon of Athens,12.0,5.1.37,TIMON,thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
96099,96100,Timon of Athens,12.0,5.1.38,TIMON,"other men? Do so, I have gold for thee."

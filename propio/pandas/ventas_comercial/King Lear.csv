49030,49031,King Lear,1.0,1.1.1,KENT,I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
49031,49032,King Lear,1.0,1.1.2,KENT,Albany than Cornwall.
49032,49033,King Lear,2.0,1.1.3,GLOUCESTER,"It did always seem so to us: but now, in the"
49033,49034,King Lear,2.0,1.1.4,GLOUCESTER,"division of the kingdom, it appears not which of"
49034,49035,King Lear,2.0,1.1.5,GLOUCESTER,"the dukes he values most, for equalities are so"
49035,49036,King Lear,2.0,1.1.6,GLOUCESTER,"weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice"
49036,49037,King Lear,2.0,1.1.7,GLOUCESTER,of either's moiety.
49037,49038,King Lear,3.0,1.1.8,KENT,"Is not this your son, my lord?"
49038,49039,King Lear,4.0,1.1.9,GLOUCESTER,"His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have"
49039,49040,King Lear,4.0,1.1.10,GLOUCESTER,"so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am"
49040,49041,King Lear,4.0,1.1.11,GLOUCESTER,brazed to it.
49041,49042,King Lear,5.0,1.1.12,KENT,I cannot conceive you.
49042,49043,King Lear,6.0,1.1.13,GLOUCESTER,"Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon"
49043,49044,King Lear,6.0,1.1.14,GLOUCESTER,"she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son"
49044,49045,King Lear,6.0,1.1.15,GLOUCESTER,for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
49045,49046,King Lear,6.0,1.1.16,GLOUCESTER,Do you smell a fault?
49046,49047,King Lear,7.0,1.1.17,KENT,"I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it"
49047,49048,King Lear,7.0,1.1.18,KENT,being so proper.
49048,49049,King Lear,8.0,1.1.19,GLOUCESTER,"But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year"
49049,49050,King Lear,8.0,1.1.20,GLOUCESTER,"elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:"
49050,49051,King Lear,8.0,1.1.21,GLOUCESTER,though this knave came something saucily into the
49051,49052,King Lear,8.0,1.1.22,GLOUCESTER,"world before he was sent for, yet was his mother"
49052,49053,King Lear,8.0,1.1.23,GLOUCESTER,"fair, there was good sport at his making, and the"
49053,49054,King Lear,8.0,1.1.24,GLOUCESTER,whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
49054,49055,King Lear,8.0,1.1.25,GLOUCESTER,"noble gentleman, Edmund?"
49055,49056,King Lear,9.0,1.1.26,EDMUND,"No, my lord."
49056,49057,King Lear,10.0,1.1.27,GLOUCESTER,My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
49057,49058,King Lear,10.0,1.1.28,GLOUCESTER,honourable friend.
49058,49059,King Lear,11.0,1.1.29,EDMUND,My services to your lordship.
49059,49060,King Lear,12.0,1.1.30,KENT,"I must love you, and sue to know you better."
49060,49061,King Lear,13.0,1.1.31,EDMUND,"Sir, I shall study deserving."
49061,49062,King Lear,14.0,1.1.32,GLOUCESTER,"He hath been out nine years, and away he shall"
49062,49063,King Lear,14.0,1.1.33,GLOUCESTER,again. The king is coming.
49063,49064,King Lear,14.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants"
49064,49065,King Lear,15.0,1.1.34,KING LEAR,"Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester."
49065,49066,King Lear,16.0,1.1.35,GLOUCESTER,"I shall, my liege."
49066,49067,King Lear,16.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
49067,49068,King Lear,17.0,1.1.36,KING LEAR,Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
49068,49069,King Lear,17.0,1.1.37,KING LEAR,Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
49069,49070,King Lear,17.0,1.1.38,KING LEAR,In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
49070,49071,King Lear,17.0,1.1.39,KING LEAR,"To shake all cares and business from our age,"
49071,49072,King Lear,17.0,1.1.40,KING LEAR,"Conferring them on younger strengths, while we"
49072,49073,King Lear,17.0,1.1.41,KING LEAR,"Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,"
49073,49074,King Lear,17.0,1.1.42,KING LEAR,"And you, our no less loving son of Albany,"
49074,49075,King Lear,17.0,1.1.43,KING LEAR,We have this hour a constant will to publish
49075,49076,King Lear,17.0,1.1.44,KING LEAR,"Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife"
49076,49077,King Lear,17.0,1.1.45,KING LEAR,"May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,"
49077,49078,King Lear,17.0,1.1.46,KING LEAR,"Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,"
49078,49079,King Lear,17.0,1.1.47,KING LEAR,"Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,"
49079,49080,King Lear,17.0,1.1.48,KING LEAR,"And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--"
49080,49081,King Lear,17.0,1.1.49,KING LEAR,"Since now we will divest us both of rule,"
49081,49082,King Lear,17.0,1.1.50,KING LEAR,"Interest of territory, cares of state,--"
49082,49083,King Lear,17.0,1.1.51,KING LEAR,Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
49083,49084,King Lear,17.0,1.1.52,KING LEAR,That we our largest bounty may extend
49084,49085,King Lear,17.0,1.1.53,KING LEAR,"Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,"
49085,49086,King Lear,17.0,1.1.54,KING LEAR,"Our eldest-born, speak first."

49088,49089,King Lear,18.0,1.1.57,GONERIL,"Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,"
49089,49090,King Lear,18.0,1.1.58,GONERIL,"No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour,"
49090,49091,King Lear,18.0,1.1.59,GONERIL,"As much as child e'er loved, or father found,"
49091,49092,King Lear,18.0,1.1.60,GONERIL,"A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable,"
49092,49093,King Lear,18.0,1.1.61,GONERIL,Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
49093,49094,King Lear,19.0,1.1.62,CORDELIA,[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
49094,49095,King Lear,19.0,1.1.63,CORDELIA,"Love, and be silent."
49095,49096,King Lear,20.0,1.1.64,LEAR,"Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,"
49096,49097,King Lear,20.0,1.1.65,LEAR,"With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,"
49097,49098,King Lear,20.0,1.1.66,LEAR,"With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,"
49098,49099,King Lear,20.0,1.1.67,LEAR,We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
49099,49100,King Lear,20.0,1.1.68,LEAR,"Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,"

49101,49102,King Lear,21.0,1.1.70,REGAN,"Sir, I am made"
49102,49103,King Lear,21.0,1.1.71,REGAN,"Of the self-same metal that my sister is,"
49103,49104,King Lear,21.0,1.1.72,REGAN,And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
49104,49105,King Lear,21.0,1.1.73,REGAN,"I find she names my very deed of love,"
49105,49106,King Lear,21.0,1.1.74,REGAN,Only she comes too short: that I profess
49106,49107,King Lear,21.0,1.1.75,REGAN,"Myself an enemy to all other joys,"
49107,49108,King Lear,21.0,1.1.76,REGAN,"Which the most precious square of sense possesses,"
49108,49109,King Lear,21.0,1.1.77,REGAN,And find I am alone felicitate
49109,49110,King Lear,21.0,1.1.78,REGAN,In your dear highness' love.
49110,49111,King Lear,22.0,1.1.79,CORDELIA,[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!
49111,49112,King Lear,22.0,1.1.80,CORDELIA,"And yet not so, since, I am sure, my love's"
49112,49113,King Lear,22.0,1.1.81,CORDELIA,More richer than my tongue.
49113,49114,King Lear,23.0,1.1.82,KING LEAR,To thee and thine hereditary ever
49114,49115,King Lear,23.0,1.1.83,KING LEAR,"Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,"

49116,49117,King Lear,23.0,1.1.85,KING LEAR,"Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,"
49117,49118,King Lear,23.0,1.1.86,KING LEAR,"Although the last, not least, to whose young love"

49120,49121,King Lear,23.0,1.1.89,KING LEAR,A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

49122,49123,King Lear,25.0,1.1.91,KING LEAR,Nothing!
49123,49124,King Lear,26.0,1.1.92,CORDELIA,Nothing.

49128,49129,King Lear,29.0,1.1.97,KING LEAR,"How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,"
49129,49130,King Lear,29.0,1.1.98,KING LEAR,Lest it may mar your fortunes.
49130,49131,King Lear,30.0,1.1.99,CORDELIA,"Good my lord,"
49131,49132,King Lear,30.0,1.1.100,CORDELIA,"You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I"

49137,49138,King Lear,30.0,1.1.106,CORDELIA,"Half my love with him, half my care and duty:"
49138,49139,King Lear,30.0,1.1.107,CORDELIA,"Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,"
49139,49140,King Lear,30.0,1.1.108,CORDELIA,To love my father all.
49140,49141,King Lear,31.0,1.1.109,KING LEAR,But goes thy heart with this?
49141,49142,King Lear,32.0,1.1.110,CORDELIA,"Ay, good my lord."
49142,49143,King Lear,33.0,1.1.111,KING LEAR,"So young, and so untender?"

49266,49267,King Lear,60.0,1.1.228,KING LEAR,"To match you where I hate, therefore beseech you"
49267,49268,King Lear,60.0,1.1.229,KING LEAR,To avert your liking a more worthier way
49268,49269,King Lear,60.0,1.1.230,KING LEAR,Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
49269,49270,King Lear,60.0,1.1.231,KING LEAR,Almost to acknowledge hers.
49270,49271,King Lear,61.0,1.1.232,KING OF FRANCE,"This is most strange,"
49271,49272,King Lear,61.0,1.1.233,KING OF FRANCE,"That she, that even but now was your best object,"
49272,49273,King Lear,61.0,1.1.234,KING OF FRANCE,"The argument of your praise, balm of your age,"
49273,49274,King Lear,61.0,1.1.235,KING OF FRANCE,"Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time"

49275,49276,King Lear,61.0,1.1.237,KING OF FRANCE,"So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence"
49276,49277,King Lear,61.0,1.1.238,KING OF FRANCE,"Must be of such unnatural degree,"
49277,49278,King Lear,61.0,1.1.239,KING OF FRANCE,"That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection"
49278,49279,King Lear,61.0,1.1.240,KING OF FRANCE,"Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,"
49279,49280,King Lear,61.0,1.1.241,KING OF FRANCE,Must be a faith that reason without miracle
49280,49281,King Lear,61.0,1.1.242,KING OF FRANCE,Could never plant in me.
49281,49282,King Lear,62.0,1.1.243,CORDELIA,"I yet beseech your majesty,--"
49282,49283,King Lear,62.0,1.1.244,CORDELIA,"If for I want that glib and oily art,"
49283,49284,King Lear,62.0,1.1.245,CORDELIA,"To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,"
49284,49285,King Lear,62.0,1.1.246,CORDELIA,"I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known"

49286,49287,King Lear,62.0,1.1.248,CORDELIA,"No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,"
49287,49288,King Lear,62.0,1.1.249,CORDELIA,"That hath deprived me of your grace and favour,"
49288,49289,King Lear,62.0,1.1.250,CORDELIA,"But even for want of that for which I am richer,"
49289,49290,King Lear,62.0,1.1.251,CORDELIA,"A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue"
49290,49291,King Lear,62.0,1.1.252,CORDELIA,"As I am glad I have not, though not to have it"
49291,49292,King Lear,62.0,1.1.253,CORDELIA,Hath lost me in your liking.
49292,49293,King Lear,63.0,1.1.254,KING LEAR,Better thou
49293,49294,King Lear,63.0,1.1.255,KING LEAR,Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
49294,49295,King Lear,64.0,1.1.256,KING OF FRANCE,"Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature"
49295,49296,King Lear,64.0,1.1.257,KING OF FRANCE,Which often leaves the history unspoke
49296,49297,King Lear,64.0,1.1.258,KING OF FRANCE,"That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,"
49297,49298,King Lear,64.0,1.1.259,KING OF FRANCE,What say you to the lady? Love's not love
49298,49299,King Lear,64.0,1.1.260,KING OF FRANCE,When it is mingled with regards that stand
49299,49300,King Lear,64.0,1.1.261,KING OF FRANCE,Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
49300,49301,King Lear,64.0,1.1.262,KING OF FRANCE,She is herself a dowry.
49301,49302,King Lear,65.0,1.1.263,BURGUNDY,"Royal Lear,"
49302,49303,King Lear,65.0,1.1.264,BURGUNDY,"Give but that portion which yourself proposed,"
49303,49304,King Lear,65.0,1.1.265,BURGUNDY,"And here I take Cordelia by the hand,"
49304,49305,King Lear,65.0,1.1.266,BURGUNDY,Duchess of Burgundy.
49305,49306,King Lear,66.0,1.1.267,KING LEAR,"Nothing: I have sworn, I am firm."

49307,49308,King Lear,67.0,1.1.269,BURGUNDY,That you must lose a husband.
49308,49309,King Lear,68.0,1.1.270,CORDELIA,Peace be with Burgundy!
49309,49310,King Lear,68.0,1.1.271,CORDELIA,"Since that respects of fortune are his love,"
49310,49311,King Lear,68.0,1.1.272,CORDELIA,I shall not be his wife.
49311,49312,King Lear,69.0,1.1.273,KING OF FRANCE,"Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor,"
49312,49313,King Lear,69.0,1.1.274,KING OF FRANCE,"Most choice, forsaken, and most loved, despised!"
49313,49314,King Lear,69.0,1.1.275,KING OF FRANCE,Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
49314,49315,King Lear,69.0,1.1.276,KING OF FRANCE,Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
49315,49316,King Lear,69.0,1.1.277,KING OF FRANCE,"Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect"
49316,49317,King Lear,69.0,1.1.278,KING OF FRANCE,My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
49317,49318,King Lear,69.0,1.1.279,KING OF FRANCE,"Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,"
49318,49319,King Lear,69.0,1.1.280,KING OF FRANCE,"Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:"

49320,49321,King Lear,69.0,1.1.282,KING OF FRANCE,Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
49321,49322,King Lear,69.0,1.1.283,KING OF FRANCE,"Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:"
49322,49323,King Lear,69.0,1.1.284,KING OF FRANCE,"Thou losest here, a better where to find."
49323,49324,King Lear,70.0,1.1.285,KING LEAR,"Thou hast her, France: let her be thine, for we"

49325,49326,King Lear,70.0,1.1.287,KING LEAR,That face of hers again. Therefore be gone

49337,49338,King Lear,72.0,1.1.298,CORDELIA,"So, farewell to you both."

49355,49356,King Lear,79.0,1.1.315,GONERIL,with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
49356,49357,King Lear,79.0,1.1.316,GONERIL,appears too grossly.
49357,49358,King Lear,80.0,1.1.317,REGAN,'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever

49363,49364,King Lear,81.0,1.1.323,GONERIL,that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
49364,49365,King Lear,82.0,1.1.324,REGAN,Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
49365,49366,King Lear,82.0,1.1.325,REGAN,him as this of Kent's banishment.
49366,49367,King Lear,83.0,1.1.326,GONERIL,There is further compliment of leavetaking
49367,49368,King Lear,83.0,1.1.327,GONERIL,"between France and him. Pray you, let's hit"
49368,49369,King Lear,83.0,1.1.328,GONERIL,together: if our father carry authority with

50158,50159,King Lear,31.0,2.1.104,REGAN,"No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:"
50159,50160,King Lear,31.0,2.1.105,REGAN,"'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,"
50160,50161,King Lear,31.0,2.1.106,REGAN,To have the expense and waste of his revenues.

50308,50309,King Lear,47.0,2.2.107,KENT,"To go out of my dialect, which you"
50309,50310,King Lear,47.0,2.2.108,KENT,"discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no"

50315,50316,King Lear,49.0,2.2.114,OSWALD,I never gave him any:

50528,50529,King Lear,36.0,2.4.117,KING LEAR,To take the indisposed and sickly fit

50533,50534,King Lear,36.0,2.4.121,KING LEAR,Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
50534,50535,King Lear,36.0,2.4.122,KING LEAR,"Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,"
50535,50536,King Lear,36.0,2.4.123,KING LEAR,"Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,"

50552,50553,King Lear,43.0,2.4.137,KING LEAR,"I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,"
50553,50554,King Lear,43.0,2.4.138,KING LEAR,"I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,"
50554,50555,King Lear,43.0,2.4.139,KING LEAR,Sepulchring an adultress.

50564,50565,King Lear,44.0,2.4.147,REGAN,You less know how to value her desert
50565,50566,King Lear,44.0,2.4.148,REGAN,Than she to scant her duty.
50566,50567,King Lear,45.0,2.4.149,KING LEAR,"Say, how is that?"
50567,50568,King Lear,46.0,2.4.150,REGAN,I cannot think my sister in the least

50586,50587,King Lear,50.0,2.4.168,REGAN,"Good sir, no more, these are unsightly tricks:"
50587,50588,King Lear,50.0,2.4.169,REGAN,Return you to my sister.

50598,50599,King Lear,53.0,2.4.180,KING LEAR,"You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,"
50599,50600,King Lear,53.0,2.4.181,KING LEAR,To fall and blast her pride!
50600,50601,King Lear,54.0,2.4.182,REGAN,"O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,"
50601,50602,King Lear,54.0,2.4.183,REGAN,When the rash mood is on.
50602,50603,King Lear,55.0,2.4.184,KING LEAR,"No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:"
50603,50604,King Lear,55.0,2.4.185,KING LEAR,Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give

50635,50636,King Lear,63.0,2.4.213,GONERIL,"Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?"
50636,50637,King Lear,63.0,2.4.214,GONERIL,All's not offence that indiscretion finds
50637,50638,King Lear,63.0,2.4.215,GONERIL,And dotage terms so.
50638,50639,King Lear,64.0,2.4.216,KING LEAR,"O sides, you are too tough,"
50639,50640,King Lear,64.0,2.4.217,KING LEAR,Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?

50667,50668,King Lear,70.0,2.4.244,KING LEAR,"Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,"
50668,50669,King Lear,70.0,2.4.245,KING LEAR,"A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,"
50669,50670,King Lear,70.0,2.4.246,KING LEAR,"In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee,"
50670,50671,King Lear,70.0,2.4.247,KING LEAR,"Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:"

50672,50673,King Lear,70.0,2.4.249,KING LEAR,Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:

50678,50679,King Lear,71.0,2.4.255,REGAN,"For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,"
50679,50680,King Lear,71.0,2.4.256,REGAN,For those that mingle reason with your passion
50680,50681,King Lear,71.0,2.4.257,REGAN,"Must be content to think you old, and so--"
50681,50682,King Lear,71.0,2.4.258,REGAN,But she knows what she does.
50682,50683,King Lear,72.0,2.4.259,KING LEAR,Is this well spoken?
50683,50684,King Lear,73.0,2.4.260,REGAN,"I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?"
50684,50685,King Lear,73.0,2.4.261,REGAN,Is it not well? What should you need of more?
50685,50686,King Lear,73.0,2.4.262,REGAN,"Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger"
50686,50687,King Lear,73.0,2.4.263,REGAN,"Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,"
50687,50688,King Lear,73.0,2.4.264,REGAN,"Should many people, under two commands,"
50688,50689,King Lear,73.0,2.4.265,REGAN,"Hold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible."
50689,50690,King Lear,74.0,2.4.266,GONERIL,"Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance"
50690,50691,King Lear,74.0,2.4.267,GONERIL,From those that she calls servants or from mine?
50691,50692,King Lear,75.0,2.4.268,REGAN,"Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,"
50692,50693,King Lear,75.0,2.4.269,REGAN,"We could control them. If you will come to me,--"
50693,50694,King Lear,75.0,2.4.270,REGAN,"For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you"
50694,50695,King Lear,75.0,2.4.271,REGAN,To bring but five and twenty: to no more
50695,50696,King Lear,75.0,2.4.272,REGAN,Will I give place or notice.
50696,50697,King Lear,76.0,2.4.273,KING LEAR,I gave you all--
50697,50698,King Lear,77.0,2.4.274,REGAN,And in good time you gave it.
50698,50699,King Lear,78.0,2.4.275,KING LEAR,"Made you my guardians, my depositaries,"
50699,50700,King Lear,78.0,2.4.276,KING LEAR,But kept a reservation to be follow'd
50700,50701,King Lear,78.0,2.4.277,KING LEAR,"With such a number. What, must I come to you"
50701,50702,King Lear,78.0,2.4.278,KING LEAR,"With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?"
50702,50703,King Lear,79.0,2.4.279,REGAN,"And speak't again, my lord, no more with me."
50703,50704,King Lear,80.0,2.4.280,KING LEAR,"Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,"
50704,50705,King Lear,80.0,2.4.281,KING LEAR,When others are more wicked: not being the worst

50709,50710,King Lear,80.0,2.4.285,KING LEAR,And thou art twice her love.
50710,50711,King Lear,81.0,2.4.286,GONERIL,"Hear me, my lord,"
50711,50712,King Lear,81.0,2.4.287,GONERIL,"What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,"
50712,50713,King Lear,81.0,2.4.288,GONERIL,To follow in a house where twice so many
50713,50714,King Lear,81.0,2.4.289,GONERIL,Have a command to tend you?
50714,50715,King Lear,82.0,2.4.290,REGAN,What need one?
50715,50716,King Lear,83.0,2.4.291,KING LEAR,"O, reason not the need: our basest beggars"
50716,50717,King Lear,83.0,2.4.292,KING LEAR,Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
50717,50718,King Lear,83.0,2.4.293,KING LEAR,"Allow not nature more than nature needs,"
50718,50719,King Lear,83.0,2.4.294,KING LEAR,"Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady,"
50719,50720,King Lear,83.0,2.4.295,KING LEAR,"If only to go warm were gorgeous,"
50720,50721,King Lear,83.0,2.4.296,KING LEAR,"Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,"
50721,50722,King Lear,83.0,2.4.297,KING LEAR,"Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--"
50722,50723,King Lear,83.0,2.4.298,KING LEAR,"You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!"
50723,50724,King Lear,83.0,2.4.299,KING LEAR,"You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,"
50724,50725,King Lear,83.0,2.4.300,KING LEAR,"As full of grief as age, wretched in both!"
50725,50726,King Lear,83.0,2.4.301,KING LEAR,If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
50726,50727,King Lear,83.0,2.4.302,KING LEAR,"Against their father, fool me not so much"
50727,50728,King Lear,83.0,2.4.303,KING LEAR,"To bear it tamely, touch me with noble anger,"
50728,50729,King Lear,83.0,2.4.304,KING LEAR,"And let not women's weapons, water-drops,"
50729,50730,King Lear,83.0,2.4.305,KING LEAR,"Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,"
50730,50731,King Lear,83.0,2.4.306,KING LEAR,"I will have such revenges on you both,"
50731,50732,King Lear,83.0,2.4.307,KING LEAR,"That all the world shall--I will do such things,--"
50732,50733,King Lear,83.0,2.4.308,KING LEAR,"What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be"
50733,50734,King Lear,83.0,2.4.309,KING LEAR,The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
50734,50735,King Lear,83.0,2.4.310,KING LEAR,"No, I'll not weep:"
50735,50736,King Lear,83.0,2.4.311,KING LEAR,"I have full cause of weeping, but this heart"
50736,50737,King Lear,83.0,2.4.312,KING LEAR,"Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,"
50737,50738,King Lear,83.0,2.4.313,KING LEAR,"Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!"

50741,50742,King Lear,85.0,2.4.315,REGAN,This house is little: the old man and his people
50742,50743,King Lear,85.0,2.4.316,REGAN,Cannot be well bestow'd.
50743,50744,King Lear,86.0,2.4.317,GONERIL,"'Tis his own blame, hath put himself from rest,"
50744,50745,King Lear,86.0,2.4.318,GONERIL,And must needs taste his folly.
50745,50746,King Lear,87.0,2.4.319,REGAN,"For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,"
50746,50747,King Lear,87.0,2.4.320,REGAN,But not one follower.
50747,50748,King Lear,88.0,2.4.321,GONERIL,So am I purposed.
50748,50749,King Lear,88.0,2.4.322,GONERIL,Where is my lord of Gloucester?
50749,50750,King Lear,89.0,2.4.323,CORNWALL,Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
50750,50751,King Lear,89.0,,CORNWALL,Re-enter GLOUCESTER
50751,50752,King Lear,90.0,2.4.324,GLOUCESTER,The king is in high rage.
50752,50753,King Lear,91.0,2.4.325,CORNWALL,Whither is he going?
50753,50754,King Lear,92.0,2.4.326,GLOUCESTER,"He calls to horse, but will I know not whither."
50754,50755,King Lear,93.0,2.4.327,CORNWALL,"'Tis best to give him way, he leads himself."
50755,50756,King Lear,94.0,2.4.328,GONERIL,"My lord, entreat him by no means to stay."
50756,50757,King Lear,95.0,2.4.329,GLOUCESTER,"Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds"
50757,50758,King Lear,95.0,2.4.330,GLOUCESTER,"Do sorely ruffle, for many miles a bout"
50758,50759,King Lear,95.0,2.4.331,GLOUCESTER,There's scarce a bush.
50759,50760,King Lear,96.0,2.4.332,REGAN,"O, sir, to wilful men,"
50760,50761,King Lear,96.0,2.4.333,REGAN,The injuries that they themselves procure
50761,50762,King Lear,96.0,2.4.334,REGAN,Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
50762,50763,King Lear,96.0,2.4.335,REGAN,"He is attended with a desperate train,"
50763,50764,King Lear,96.0,2.4.336,REGAN,"And what they may incense him to, being apt"
50764,50765,King Lear,96.0,2.4.337,REGAN,"To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear."
50765,50766,King Lear,97.0,2.4.338,CORNWALL,"Shut up your doors, my lord, 'tis a wild night:"
50766,50767,King Lear,97.0,2.4.339,CORNWALL,"My Regan counsels well, come out o' the storm."

50771,50772,King Lear,1.0,3.1.1,KENT,"Who's there, besides foul weather?"
50772,50773,King Lear,2.0,3.1.2,Gentleman,"One minded like the weather, most unquietly."
50773,50774,King Lear,3.0,3.1.3,KENT,I know you. Where's the king?
50774,50775,King Lear,4.0,3.1.4,Gentleman,Contending with the fretful element:
50775,50776,King Lear,4.0,3.1.5,Gentleman,"Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,"
50776,50777,King Lear,4.0,3.1.6,Gentleman,"Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,"
50777,50778,King Lear,4.0,3.1.7,Gentleman,"That things might change or cease, tears his white hair,"
50778,50779,King Lear,4.0,3.1.8,Gentleman,"Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,"
50779,50780,King Lear,4.0,3.1.9,Gentleman,"Catch in their fury, and make nothing of,"
50780,50781,King Lear,4.0,3.1.10,Gentleman,Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
50781,50782,King Lear,4.0,3.1.11,Gentleman,The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
50782,50783,King Lear,4.0,3.1.12,Gentleman,"This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,"

50784,50785,King Lear,4.0,3.1.14,Gentleman,"Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,"
50785,50786,King Lear,4.0,3.1.15,Gentleman,And bids what will take all.
50786,50787,King Lear,5.0,3.1.16,KENT,But who is with him?
50787,50788,King Lear,6.0,3.1.17,Gentleman,"None but the fool, who labours to out-jest"
50788,50789,King Lear,6.0,3.1.18,Gentleman,His heart-struck injuries.
50789,50790,King Lear,7.0,3.1.19,KENT,"Sir, I do know you,"

50791,50792,King Lear,7.0,3.1.21,KENT,"Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,"
50792,50793,King Lear,7.0,3.1.22,KENT,Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
50793,50794,King Lear,7.0,3.1.23,KENT,"With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall,"
50794,50795,King Lear,7.0,3.1.24,KENT,"Who have--as who have not, that their great stars"
50795,50796,King Lear,7.0,3.1.25,KENT,"Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,"
50796,50797,King Lear,7.0,3.1.26,KENT,Which are to France the spies and speculations
50797,50798,King Lear,7.0,3.1.27,KENT,"Intelligent of our state, what hath been seen,"
50798,50799,King Lear,7.0,3.1.28,KENT,"Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,"
50799,50800,King Lear,7.0,3.1.29,KENT,Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
50800,50801,King Lear,7.0,3.1.30,KENT,"Against the old kind king, or something deeper,"
50801,50802,King Lear,7.0,3.1.31,KENT,"Whereof perchance these are but furnishings,"
50802,50803,King Lear,7.0,3.1.32,KENT,"But, true it is, from France there comes a power"
50803,50804,King Lear,7.0,3.1.33,KENT,"Into this scatter'd kingdom, who already,"
50804,50805,King Lear,7.0,3.1.34,KENT,"Wise in our negligence, have secret feet"
50805,50806,King Lear,7.0,3.1.35,KENT,"In some of our best ports, and are at point"
50806,50807,King Lear,7.0,3.1.36,KENT,To show their open banner. Now to you:
50807,50808,King Lear,7.0,3.1.37,KENT,If on my credit you dare build so far
50808,50809,King Lear,7.0,3.1.38,KENT,"To make your speed to Dover, you shall find"
50809,50810,King Lear,7.0,3.1.39,KENT,"Some that will thank you, making just report"
50810,50811,King Lear,7.0,3.1.40,KENT,Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
50811,50812,King Lear,7.0,3.1.41,KENT,The king hath cause to plain.
50812,50813,King Lear,7.0,3.1.42,KENT,"I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,"
50813,50814,King Lear,7.0,3.1.43,KENT,"And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer"
50814,50815,King Lear,7.0,3.1.44,KENT,This office to you.
50815,50816,King Lear,8.0,3.1.45,Gentleman,I will talk further with you.
50816,50817,King Lear,9.0,3.1.46,KENT,"No, do not."
50817,50818,King Lear,9.0,3.1.47,KENT,For confirmation that I am much more
50818,50819,King Lear,9.0,3.1.48,KENT,"Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take"
50819,50820,King Lear,9.0,3.1.49,KENT,"What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--"
50820,50821,King Lear,9.0,3.1.50,KENT,"As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring,"
50821,50822,King Lear,9.0,3.1.51,KENT,And she will tell you who your fellow is
50822,50823,King Lear,9.0,3.1.52,KENT,That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
50823,50824,King Lear,9.0,3.1.53,KENT,I will go seek the king.
50824,50825,King Lear,10.0,3.1.54,Gentleman,Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
50825,50826,King Lear,11.0,3.1.55,KENT,"Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet,"
50826,50827,King Lear,11.0,3.1.56,KENT,"That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain"
50827,50828,King Lear,11.0,3.1.57,KENT,"That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him"

50844,50845,King Lear,2.0,3.2.13,Fool,here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.
50845,50846,King Lear,3.0,3.2.14,KING LEAR,"Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!"
50846,50847,King Lear,3.0,3.2.15,KING LEAR,"Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:"

51465,51466,King Lear,1.0,4.1.8,EDGAR,The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
51466,51467,King Lear,1.0,4.1.9,EDGAR,Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
51467,51468,King Lear,1.0,,EDGAR,"Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man"
51468,51469,King Lear,1.0,4.1.10,EDGAR,"My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!"
51469,51470,King Lear,1.0,4.1.11,EDGAR,"But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,"
51470,51471,King Lear,1.0,4.1.12,EDGAR,Lie would not yield to age.
51471,51472,King Lear,2.0,4.1.13,Old Man,"O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and"
51472,51473,King Lear,2.0,4.1.14,Old Man,"your father's tenant, these fourscore years."
51473,51474,King Lear,3.0,4.1.15,GLOUCESTER,"Away, get thee away, good friend, be gone:"
51474,51475,King Lear,3.0,4.1.16,GLOUCESTER,"Thy comforts can do me no good at all,"
51475,51476,King Lear,3.0,4.1.17,GLOUCESTER,Thee they may hurt.
51476,51477,King Lear,4.0,4.1.18,Old Man,"Alack, sir, you cannot see your way."
51477,51478,King Lear,5.0,4.1.19,GLOUCESTER,"I have no way, and therefore want no eyes,"
51478,51479,King Lear,5.0,4.1.20,GLOUCESTER,"I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,"
51479,51480,King Lear,5.0,4.1.21,GLOUCESTER,"Our means secure us, and our mere defects"
51480,51481,King Lear,5.0,4.1.22,GLOUCESTER,"Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,"
51481,51482,King Lear,5.0,4.1.23,GLOUCESTER,The food of thy abused father's wrath!
51482,51483,King Lear,5.0,4.1.24,GLOUCESTER,"Might I but live to see thee in my touch,"
51483,51484,King Lear,5.0,4.1.25,GLOUCESTER,I'ld say I had eyes again!
51484,51485,King Lear,6.0,4.1.26,Old Man,How now! Who's there?
51485,51486,King Lear,7.0,4.1.27,EDGAR,[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
51486,51487,King Lear,7.0,4.1.28,EDGAR,the worst'?
51487,51488,King Lear,7.0,4.1.29,EDGAR,I am worse than e'er I was.
51488,51489,King Lear,8.0,4.1.30,Old Man,'Tis poor mad Tom.
51489,51490,King Lear,9.0,4.1.31,EDGAR,[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
51490,51491,King Lear,9.0,4.1.32,EDGAR,So long as we can say  'This is the worst.'
51491,51492,King Lear,10.0,4.1.33,Old Man,"Fellow, where goest?"
51492,51493,King Lear,11.0,4.1.34,GLOUCESTER,Is it a beggar-man?
51493,51494,King Lear,12.0,4.1.35,Old Man,Madman and beggar too.
51494,51495,King Lear,13.0,4.1.36,GLOUCESTER,"He has some reason, else he could not beg."
51495,51496,King Lear,13.0,4.1.37,GLOUCESTER,"I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw,"
51496,51497,King Lear,13.0,4.1.38,GLOUCESTER,Which made me think a man a worm: my son
51497,51498,King Lear,13.0,4.1.39,GLOUCESTER,"Came then into my mind, and yet my mind"
51498,51499,King Lear,13.0,4.1.40,GLOUCESTER,Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
51499,51500,King Lear,13.0,4.1.41,GLOUCESTER,more since.
51500,51501,King Lear,13.0,4.1.42,GLOUCESTER,"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods."
51501,51502,King Lear,13.0,4.1.43,GLOUCESTER,They kill us for their sport.
51502,51503,King Lear,14.0,4.1.44,EDGAR,[Aside]	How should this be?
51503,51504,King Lear,14.0,4.1.45,EDGAR,"Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,"
51504,51505,King Lear,14.0,4.1.46,EDGAR,"Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!"
51505,51506,King Lear,15.0,4.1.47,GLOUCESTER,Is that the naked fellow?
51506,51507,King Lear,16.0,4.1.48,Old Man,"Ay, my lord."
51507,51508,King Lear,17.0,4.1.49,GLOUCESTER,"Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,"
51508,51509,King Lear,17.0,4.1.50,GLOUCESTER,"Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,"
51509,51510,King Lear,17.0,4.1.51,GLOUCESTER,"I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,"
51510,51511,King Lear,17.0,4.1.52,GLOUCESTER,"And bring some covering for this naked soul,"
51511,51512,King Lear,17.0,4.1.53,GLOUCESTER,Who I'll entreat to lead me.
51512,51513,King Lear,18.0,4.1.54,Old Man,"Alack, sir, he is mad."
51513,51514,King Lear,19.0,4.1.55,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind."
51514,51515,King Lear,19.0,4.1.56,GLOUCESTER,"Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure,"
51515,51516,King Lear,19.0,4.1.57,GLOUCESTER,"Above the rest, be gone."
51516,51517,King Lear,20.0,4.1.58,Old Man,"I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,"
51517,51518,King Lear,20.0,4.1.59,Old Man,Come on't what will.
51518,51519,King Lear,20.0,,Old Man,Exit

51520,51521,King Lear,22.0,4.1.61,EDGAR,Poor Tom's a-cold.
51521,51522,King Lear,22.0,,EDGAR,Aside
51522,51523,King Lear,22.0,4.1.62,EDGAR,I cannot daub it further.
51523,51524,King Lear,23.0,4.1.63,GLOUCESTER,"Come hither, fellow."
51524,51525,King Lear,24.0,4.1.64,EDGAR,"[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed."
51525,51526,King Lear,25.0,4.1.65,GLOUCESTER,Know'st thou the way to Dover?
51526,51527,King Lear,26.0,4.1.66,EDGAR,"Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor"
51527,51528,King Lear,26.0,4.1.67,EDGAR,Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
51528,51529,King Lear,26.0,4.1.68,EDGAR,"thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five"
51529,51530,King Lear,26.0,4.1.69,EDGAR,"fiends have been in poor Tom at once, of lust, as"

51533,51534,King Lear,26.0,4.1.73,EDGAR,"and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!"
51534,51535,King Lear,27.0,4.1.74,GLOUCESTER,"Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues"
51535,51536,King Lear,27.0,4.1.75,GLOUCESTER,Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
51536,51537,King Lear,27.0,4.1.76,GLOUCESTER,"Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!"
51537,51538,King Lear,27.0,4.1.77,GLOUCESTER,"Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,"
51538,51539,King Lear,27.0,4.1.78,GLOUCESTER,"That slaves your ordinance, that will not see"

51540,51541,King Lear,27.0,4.1.80,GLOUCESTER,"So distribution should undo excess,"
51541,51542,King Lear,27.0,4.1.81,GLOUCESTER,And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
51542,51543,King Lear,28.0,4.1.82,EDGAR,"Ay, master."
51543,51544,King Lear,29.0,4.1.83,GLOUCESTER,"There is a cliff, whose high and bending head"
51544,51545,King Lear,29.0,4.1.84,GLOUCESTER,Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
51545,51546,King Lear,29.0,4.1.85,GLOUCESTER,"Bring me but to the very brim of it,"
51546,51547,King Lear,29.0,4.1.86,GLOUCESTER,And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
51547,51548,King Lear,29.0,4.1.87,GLOUCESTER,With something rich about me: from that place
51548,51549,King Lear,29.0,4.1.88,GLOUCESTER,I shall no leading need.
51549,51550,King Lear,30.0,4.1.89,EDGAR,Give me thy arm:

51553,51554,King Lear,30.0,,EDGAR,Enter GONERIL and EDMUND
51554,51555,King Lear,1.0,4.2.1,GONERIL,"Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband"
51555,51556,King Lear,1.0,4.2.2,GONERIL,Not met us on the way.
51556,51557,King Lear,1.0,,GONERIL,Enter OSWALD
51557,51558,King Lear,1.0,4.2.3,GONERIL,"Now, where's your master'?"
51558,51559,King Lear,2.0,4.2.4,OSWALD,"Madam, within, but never man so changed."
51559,51560,King Lear,2.0,4.2.5,OSWALD,"I told him of the army that was landed,"
51560,51561,King Lear,2.0,4.2.6,OSWALD,He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
51561,51562,King Lear,2.0,4.2.7,OSWALD,"His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,"
51562,51563,King Lear,2.0,4.2.8,OSWALD,"And of the loyal service of his son,"
51563,51564,King Lear,2.0,4.2.9,OSWALD,"When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,"
51564,51565,King Lear,2.0,4.2.10,OSWALD,And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
51565,51566,King Lear,2.0,4.2.11,OSWALD,"What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him,"
51566,51567,King Lear,2.0,4.2.12,OSWALD,"What like, offensive."
51567,51568,King Lear,3.0,4.2.13,GONERIL,[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.
51568,51569,King Lear,3.0,4.2.14,GONERIL,"It is the cowish terror of his spirit,"
51569,51570,King Lear,3.0,4.2.15,GONERIL,That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
51570,51571,King Lear,3.0,4.2.16,GONERIL,Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
51571,51572,King Lear,3.0,4.2.17,GONERIL,"May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother,"
51572,51573,King Lear,3.0,4.2.18,GONERIL,Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
51573,51574,King Lear,3.0,4.2.19,GONERIL,"I must change arms at home, and give the distaff"
51574,51575,King Lear,3.0,4.2.20,GONERIL,Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
51575,51576,King Lear,3.0,4.2.21,GONERIL,"Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,"
51576,51577,King Lear,3.0,4.2.22,GONERIL,"If you dare venture in your own behalf,"
51577,51578,King Lear,3.0,4.2.23,GONERIL,"A mistress's command. Wear this, spare speech,"
51578,51579,King Lear,3.0,,GONERIL,Giving a favour
51579,51580,King Lear,3.0,4.2.24,GONERIL,"Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,"
51580,51581,King Lear,3.0,4.2.25,GONERIL,Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
51581,51582,King Lear,3.0,4.2.26,GONERIL,"Conceive, and fare thee well."
51582,51583,King Lear,4.0,4.2.27,EDMUND,Yours in the ranks of death.
51583,51584,King Lear,5.0,4.2.28,GONERIL,My most dear Gloucester!

51585,51586,King Lear,5.0,4.2.29,GONERIL,"O, the difference of man and man!"
51586,51587,King Lear,5.0,4.2.30,GONERIL,To thee a woman's services are due:
51587,51588,King Lear,5.0,4.2.31,GONERIL,My fool usurps my body.
51588,51589,King Lear,6.0,4.2.32,OSWALD,"Madam, here comes my lord."
51589,51590,King Lear,6.0,,OSWALD,Exit
51590,51591,King Lear,6.0,,OSWALD,Enter ALBANY
51591,51592,King Lear,7.0,4.2.33,GONERIL,I have been worth the whistle.
51592,51593,King Lear,8.0,4.2.34,ALBANY,O Goneril!
51593,51594,King Lear,8.0,4.2.35,ALBANY,You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
51594,51595,King Lear,8.0,4.2.36,ALBANY,Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
51595,51596,King Lear,8.0,4.2.37,ALBANY,"That nature, which contemns its origin,"
51596,51597,King Lear,8.0,4.2.38,ALBANY,"Cannot be border'd certain in itself,"
51597,51598,King Lear,8.0,4.2.39,ALBANY,She that herself will sliver and disbranch
51598,51599,King Lear,8.0,4.2.40,ALBANY,"From her material sap, perforce must wither"
51599,51600,King Lear,8.0,4.2.41,ALBANY,And come to deadly use.
51600,51601,King Lear,9.0,4.2.42,GONERIL,"No more, the text is foolish."
51601,51602,King Lear,10.0,4.2.43,ALBANY,Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
51602,51603,King Lear,10.0,4.2.44,ALBANY,Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
51603,51604,King Lear,10.0,4.2.45,ALBANY,"Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?"
51604,51605,King Lear,10.0,4.2.46,ALBANY,"A father, and a gracious aged man,"
51605,51606,King Lear,10.0,4.2.47,ALBANY,"Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,"
51606,51607,King Lear,10.0,4.2.48,ALBANY,"Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded."
51607,51608,King Lear,10.0,4.2.49,ALBANY,Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
51608,51609,King Lear,10.0,4.2.50,ALBANY,"A man, a prince, by him so benefited!"
51609,51610,King Lear,10.0,4.2.51,ALBANY,If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
51610,51611,King Lear,10.0,4.2.52,ALBANY,"Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,"
51611,51612,King Lear,10.0,4.2.53,ALBANY,"It will come,"
51612,51613,King Lear,10.0,4.2.54,ALBANY,"Humanity must perforce prey on itself,"
51613,51614,King Lear,10.0,4.2.55,ALBANY,Like monsters of the deep.
51614,51615,King Lear,11.0,4.2.56,GONERIL,Milk-liver'd man!
51615,51616,King Lear,11.0,4.2.57,GONERIL,"That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs,"
51616,51617,King Lear,11.0,4.2.58,GONERIL,Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
51617,51618,King Lear,11.0,4.2.59,GONERIL,"Thine honour from thy suffering, that not know'st"
51618,51619,King Lear,11.0,4.2.60,GONERIL,Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
51619,51620,King Lear,11.0,4.2.61,GONERIL,Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
51620,51621,King Lear,11.0,4.2.62,GONERIL,"France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,"
51621,51622,King Lear,11.0,4.2.63,GONERIL,"With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats,"
51622,51623,King Lear,11.0,4.2.64,GONERIL,"Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest"
51623,51624,King Lear,11.0,4.2.65,GONERIL,"'Alack, why does he so?'"
51624,51625,King Lear,12.0,4.2.66,ALBANY,"See thyself, devil!"
51625,51626,King Lear,12.0,4.2.67,ALBANY,Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
51626,51627,King Lear,12.0,4.2.68,ALBANY,So horrid as in woman.
51627,51628,King Lear,13.0,4.2.69,GONERIL,O vain fool!
51628,51629,King Lear,14.0,4.2.70,ALBANY,"Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,"
51629,51630,King Lear,14.0,4.2.71,ALBANY,Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
51630,51631,King Lear,14.0,4.2.72,ALBANY,"To let these hands obey my blood,"
51631,51632,King Lear,14.0,4.2.73,ALBANY,They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
51632,51633,King Lear,14.0,4.2.74,ALBANY,"Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,"
51633,51634,King Lear,14.0,4.2.75,ALBANY,A woman's shape doth shield thee.
51634,51635,King Lear,15.0,4.2.76,GONERIL,"Marry, your manhood now--"
51635,51636,King Lear,15.0,,GONERIL,Enter a Messenger
51636,51637,King Lear,16.0,4.2.77,ALBANY,What news?
51637,51638,King Lear,17.0,4.2.78,Messenger,"O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:"
51638,51639,King Lear,17.0,4.2.79,Messenger,"Slain by his servant, going to put out"

51640,51641,King Lear,18.0,4.2.81,ALBANY,Gloucester's eye!
51641,51642,King Lear,19.0,4.2.82,Messenger,"A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,"
51642,51643,King Lear,19.0,4.2.83,Messenger,"Opposed against the act, bending his sword"
51643,51644,King Lear,19.0,4.2.84,Messenger,"To his great master, who, thereat enraged,"
51644,51645,King Lear,19.0,4.2.85,Messenger,"Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead,"
51645,51646,King Lear,19.0,4.2.86,Messenger,"But not without that harmful stroke, which since"
51646,51647,King Lear,19.0,4.2.87,Messenger,Hath pluck'd him after.
51647,51648,King Lear,20.0,4.2.88,ALBANY,"This shows you are above,"
51648,51649,King Lear,20.0,4.2.89,ALBANY,"You justicers, that these our nether crimes"
51649,51650,King Lear,20.0,4.2.90,ALBANY,"So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!"
51650,51651,King Lear,20.0,4.2.91,ALBANY,Lost he his other eye?
51651,51652,King Lear,21.0,4.2.92,Messenger,"Both, both, my lord."
51652,51653,King Lear,21.0,4.2.93,Messenger,"This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer,"

51664,51665,King Lear,27.0,4.2.104,ALBANY,Knows he the wickedness?
51665,51666,King Lear,28.0,4.2.105,Messenger,"Ay, my good lord, 'twas he inform'd against him,"

51676,51677,King Lear,1.0,4.3.2,KENT,know you the reason?
51677,51678,King Lear,2.0,4.3.3,Gentleman,Something he left imperfect in the
51678,51679,King Lear,2.0,4.3.4,Gentleman,"state, which since his coming forth is thought"
51679,51680,King Lear,2.0,4.3.5,Gentleman,"of, which imports to the kingdom so much"
51680,51681,King Lear,2.0,4.3.6,Gentleman,"fear and danger, that his personal return was"
51681,51682,King Lear,2.0,4.3.7,Gentleman,most required and necessary.
51682,51683,King Lear,3.0,4.3.8,KENT,Who hath he left behind him general?
51683,51684,King Lear,4.0,4.3.9,Gentleman,"The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far."
51684,51685,King Lear,5.0,4.3.10,KENT,Did your letters pierce the queen to any
51685,51686,King Lear,5.0,4.3.11,KENT,demonstration of grief?
51686,51687,King Lear,6.0,4.3.12,Gentleman,"Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence,"

51688,51689,King Lear,6.0,4.3.14,Gentleman,Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
51689,51690,King Lear,6.0,4.3.15,Gentleman,"Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,"
51690,51691,King Lear,6.0,4.3.16,Gentleman,Sought to be king o'er her.
51691,51692,King Lear,7.0,4.3.17,KENT,"O, then it moved her."
51692,51693,King Lear,8.0,4.3.18,Gentleman,Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
51693,51694,King Lear,8.0,4.3.19,Gentleman,Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
51694,51695,King Lear,8.0,4.3.20,Gentleman,Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
51695,51696,King Lear,8.0,4.3.21,Gentleman,"Were like a better way: those happy smilets,"
51696,51697,King Lear,8.0,4.3.22,Gentleman,"That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know"
51697,51698,King Lear,8.0,4.3.23,Gentleman,"What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence,"
51698,51699,King Lear,8.0,4.3.24,Gentleman,"As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,"
51699,51700,King Lear,8.0,4.3.25,Gentleman,"Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,"
51700,51701,King Lear,8.0,4.3.26,Gentleman,If all could so become it.
51701,51702,King Lear,9.0,4.3.27,KENT,Made she no verbal question?
51702,51703,King Lear,10.0,4.3.28,Gentleman,"'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'"
51703,51704,King Lear,10.0,4.3.29,Gentleman,"Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:"
51704,51705,King Lear,10.0,4.3.30,Gentleman,Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
51705,51706,King Lear,10.0,4.3.31,Gentleman,"Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?"
51706,51707,King Lear,10.0,4.3.32,Gentleman,Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
51707,51708,King Lear,10.0,4.3.33,Gentleman,"The holy water from her heavenly eyes,"
51708,51709,King Lear,10.0,4.3.34,Gentleman,And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
51709,51710,King Lear,10.0,4.3.35,Gentleman,To deal with grief alone.
51710,51711,King Lear,11.0,4.3.36,KENT,"It is the stars,"
51711,51712,King Lear,11.0,4.3.37,KENT,"The stars above us, govern our conditions,"
51712,51713,King Lear,11.0,4.3.38,KENT,Else one self mate and mate could not beget
51713,51714,King Lear,11.0,4.3.39,KENT,Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
51714,51715,King Lear,12.0,4.3.40,Gentleman,No.
51715,51716,King Lear,13.0,4.3.41,KENT,Was this before the king return'd?
51716,51717,King Lear,14.0,4.3.42,Gentleman,"No, since."
51717,51718,King Lear,15.0,4.3.43,KENT,"Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town,"
51718,51719,King Lear,15.0,4.3.44,KENT,"Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers"
51719,51720,King Lear,15.0,4.3.45,KENT,"What we are come about, and by no means"
51720,51721,King Lear,15.0,4.3.46,KENT,Will yield to see his daughter.
51721,51722,King Lear,16.0,4.3.47,Gentleman,"Why, good sir?"
51722,51723,King Lear,17.0,4.3.48,KENT,"A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,"
51723,51724,King Lear,17.0,4.3.49,KENT,"That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her"
51724,51725,King Lear,17.0,4.3.50,KENT,"To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights"
51725,51726,King Lear,17.0,4.3.51,KENT,"To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting"
51726,51727,King Lear,17.0,4.3.52,KENT,"His mind so venomously, that burning shame"
51727,51728,King Lear,17.0,4.3.53,KENT,Detains him from Cordelia.
51728,51729,King Lear,18.0,4.3.54,Gentleman,"Alack, poor gentleman!"
51729,51730,King Lear,19.0,4.3.55,KENT,Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
51730,51731,King Lear,20.0,4.3.56,Gentleman,"'Tis so, they are afoot."
51731,51732,King Lear,21.0,4.3.57,KENT,"Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,"
51732,51733,King Lear,21.0,4.3.58,KENT,And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
51733,51734,King Lear,21.0,4.3.59,KENT,"Will in concealment wrap me up awhile,"
51734,51735,King Lear,21.0,4.3.60,KENT,"When I am known aright, you shall not grieve"
51735,51736,King Lear,21.0,4.3.61,KENT,"Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go"

51782,51783,King Lear,5.0,4.5.6,REGAN,Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

51784,51785,King Lear,7.0,4.5.8,REGAN,What might import my sister's letter to him?

51786,51787,King Lear,9.0,4.5.10,REGAN,"'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter."
51787,51788,King Lear,9.0,4.5.11,REGAN,"It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,"
51788,51789,King Lear,9.0,4.5.12,REGAN,To let him live: where he arrives he moves
51789,51790,King Lear,9.0,4.5.13,REGAN,"All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,"
51790,51791,King Lear,9.0,4.5.14,REGAN,"In pity of his misery, to dispatch"
51791,51792,King Lear,9.0,4.5.15,REGAN,"His nighted life: moreover, to descry"

51796,51797,King Lear,12.0,4.5.20,OSWALD,"I may not, madam:"
51797,51798,King Lear,12.0,4.5.21,OSWALD,My lady charged my duty in this business.
51798,51799,King Lear,13.0,4.5.22,REGAN,Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
51799,51800,King Lear,13.0,4.5.23,REGAN,"Transport her purposes by word? Belike,"
51800,51801,King Lear,13.0,4.5.24,REGAN,"Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,"

51802,51803,King Lear,14.0,4.5.26,OSWALD,"Madam, I had rather--"
51803,51804,King Lear,15.0,4.5.27,REGAN,"I know your lady does not love her husband,"
51804,51805,King Lear,15.0,4.5.28,REGAN,I am sure of that: and at her late being here
51805,51806,King Lear,15.0,4.5.29,REGAN,She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
51806,51807,King Lear,15.0,4.5.30,REGAN,To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
51807,51808,King Lear,16.0,4.5.31,OSWALD,"I, madam?"
51808,51809,King Lear,17.0,4.5.32,REGAN,"I speak in understanding, you are, I know't:"
51809,51810,King Lear,17.0,4.5.33,REGAN,"Therefore I do advise you, take this note:"
51810,51811,King Lear,17.0,4.5.34,REGAN,"My lord is dead, Edmund and I have talk'd,"
51811,51812,King Lear,17.0,4.5.35,REGAN,And more convenient is he for my hand
51812,51813,King Lear,17.0,4.5.36,REGAN,Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
51813,51814,King Lear,17.0,4.5.37,REGAN,"If you do find him, pray you, give him this,"
51814,51815,King Lear,17.0,4.5.38,REGAN,"And when your mistress hears thus much from you,"
51815,51816,King Lear,17.0,4.5.39,REGAN,"I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her."
51816,51817,King Lear,17.0,4.5.40,REGAN,"So, fare you well."
51817,51818,King Lear,17.0,4.5.41,REGAN,"If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,"
51818,51819,King Lear,17.0,4.5.42,REGAN,Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
51819,51820,King Lear,18.0,4.5.43,OSWALD,"Would I could meet him, madam! I should show"
51820,51821,King Lear,18.0,4.5.44,OSWALD,What party I do follow.
51821,51822,King Lear,19.0,4.5.45,REGAN,Fare thee well.

51827,51828,King Lear,3.0,4.6.3,GLOUCESTER,Methinks the ground is even.
51828,51829,King Lear,4.0,4.6.4,EDGAR,Horrible steep.
51829,51830,King Lear,4.0,4.6.5,EDGAR,"Hark, do you hear the sea?"
51830,51831,King Lear,5.0,4.6.6,GLOUCESTER,"No, truly."
51831,51832,King Lear,6.0,4.6.7,EDGAR,"Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect"
51832,51833,King Lear,6.0,4.6.8,EDGAR,By your eyes' anguish.
51833,51834,King Lear,7.0,4.6.9,GLOUCESTER,"So may it be, indeed:"
51834,51835,King Lear,7.0,4.6.10,GLOUCESTER,"Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st"
51835,51836,King Lear,7.0,4.6.11,GLOUCESTER,In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
51836,51837,King Lear,8.0,4.6.12,EDGAR,You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
51837,51838,King Lear,8.0,4.6.13,EDGAR,But in my garments.
51838,51839,King Lear,9.0,4.6.14,GLOUCESTER,Methinks you're better spoken.
51839,51840,King Lear,10.0,4.6.15,EDGAR,"Come on, sir, here's the place: stand still. How fearful"
51840,51841,King Lear,10.0,4.6.16,EDGAR,"And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!"
51841,51842,King Lear,10.0,4.6.17,EDGAR,The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
51842,51843,King Lear,10.0,4.6.18,EDGAR,Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down

51848,51849,King Lear,10.0,4.6.24,EDGAR,"Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,"
51849,51850,King Lear,10.0,4.6.25,EDGAR,"That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,"
51850,51851,King Lear,10.0,4.6.26,EDGAR,"Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,"
51851,51852,King Lear,10.0,4.6.27,EDGAR,"Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight"
51852,51853,King Lear,10.0,4.6.28,EDGAR,Topple down headlong.
51853,51854,King Lear,11.0,4.6.29,GLOUCESTER,Set me where you stand.
51854,51855,King Lear,12.0,4.6.30,EDGAR,Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
51855,51856,King Lear,12.0,4.6.31,EDGAR,Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
51856,51857,King Lear,12.0,4.6.32,EDGAR,Would I not leap upright.
51857,51858,King Lear,13.0,4.6.33,GLOUCESTER,Let go my hand.
51858,51859,King Lear,13.0,4.6.34,GLOUCESTER,"Here, friend, 's another purse, in it a jewel"
51859,51860,King Lear,13.0,4.6.35,GLOUCESTER,Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
51860,51861,King Lear,13.0,4.6.36,GLOUCESTER,"Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off,"
51861,51862,King Lear,13.0,4.6.37,GLOUCESTER,"Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going."
51862,51863,King Lear,14.0,4.6.38,EDGAR,"Now fare you well, good sir."
51863,51864,King Lear,15.0,4.6.39,GLOUCESTER,With all my heart.
51864,51865,King Lear,16.0,4.6.40,EDGAR,Why I do trifle thus with his despair
51865,51866,King Lear,16.0,4.6.41,EDGAR,Is done to cure it.
51866,51867,King Lear,17.0,4.6.42,GLOUCESTER,[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!
51867,51868,King Lear,17.0,4.6.43,GLOUCESTER,"This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,"
51868,51869,King Lear,17.0,4.6.44,GLOUCESTER,Shake patiently my great affliction off:
51869,51870,King Lear,17.0,4.6.45,GLOUCESTER,"If I could bear it longer, and not fall"
51870,51871,King Lear,17.0,4.6.46,GLOUCESTER,"To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,"
51871,51872,King Lear,17.0,4.6.47,GLOUCESTER,My snuff and loathed part of nature should
51872,51873,King Lear,17.0,4.6.48,GLOUCESTER,"Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!"
51873,51874,King Lear,17.0,4.6.49,GLOUCESTER,"Now, fellow, fare thee well."
51874,51875,King Lear,17.0,,GLOUCESTER,He falls forward
51875,51876,King Lear,18.0,4.6.50,EDGAR,"Gone, sir: farewell."
51876,51877,King Lear,18.0,4.6.51,EDGAR,And yet I know not how conceit may rob
51877,51878,King Lear,18.0,4.6.52,EDGAR,"The treasury of life, when life itself"
51878,51879,King Lear,18.0,4.6.53,EDGAR,"Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,"
51879,51880,King Lear,18.0,4.6.54,EDGAR,"By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?"
51880,51881,King Lear,18.0,4.6.55,EDGAR,"Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!"
51881,51882,King Lear,18.0,4.6.56,EDGAR,Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
51882,51883,King Lear,18.0,4.6.57,EDGAR,"What are you, sir?"
51883,51884,King Lear,19.0,4.6.58,GLOUCESTER,"Away, and let me die."
51884,51885,King Lear,20.0,4.6.59,EDGAR,"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,"
51885,51886,King Lear,20.0,4.6.60,EDGAR,"So many fathom down precipitating,"
51886,51887,King Lear,20.0,4.6.61,EDGAR,"Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe,"
51887,51888,King Lear,20.0,4.6.62,EDGAR,"Hast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound."
51888,51889,King Lear,20.0,4.6.63,EDGAR,Ten masts at each make not the altitude
51889,51890,King Lear,20.0,4.6.64,EDGAR,Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
51890,51891,King Lear,20.0,4.6.65,EDGAR,Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
51891,51892,King Lear,21.0,4.6.66,GLOUCESTER,"But have I fall'n, or no?"
51892,51893,King Lear,22.0,4.6.67,EDGAR,From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
51893,51894,King Lear,22.0,4.6.68,EDGAR,"Look up a-height, the shrill-gorged lark so far"
51894,51895,King Lear,22.0,4.6.69,EDGAR,Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
51895,51896,King Lear,23.0,4.6.70,GLOUCESTER,"Alack, I have no eyes."
51896,51897,King Lear,23.0,4.6.71,GLOUCESTER,"Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,"
51897,51898,King Lear,23.0,4.6.72,GLOUCESTER,"To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,"
51898,51899,King Lear,23.0,4.6.73,GLOUCESTER,"When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,"
51899,51900,King Lear,23.0,4.6.74,GLOUCESTER,And frustrate his proud will.
51900,51901,King Lear,24.0,4.6.75,EDGAR,Give me your arm:
51901,51902,King Lear,24.0,4.6.76,EDGAR,Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
51902,51903,King Lear,25.0,4.6.77,GLOUCESTER,"Too well, too well."
51903,51904,King Lear,26.0,4.6.78,EDGAR,This is above all strangeness.
51904,51905,King Lear,26.0,4.6.79,EDGAR,"Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that"
51905,51906,King Lear,26.0,4.6.80,EDGAR,Which parted from you?
51906,51907,King Lear,27.0,4.6.81,GLOUCESTER,A poor unfortunate beggar.
51907,51908,King Lear,28.0,4.6.82,EDGAR,"As I stood here below, methought his eyes"
51908,51909,King Lear,28.0,4.6.83,EDGAR,"Were two full moons, he had a thousand noses,"
51909,51910,King Lear,28.0,4.6.84,EDGAR,Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
51910,51911,King Lear,28.0,4.6.85,EDGAR,"It was some fiend, therefore, thou happy father,"
51911,51912,King Lear,28.0,4.6.86,EDGAR,"Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours"
51912,51913,King Lear,28.0,4.6.87,EDGAR,"Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee."
51913,51914,King Lear,29.0,4.6.88,GLOUCESTER,I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
51914,51915,King Lear,29.0,4.6.89,GLOUCESTER,Affliction till it do cry out itself
51915,51916,King Lear,29.0,4.6.90,GLOUCESTER,"'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,"
51916,51917,King Lear,29.0,4.6.91,GLOUCESTER,"I took it for a man, often 'twould say"
51917,51918,King Lear,29.0,4.6.92,GLOUCESTER,"'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place."
51918,51919,King Lear,30.0,4.6.93,EDGAR,Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
51919,51920,King Lear,30.0,,EDGAR,"Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers"
51920,51921,King Lear,30.0,4.6.94,EDGAR,The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
51921,51922,King Lear,30.0,4.6.95,EDGAR,His master thus.
51922,51923,King Lear,31.0,4.6.96,KING LEAR,"No, they cannot touch me for coining, I am the"
51923,51924,King Lear,31.0,4.6.97,KING LEAR,king himself.
51924,51925,King Lear,32.0,4.6.98,EDGAR,O thou side-piercing sight!
51925,51926,King Lear,33.0,4.6.99,KING LEAR,Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
51926,51927,King Lear,33.0,4.6.100,KING LEAR,press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
51927,51928,King Lear,33.0,4.6.101,KING LEAR,"crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,"
51928,51929,King Lear,33.0,4.6.102,KING LEAR,"look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted"
51929,51930,King Lear,33.0,4.6.103,KING LEAR,"cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet, I'll prove"
51930,51931,King Lear,33.0,4.6.104,KING LEAR,"it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well"
51931,51932,King Lear,33.0,4.6.105,KING LEAR,"flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!"
51932,51933,King Lear,33.0,4.6.106,KING LEAR,Give the word.
51933,51934,King Lear,34.0,4.6.107,EDGAR,Sweet marjoram.
51934,51935,King Lear,35.0,4.6.108,KING LEAR,Pass.
51935,51936,King Lear,36.0,4.6.109,GLOUCESTER,I know that voice.
51936,51937,King Lear,37.0,4.6.110,KING LEAR,"Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered"
51937,51938,King Lear,37.0,4.6.111,KING LEAR,"me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my"
51938,51939,King Lear,37.0,4.6.112,KING LEAR,beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
51939,51940,King Lear,37.0,4.6.113,KING LEAR,and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
51940,51941,King Lear,37.0,4.6.114,KING LEAR,too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
51941,51942,King Lear,37.0,4.6.115,KING LEAR,"wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, when"
51942,51943,King Lear,37.0,4.6.116,KING LEAR,"the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I"
51943,51944,King Lear,37.0,4.6.117,KING LEAR,"found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are"
51944,51945,King Lear,37.0,4.6.118,KING LEAR,not men o' their words: they told me I was every
51945,51946,King Lear,37.0,4.6.119,KING LEAR,"thing, 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof."
51946,51947,King Lear,38.0,4.6.120,GLOUCESTER,The trick of that voice I do well remember:
51947,51948,King Lear,38.0,4.6.121,GLOUCESTER,Is 't not the king?
51948,51949,King Lear,39.0,4.6.122,KING LEAR,"Ay, every inch a king:"
51949,51950,King Lear,39.0,4.6.123,KING LEAR,"When I do stare, see how the subject quakes."
51950,51951,King Lear,39.0,4.6.124,KING LEAR,I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
51951,51952,King Lear,39.0,4.6.125,KING LEAR,Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
51952,51953,King Lear,39.0,4.6.126,KING LEAR,"The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly"
51953,51954,King Lear,39.0,4.6.127,KING LEAR,Does lecher in my sight.
51954,51955,King Lear,39.0,4.6.128,KING LEAR,"Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester's bastard son"
51955,51956,King Lear,39.0,4.6.129,KING LEAR,Was kinder to his father than my daughters
51956,51957,King Lear,39.0,4.6.130,KING LEAR,Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
51957,51958,King Lear,39.0,4.6.131,KING LEAR,"To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers."
51958,51959,King Lear,39.0,4.6.132,KING LEAR,"Behold yond simpering dame,"
51959,51960,King Lear,39.0,4.6.133,KING LEAR,"Whose face between her forks presages snow,"
51960,51961,King Lear,39.0,4.6.134,KING LEAR,"That minces virtue, and does shake the head"
51961,51962,King Lear,39.0,4.6.135,KING LEAR,"To hear of pleasure's name,"
51962,51963,King Lear,39.0,4.6.136,KING LEAR,"The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't"
51963,51964,King Lear,39.0,4.6.137,KING LEAR,With a more riotous appetite.
51964,51965,King Lear,39.0,4.6.138,KING LEAR,"Down from the waist they are Centaurs,"
51965,51966,King Lear,39.0,4.6.139,KING LEAR,Though women all above:

51967,51968,King Lear,39.0,4.6.141,KING LEAR,"Beneath is all the fiends',"

51971,51972,King Lear,39.0,4.6.145,KING LEAR,"fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,"
51972,51973,King Lear,39.0,4.6.146,KING LEAR,"good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:"
51973,51974,King Lear,39.0,4.6.147,KING LEAR,there's money for thee.
51974,51975,King Lear,40.0,4.6.148,GLOUCESTER,"O, let me kiss that hand!"
51975,51976,King Lear,41.0,4.6.149,KING LEAR,"Let me wipe it first, it smells of mortality."
51976,51977,King Lear,42.0,4.6.150,GLOUCESTER,O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
51977,51978,King Lear,42.0,4.6.151,GLOUCESTER,Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
51978,51979,King Lear,43.0,4.6.152,KING LEAR,I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
51979,51980,King Lear,43.0,4.6.153,KING LEAR,"at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not"

51982,51983,King Lear,44.0,4.6.156,GLOUCESTER,"Were all the letters suns, I could not see one."
51983,51984,King Lear,45.0,4.6.157,EDGAR,"I would not take this from report, it is,"
51984,51985,King Lear,45.0,4.6.158,EDGAR,And my heart breaks at it.
51985,51986,King Lear,46.0,4.6.159,KING LEAR,Read.
51986,51987,King Lear,47.0,4.6.160,GLOUCESTER,"What, with the case of eyes?"
51987,51988,King Lear,48.0,4.6.161,KING LEAR,"O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your"

51990,51991,King Lear,48.0,4.6.164,KING LEAR,this world goes.
51991,51992,King Lear,49.0,4.6.165,GLOUCESTER,I see it feelingly.
51992,51993,King Lear,50.0,4.6.166,KING LEAR,"What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes"
51993,51994,King Lear,50.0,4.6.167,KING LEAR,with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
51994,51995,King Lear,50.0,4.6.168,KING LEAR,"justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in"
51995,51996,King Lear,50.0,4.6.169,KING LEAR,"thine ear: change places, and, handy-dandy, which"
51996,51997,King Lear,50.0,4.6.170,KING LEAR,"is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen"
51997,51998,King Lear,50.0,4.6.171,KING LEAR,a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
51998,51999,King Lear,51.0,4.6.172,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, sir."
51999,52000,King Lear,52.0,4.6.173,KING LEAR,And the creature run from the cur? There thou
52000,52001,King Lear,52.0,4.6.174,KING LEAR,mightst behold the great image of authority: a

52002,52003,King Lear,52.0,4.6.176,KING LEAR,"Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!"
52003,52004,King Lear,52.0,4.6.177,KING LEAR,"Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back,"
52004,52005,King Lear,52.0,4.6.178,KING LEAR,Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
52005,52006,King Lear,52.0,4.6.179,KING LEAR,For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
52006,52007,King Lear,52.0,4.6.180,KING LEAR,"Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear,"
52007,52008,King Lear,52.0,4.6.181,KING LEAR,"Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,"
52008,52009,King Lear,52.0,4.6.182,KING LEAR,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
52009,52010,King Lear,52.0,4.6.183,KING LEAR,"Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it."
52010,52011,King Lear,52.0,4.6.184,KING LEAR,"None does offend, none, I say, none, I'll able 'em:"

52016,52017,King Lear,53.0,4.6.190,EDGAR,"O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!"
52017,52018,King Lear,54.0,4.6.191,KING LEAR,"If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes."
52018,52019,King Lear,54.0,4.6.192,KING LEAR,"I know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester:"

52217,52218,King Lear,24.0,4.7.64,KING LEAR,I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured

52284,52285,King Lear,7.0,5.1.14,EDMUND,That thought abuses you.
52285,52286,King Lear,8.0,5.1.15,REGAN,I am doubtful that you have been conjunct

52304,52305,King Lear,15.0,5.1.33,REGAN,Why is this reason'd?
52305,52306,King Lear,16.0,5.1.34,GONERIL,"Combine together 'gainst the enemy,"
52306,52307,King Lear,16.0,5.1.35,GONERIL,For these domestic and particular broils
52307,52308,King Lear,16.0,5.1.36,GONERIL,Are not the question here.

52426,52427,King Lear,10.0,5.3.46,ALBANY,And fortune led you well: you have the captives
52427,52428,King Lear,10.0,5.3.47,ALBANY,That were the opposites of this day's strife:
52428,52429,King Lear,10.0,5.3.48,ALBANY,"We do require them of you, so to use them"
52429,52430,King Lear,10.0,5.3.49,ALBANY,As we shall find their merits and our safety

52486,52487,King Lear,27.0,5.3.105,ALBANY,"Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:"
52487,52488,King Lear,27.0,5.3.106,ALBANY,If none appear to prove upon thy head

52598,52599,King Lear,58.0,5.3.204,EDMUND,"Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true,"
52599,52600,King Lear,58.0,5.3.205,EDMUND,The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
52600,52601,King Lear,59.0,5.3.206,ALBANY,Methought thy very gait did prophesy
52601,52602,King Lear,59.0,5.3.207,ALBANY,A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
52602,52603,King Lear,59.0,5.3.208,ALBANY,"Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I"
52603,52604,King Lear,59.0,5.3.209,ALBANY,Did hate thee or thy father!
52604,52605,King Lear,60.0,5.3.210,EDGAR,"Worthy prince, I know't."
52605,52606,King Lear,61.0,5.3.211,ALBANY,Where have you hid yourself?
52606,52607,King Lear,61.0,5.3.212,ALBANY,How have you known the miseries of your father?
52607,52608,King Lear,62.0,5.3.213,EDGAR,"By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale,"
52608,52609,King Lear,62.0,5.3.214,EDGAR,"And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!"
52609,52610,King Lear,62.0,5.3.215,EDGAR,"The bloody proclamation to escape,"
52610,52611,King Lear,62.0,5.3.216,EDGAR,"That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!"
52611,52612,King Lear,62.0,5.3.217,EDGAR,That we the pain of death would hourly die
52612,52613,King Lear,62.0,5.3.218,EDGAR,Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
52613,52614,King Lear,62.0,5.3.219,EDGAR,"Into a madman's rags, to assume a semblance"
52614,52615,King Lear,62.0,5.3.220,EDGAR,That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
52615,52616,King Lear,62.0,5.3.221,EDGAR,"Met I my father with his bleeding rings,"
52616,52617,King Lear,62.0,5.3.222,EDGAR,"Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,"
52617,52618,King Lear,62.0,5.3.223,EDGAR,"Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair,"
52618,52619,King Lear,62.0,5.3.224,EDGAR,"Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,"
52619,52620,King Lear,62.0,5.3.225,EDGAR,"Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:"
52620,52621,King Lear,62.0,5.3.226,EDGAR,"Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,"
52621,52622,King Lear,62.0,5.3.227,EDGAR,"I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last"
52622,52623,King Lear,62.0,5.3.228,EDGAR,"Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,"
52623,52624,King Lear,62.0,5.3.229,EDGAR,"Alack, too weak the conflict to support!"
52624,52625,King Lear,62.0,5.3.230,EDGAR,"'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,"
52625,52626,King Lear,62.0,5.3.231,EDGAR,Burst smilingly.
52626,52627,King Lear,63.0,5.3.232,EDMUND,"This speech of yours hath moved me,"
52627,52628,King Lear,63.0,5.3.233,EDMUND,"And shall perchance do good: but speak you on,"
52628,52629,King Lear,63.0,5.3.234,EDMUND,You look as you had something more to say.
52629,52630,King Lear,64.0,5.3.235,ALBANY,"If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,"
52630,52631,King Lear,64.0,5.3.236,ALBANY,"For I am almost ready to dissolve,"
52631,52632,King Lear,64.0,5.3.237,ALBANY,Hearing of this.
52632,52633,King Lear,65.0,5.3.238,EDGAR,This would have seem'd a period
52633,52634,King Lear,65.0,5.3.239,EDGAR,"To such as love not sorrow, but another,"
52634,52635,King Lear,65.0,5.3.240,EDGAR,"To amplify too much, would make much more,"
52635,52636,King Lear,65.0,5.3.241,EDGAR,And top extremity.
52636,52637,King Lear,65.0,5.3.242,EDGAR,"Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,"
52637,52638,King Lear,65.0,5.3.243,EDGAR,"Who, having seen me in my worst estate,"
52638,52639,King Lear,65.0,5.3.244,EDGAR,"Shunn'd my abhorr'd society, but then, finding"
52639,52640,King Lear,65.0,5.3.245,EDGAR,"Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms"
52640,52641,King Lear,65.0,5.3.246,EDGAR,"He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out"
52641,52642,King Lear,65.0,5.3.247,EDGAR,"As he'ld burst heaven, threw him on my father,"
52642,52643,King Lear,65.0,5.3.248,EDGAR,Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
52643,52644,King Lear,65.0,5.3.249,EDGAR,That ever ear received: which in recounting
52644,52645,King Lear,65.0,5.3.250,EDGAR,His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
52645,52646,King Lear,65.0,5.3.251,EDGAR,"Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,"
52646,52647,King Lear,65.0,5.3.252,EDGAR,And there I left him tranced.
52647,52648,King Lear,66.0,5.3.253,ALBANY,But who was this?
52648,52649,King Lear,67.0,5.3.254,EDGAR,"Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent, who in disguise"
52649,52650,King Lear,67.0,5.3.255,EDGAR,"Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service"
52650,52651,King Lear,67.0,5.3.256,EDGAR,Improper for a slave.
52651,52652,King Lear,67.0,,EDGAR,"Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife"
52652,52653,King Lear,68.0,5.3.257,Gentleman,"Help, help, O, help!"
52653,52654,King Lear,69.0,5.3.258,EDGAR,What kind of help?
52654,52655,King Lear,70.0,5.3.259,ALBANY,"Speak, man."
52655,52656,King Lear,71.0,5.3.260,EDGAR,What means that bloody knife?
52656,52657,King Lear,72.0,5.3.261,Gentleman,"'Tis hot, it smokes,"
52657,52658,King Lear,72.0,5.3.262,Gentleman,"It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!"
52658,52659,King Lear,73.0,5.3.263,ALBANY,"Who dead? speak, man."
52659,52660,King Lear,74.0,5.3.264,Gentleman,"Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister"
52660,52661,King Lear,74.0,5.3.265,Gentleman,"By her is poisoned, she hath confess'd it."
52661,52662,King Lear,75.0,5.3.266,EDMUND,I was contracted to them both: all three
52662,52663,King Lear,75.0,5.3.267,EDMUND,Now marry in an instant.
52663,52664,King Lear,76.0,5.3.268,EDGAR,Here comes Kent.
52664,52665,King Lear,77.0,5.3.269,ALBANY,"Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:"
52665,52666,King Lear,77.0,5.3.270,ALBANY,"This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,"
52666,52667,King Lear,77.0,5.3.271,ALBANY,Touches us not with pity.
52667,52668,King Lear,77.0,,ALBANY,Exit Gentleman
52668,52669,King Lear,77.0,,ALBANY,Enter KENT
52669,52670,King Lear,77.0,5.3.272,ALBANY,"O, is this he?"
52670,52671,King Lear,77.0,5.3.273,ALBANY,The time will not allow the compliment
52671,52672,King Lear,77.0,5.3.274,ALBANY,Which very manners urges.
52672,52673,King Lear,78.0,5.3.275,KENT,I am come
52673,52674,King Lear,78.0,5.3.276,KENT,To bid my king and master aye good night:
52674,52675,King Lear,78.0,5.3.277,KENT,Is he not here?
52675,52676,King Lear,79.0,5.3.278,ALBANY,Great thing of us forgot!
52676,52677,King Lear,79.0,5.3.279,ALBANY,"Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?"
52677,52678,King Lear,79.0,5.3.280,ALBANY,"See'st thou this object, Kent?"
52678,52679,King Lear,79.0,,ALBANY,The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in
52679,52680,King Lear,80.0,5.3.281,KENT,"Alack, why thus?"
52680,52681,King Lear,81.0,5.3.282,EDMUND,Yet Edmund was beloved:
52681,52682,King Lear,81.0,5.3.283,EDMUND,"The one the other poison'd for my sake,"
52682,52683,King Lear,81.0,5.3.284,EDMUND,And after slew herself.
52683,52684,King Lear,82.0,5.3.285,ALBANY,Even so. Cover their faces.
52684,52685,King Lear,83.0,5.3.286,EDMUND,"I pant for life: some good I mean to do,"
52685,52686,King Lear,83.0,5.3.287,EDMUND,"Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,"
52686,52687,King Lear,83.0,5.3.288,EDMUND,"Be brief in it, to the castle, for my writ"
52687,52688,King Lear,83.0,5.3.289,EDMUND,Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
52688,52689,King Lear,83.0,5.3.290,EDMUND,"Nay, send in time."
52689,52690,King Lear,84.0,5.3.291,ALBANY,"Run, run, O, run!"
52690,52691,King Lear,85.0,5.3.292,EDGAR,"To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send"
52691,52692,King Lear,85.0,5.3.293,EDGAR,Thy token of reprieve.
52692,52693,King Lear,86.0,5.3.294,EDMUND,"Well thought on: take my sword,"
52693,52694,King Lear,86.0,5.3.295,EDMUND,Give it the captain.
52694,52695,King Lear,87.0,5.3.296,ALBANY,"Haste thee, for thy life."
52695,52696,King Lear,87.0,,ALBANY,Exit EDGAR
52696,52697,King Lear,88.0,5.3.297,EDMUND,He hath commission from thy wife and me
52697,52698,King Lear,88.0,5.3.298,EDMUND,"To hang Cordelia in the prison, and"
52698,52699,King Lear,88.0,5.3.299,EDMUND,"To lay the blame upon her own despair,"
52699,52700,King Lear,88.0,5.3.300,EDMUND,That she fordid herself.
52700,52701,King Lear,89.0,5.3.301,ALBANY,The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
52701,52702,King Lear,89.0,,ALBANY,EDMUND is borne off
52702,52703,King Lear,89.0,,ALBANY,"Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms, EDGAR, Captain, and others following"
52703,52704,King Lear,90.0,5.3.302,KING LEAR,"Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:"
52704,52705,King Lear,90.0,5.3.303,KING LEAR,"Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so"
52705,52706,King Lear,90.0,5.3.304,KING LEAR,That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
52706,52707,King Lear,90.0,5.3.305,KING LEAR,"I know when one is dead, and when one lives,"
52707,52708,King Lear,90.0,5.3.306,KING LEAR,"She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass,"
52708,52709,King Lear,90.0,5.3.307,KING LEAR,"If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,"
52709,52710,King Lear,90.0,5.3.308,KING LEAR,"Why, then she lives."
52710,52711,King Lear,91.0,5.3.309,KENT,Is this the promised end
52711,52712,King Lear,92.0,5.3.310,EDGAR,Or image of that horror?
52712,52713,King Lear,93.0,5.3.311,ALBANY,"Fall, and cease!"
52713,52714,King Lear,94.0,5.3.312,KING LEAR,"This feather stirs, she lives! if it be so,"
52714,52715,King Lear,94.0,5.3.313,KING LEAR,It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
52715,52716,King Lear,94.0,5.3.314,KING LEAR,That ever I have felt.
52716,52717,King Lear,95.0,5.3.315,KENT,[Kneeling]  O my good master!
52717,52718,King Lear,96.0,5.3.316,KING LEAR,"Prithee, away."
52718,52719,King Lear,97.0,5.3.317,EDGAR,"'Tis noble Kent, your friend."
52719,52720,King Lear,98.0,5.3.318,KING LEAR,"A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!"
52720,52721,King Lear,98.0,5.3.319,KING LEAR,"I might have saved her, now she's gone for ever!"
52721,52722,King Lear,98.0,5.3.320,KING LEAR,"Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!"
52722,52723,King Lear,98.0,5.3.321,KING LEAR,"What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,"
52723,52724,King Lear,98.0,5.3.322,KING LEAR,"Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman."
52724,52725,King Lear,98.0,5.3.323,KING LEAR,I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
52725,52726,King Lear,99.0,5.3.324,Captain,"'Tis true, my lords, he did."
52726,52727,King Lear,100.0,5.3.325,KING LEAR,"Did I not, fellow?"
52727,52728,King Lear,100.0,5.3.326,KING LEAR,"I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion"
52728,52729,King Lear,100.0,5.3.327,KING LEAR,"I would have made them skip: I am old now,"
52729,52730,King Lear,100.0,5.3.328,KING LEAR,And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
52730,52731,King Lear,100.0,5.3.329,KING LEAR,Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
52731,52732,King Lear,101.0,5.3.330,KENT,"If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,"
52732,52733,King Lear,101.0,5.3.331,KENT,One of them we behold.
52733,52734,King Lear,102.0,5.3.332,KING LEAR,This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
52734,52735,King Lear,103.0,5.3.333,KENT,"The same,"
52735,52736,King Lear,103.0,5.3.334,KENT,Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
52736,52737,King Lear,104.0,5.3.335,KING LEAR,"He's a good fellow, I can tell you that,"
52737,52738,King Lear,104.0,5.3.336,KING LEAR,"He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten."
52738,52739,King Lear,105.0,5.3.337,KENT,"No, my good lord, I am the very man,--"
52739,52740,King Lear,106.0,5.3.338,KING LEAR,I'll see that straight.
52740,52741,King Lear,107.0,5.3.339,KENT,"That, from your first of difference and decay,"
52741,52742,King Lear,107.0,5.3.340,KENT,Have follow'd your sad steps.
52742,52743,King Lear,108.0,5.3.341,KING LEAR,You are welcome hither.
52743,52744,King Lear,109.0,5.3.342,KENT,"Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly."
52744,52745,King Lear,109.0,5.3.343,KENT,"Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,"
52745,52746,King Lear,109.0,5.3.344,KENT,And desperately are dead.
52746,52747,King Lear,110.0,5.3.345,KING LEAR,"Ay, so I think."
52747,52748,King Lear,111.0,5.3.346,ALBANY,He knows not what he says: and vain it is
52748,52749,King Lear,111.0,5.3.347,ALBANY,That we present us to him.
52749,52750,King Lear,112.0,5.3.348,EDGAR,Very bootless.
52750,52751,King Lear,112.0,,EDGAR,Enter a Captain
52751,52752,King Lear,113.0,5.3.349,Captain,"Edmund is dead, my lord."
52752,52753,King Lear,114.0,5.3.350,ALBANY,That's but a trifle here.
52753,52754,King Lear,114.0,5.3.351,ALBANY,"You lords and noble friends, know our intent."
52754,52755,King Lear,114.0,5.3.352,ALBANY,What comfort to this great decay may come
52755,52756,King Lear,114.0,5.3.353,ALBANY,"Shall be applied: for us we will resign,"

52761,52762,King Lear,114.0,5.3.358,ALBANY,Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
52762,52763,King Lear,114.0,5.3.359,ALBANY,"The wages of their virtue, and all foes"
52763,52764,King Lear,114.0,5.3.360,ALBANY,"The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!"
52764,52765,King Lear,115.0,5.3.361,KING LEAR,"And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!"
52765,52766,King Lear,115.0,5.3.362,KING LEAR,"Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,"
52766,52767,King Lear,115.0,5.3.363,KING LEAR,"And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,"

52768,52769,King Lear,115.0,5.3.365,KING LEAR,"Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir."
52769,52770,King Lear,115.0,5.3.366,KING LEAR,"Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,"
52770,52771,King Lear,115.0,5.3.367,KING LEAR,"Look there, look there!"

52776,52777,King Lear,119.0,5.3.372,KENT,That would upon the rack of this tough world

52778,52779,King Lear,120.0,5.3.374,EDGAR,"He is gone, indeed."
52779,52780,King Lear,121.0,5.3.375,KENT,"The wonder is, he hath endured so long:"
52780,52781,King Lear,121.0,5.3.376,KENT,He but usurp'd his life.
52781,52782,King Lear,122.0,5.3.377,ALBANY,Bear them from hence. Our present business
52782,52783,King Lear,122.0,5.3.378,ALBANY,Is general woe.

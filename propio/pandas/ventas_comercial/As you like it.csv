15745,15746,As you like it,114.0,,KING,Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
15746,15747,As you like it,1.0,1.1.1,ORLANDO,"As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion"
15747,15748,As you like it,1.0,1.1.2,ORLANDO,"bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,"
15748,15749,As you like it,1.0,1.1.3,ORLANDO,"and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his"
15749,15750,As you like it,1.0,1.1.4,ORLANDO,"blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my"
15750,15751,As you like it,1.0,1.1.5,ORLANDO,"sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and"
15751,15752,As you like it,1.0,1.1.6,ORLANDO,"report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,"
15752,15753,As you like it,1.0,1.1.7,ORLANDO,"he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more"
15753,15754,As you like it,1.0,1.1.8,ORLANDO,"properly, stays me here at home unkept, for call you"
15754,15755,As you like it,1.0,1.1.9,ORLANDO,"that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that"
15755,15756,As you like it,1.0,1.1.10,ORLANDO,differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
15756,15757,As you like it,1.0,1.1.11,ORLANDO,"are bred better, for, besides that they are fair"
15757,15758,As you like it,1.0,1.1.12,ORLANDO,"with their feeding, they are taught their manage,"
15758,15759,As you like it,1.0,1.1.13,ORLANDO,"and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his"
15759,15760,As you like it,1.0,1.1.14,ORLANDO,"brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the"
15760,15761,As you like it,1.0,1.1.15,ORLANDO,which his animals on his dunghills are as much
15761,15762,As you like it,1.0,1.1.16,ORLANDO,bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
15762,15763,As you like it,1.0,1.1.17,ORLANDO,"plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave"
15763,15764,As you like it,1.0,1.1.18,ORLANDO,me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
15764,15765,As you like it,1.0,1.1.19,ORLANDO,"me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a"
15765,15766,As you like it,1.0,1.1.20,ORLANDO,"brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my"
15766,15767,As you like it,1.0,1.1.21,ORLANDO,"gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that"
15767,15768,As you like it,1.0,1.1.22,ORLANDO,"grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I"
15768,15769,As you like it,1.0,1.1.23,ORLANDO,"think is within me, begins to mutiny against this"
15769,15770,As you like it,1.0,1.1.24,ORLANDO,"servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I"
15770,15771,As you like it,1.0,1.1.25,ORLANDO,know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
15771,15772,As you like it,2.0,1.1.26,ADAM,"Yonder comes my master, your brother."
15772,15773,As you like it,3.0,1.1.27,ORLANDO,"Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will"
15773,15774,As you like it,3.0,1.1.28,ORLANDO,shake me up.

15776,15777,As you like it,5.0,1.1.30,ORLANDO,Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
15777,15778,As you like it,6.0,1.1.31,OLIVER,"What mar you then, sir?"
15778,15779,As you like it,7.0,1.1.32,ORLANDO,"Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God"
15779,15780,As you like it,7.0,1.1.33,ORLANDO,"made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness."
15780,15781,As you like it,8.0,1.1.34,OLIVER,"Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile."
15781,15782,As you like it,9.0,1.1.35,ORLANDO,Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
15782,15783,As you like it,9.0,1.1.36,ORLANDO,"What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should"
15783,15784,As you like it,9.0,1.1.37,ORLANDO,come to such penury?
15784,15785,As you like it,10.0,1.1.38,OLIVER,"Know you where your are, sir?"
15785,15786,As you like it,11.0,1.1.39,ORLANDO,"O, sir, very well, here in your orchard."

15787,15788,As you like it,13.0,1.1.41,ORLANDO,"Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know"
15788,15789,As you like it,13.0,1.1.42,ORLANDO,"you are my eldest brother, and, in the gentle"
15789,15790,As you like it,13.0,1.1.43,ORLANDO,"condition of blood, you should so know me. The"
15790,15791,As you like it,13.0,1.1.44,ORLANDO,"courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that"
15791,15792,As you like it,13.0,1.1.45,ORLANDO,"you are the first-born, but the same tradition"
15792,15793,As you like it,13.0,1.1.46,ORLANDO,"takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers"
15793,15794,As you like it,13.0,1.1.47,ORLANDO,betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
15794,15795,As you like it,13.0,1.1.48,ORLANDO,"you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is"
15795,15796,As you like it,13.0,1.1.49,ORLANDO,nearer to his reverence.
15796,15797,As you like it,14.0,1.1.50,OLIVER,"What, boy!"
15797,15798,As you like it,15.0,1.1.51,ORLANDO,"Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this."
15798,15799,As you like it,16.0,1.1.52,OLIVER,"Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?"
15799,15800,As you like it,17.0,1.1.53,ORLANDO,"I am no villain, I am the youngest son of Sir"
15800,15801,As you like it,17.0,1.1.54,ORLANDO,"Rowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is thrice"
15801,15802,As you like it,17.0,1.1.55,ORLANDO,a villain that says such a father begot villains.
15802,15803,As you like it,17.0,1.1.56,ORLANDO,"Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand"
15803,15804,As you like it,17.0,1.1.57,ORLANDO,from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
15804,15805,As you like it,17.0,1.1.58,ORLANDO,tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
15805,15806,As you like it,18.0,1.1.59,ADAM,"Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's"
15806,15807,As you like it,18.0,1.1.60,ADAM,"remembrance, be at accord."
15807,15808,As you like it,19.0,1.1.61,OLIVER,"Let me go, I say."
15808,15809,As you like it,20.0,1.1.62,ORLANDO,"I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My"
15809,15810,As you like it,20.0,1.1.63,ORLANDO,father charged you in his will to give me good
15810,15811,As you like it,20.0,1.1.64,ORLANDO,"education: you have trained me like a peasant,"
15811,15812,As you like it,20.0,1.1.65,ORLANDO,obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
15812,15813,As you like it,20.0,1.1.66,ORLANDO,qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
15813,15814,As you like it,20.0,1.1.67,ORLANDO,"me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow"
15814,15815,As you like it,20.0,1.1.68,ORLANDO,"me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or"
15815,15816,As you like it,20.0,1.1.69,ORLANDO,give me the poor allottery my father left me by
15816,15817,As you like it,20.0,1.1.70,ORLANDO,"testament, with that I will go buy my fortunes."
15817,15818,As you like it,21.0,1.1.71,OLIVER,"And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?"
15818,15819,As you like it,21.0,1.1.72,OLIVER,"Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled"
15819,15820,As you like it,21.0,1.1.73,OLIVER,"with you, you shall have some part of your will: I"
15820,15821,As you like it,21.0,1.1.74,OLIVER,"pray you, leave me."
15821,15822,As you like it,22.0,1.1.75,ORLANDO,I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
15822,15823,As you like it,23.0,1.1.76,OLIVER,"Get you with him, you old dog."
15823,15824,As you like it,24.0,1.1.77,ADAM,"Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my"
15824,15825,As you like it,24.0,1.1.78,ADAM,teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
15825,15826,As you like it,24.0,1.1.79,ADAM,he would not have spoke such a word.
15826,15827,As you like it,24.0,,ADAM,Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
15827,15828,As you like it,25.0,1.1.80,OLIVER,Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
15828,15829,As you like it,25.0,1.1.81,OLIVER,"physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand"
15829,15830,As you like it,25.0,1.1.82,OLIVER,"crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!"

15841,15842,As you like it,31.0,1.1.91,OLIVER,new court?
15842,15843,As you like it,32.0,1.1.92,CHARLES,"There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:"
15843,15844,As you like it,32.0,1.1.93,CHARLES,"that is, the old duke is banished by his younger"
15844,15845,As you like it,32.0,1.1.94,CHARLES,"brother the new duke, and three or four loving lords"

15846,15847,As you like it,32.0,1.1.96,CHARLES,"whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke,"
15847,15848,As you like it,32.0,1.1.97,CHARLES,therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

15851,15852,As you like it,34.0,1.1.101,CHARLES,"her, being ever from their cradles bred together,"
15852,15853,As you like it,34.0,1.1.102,CHARLES,"that she would have followed her exile, or have died"
15853,15854,As you like it,34.0,1.1.103,CHARLES,"to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no"
15854,15855,As you like it,34.0,1.1.104,CHARLES,"less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and"
15855,15856,As you like it,34.0,1.1.105,CHARLES,never two ladies loved as they do.
15856,15857,As you like it,35.0,1.1.106,OLIVER,Where will the old duke live?
15857,15858,As you like it,36.0,1.1.107,CHARLES,"They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and"
15858,15859,As you like it,36.0,1.1.108,CHARLES,"a many merry men with him, and there they live like"
15859,15860,As you like it,36.0,1.1.109,CHARLES,the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young

15863,15864,As you like it,38.0,1.1.113,CHARLES,"Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a"
15864,15865,As you like it,38.0,1.1.114,CHARLES,"matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand"
15865,15866,As you like it,38.0,1.1.115,CHARLES,that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
15866,15867,As you like it,38.0,1.1.116,CHARLES,to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
15867,15868,As you like it,38.0,1.1.117,CHARLES,"To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that"
15868,15869,As you like it,38.0,1.1.118,CHARLES,escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
15869,15870,As you like it,38.0,1.1.119,CHARLES,"well. Your brother is but young and tender, and,"
15870,15871,As you like it,38.0,1.1.120,CHARLES,"for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I"
15871,15872,As you like it,38.0,1.1.121,CHARLES,"must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,"
15872,15873,As you like it,38.0,1.1.122,CHARLES,"out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you"
15873,15874,As you like it,38.0,1.1.123,CHARLES,"withal, that either you might stay him from his"
15874,15875,As you like it,38.0,1.1.124,CHARLES,intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
15875,15876,As you like it,38.0,1.1.125,CHARLES,"run into, in that it is a thing of his own search"
15876,15877,As you like it,38.0,1.1.126,CHARLES,and altogether against my will.
15877,15878,As you like it,39.0,1.1.127,OLIVER,"Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which"
15878,15879,As you like it,39.0,1.1.128,OLIVER,thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
15879,15880,As you like it,39.0,1.1.129,OLIVER,myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
15880,15881,As you like it,39.0,1.1.130,OLIVER,have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
15881,15882,As you like it,39.0,1.1.131,OLIVER,"it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:"
15882,15883,As you like it,39.0,1.1.132,OLIVER,"it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full"
15883,15884,As you like it,39.0,1.1.133,OLIVER,"of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's"
15884,15885,As you like it,39.0,1.1.134,OLIVER,"good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against"
15885,15886,As you like it,39.0,1.1.135,OLIVER,me his natural brother: therefore use thy
15886,15887,As you like it,39.0,1.1.136,OLIVER,"discretion, I had as lief thou didst break his neck"
15887,15888,As you like it,39.0,1.1.137,OLIVER,"as his finger. And thou wert best look to't, for if"
15888,15889,As you like it,39.0,1.1.138,OLIVER,thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
15889,15890,As you like it,39.0,1.1.139,OLIVER,"mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise"
15890,15891,As you like it,39.0,1.1.140,OLIVER,"against thee by poison, entrap thee by some"
15891,15892,As you like it,39.0,1.1.141,OLIVER,treacherous device and never leave thee till he
15892,15893,As you like it,39.0,1.1.142,OLIVER,"hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other,"
15893,15894,As you like it,39.0,1.1.143,OLIVER,"for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak"
15894,15895,As you like it,39.0,1.1.144,OLIVER,"it, there is not one so young and so villanous this"
15895,15896,As you like it,39.0,1.1.145,OLIVER,"day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but"
15896,15897,As you like it,39.0,1.1.146,OLIVER,"should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must"
15897,15898,As you like it,39.0,1.1.147,OLIVER,blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
15898,15899,As you like it,40.0,1.1.148,CHARLES,I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
15899,15900,As you like it,40.0,1.1.149,CHARLES,"to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go"
15900,15901,As you like it,40.0,1.1.150,CHARLES,"alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and"
15901,15902,As you like it,40.0,1.1.151,CHARLES,so God keep your worship!
15902,15903,As you like it,41.0,1.1.152,OLIVER,"Farewell, good Charles."

15904,15905,As you like it,41.0,1.1.153,OLIVER,Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see

15906,15907,As you like it,41.0,1.1.155,OLIVER,"hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never"
15907,15908,As you like it,41.0,1.1.156,OLIVER,"schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of"
15908,15909,As you like it,41.0,1.1.157,OLIVER,"all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much"
15909,15910,As you like it,41.0,1.1.158,OLIVER,"in the heart of the world, and especially of my own"
15910,15911,As you like it,41.0,1.1.159,OLIVER,"people, who best know him, that I am altogether"

15919,15920,As you like it,2.0,1.2.3,ROSALIND,and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could

15921,15922,As you like it,2.0,1.2.5,ROSALIND,learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
15922,15923,As you like it,3.0,1.2.6,CELIA,Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
15923,15924,As you like it,3.0,1.2.7,CELIA,"that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,"

15927,15928,As you like it,3.0,1.2.11,CELIA,if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
15928,15929,As you like it,3.0,1.2.12,CELIA,tempered as mine is to thee.
15929,15930,As you like it,4.0,1.2.13,ROSALIND,"Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to"
15930,15931,As you like it,4.0,1.2.14,ROSALIND,rejoice in yours.

15940,15941,As you like it,7.0,1.2.24,CELIA,"Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but"

15944,15945,As you like it,8.0,1.2.28,ROSALIND,"What shall be our sport, then?"
15945,15946,As you like it,9.0,1.2.29,CELIA,Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from

15947,15948,As you like it,10.0,1.2.31,ROSALIND,"I would we could do so, for her benefits are"
15948,15949,As you like it,10.0,1.2.32,ROSALIND,"mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman"
15949,15950,As you like it,10.0,1.2.33,ROSALIND,doth most mistake in her gifts to women.

15958,15959,As you like it,13.0,1.2.41,CELIA,not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature

15960,15961,As you like it,13.0,1.2.43,CELIA,Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

15973,15974,As you like it,19.0,1.2.56,ROSALIND,"Where learned you that oath, fool?"
15974,15975,As you like it,20.0,1.2.57,TOUCHSTONE,Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
15975,15976,As you like it,20.0,1.2.58,TOUCHSTONE,were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
15976,15977,As you like it,20.0,1.2.59,TOUCHSTONE,"mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the"
15977,15978,As you like it,20.0,1.2.60,TOUCHSTONE,"pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and"
15978,15979,As you like it,20.0,1.2.61,TOUCHSTONE,yet was not the knight forsworn.
15979,15980,As you like it,21.0,1.2.62,CELIA,"How prove you that, in the great heap of your"

15987,15988,As you like it,25.0,1.2.70,TOUCHSTONE,"more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he"
15988,15989,As you like it,25.0,1.2.71,TOUCHSTONE,"never had any, or if he had, he had sworn it away"
15989,15990,As you like it,25.0,1.2.72,TOUCHSTONE,before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
15990,15991,As you like it,26.0,1.2.73,CELIA,"Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?"
15991,15992,As you like it,27.0,1.2.74,TOUCHSTONE,"One that old Frederick, your father, loves."
15992,15993,As you like it,28.0,1.2.75,CELIA,My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!

15999,16000,As you like it,30.0,1.2.82,CELIA,that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
16000,16001,As you like it,30.0,1.2.83,CELIA,Monsieur Le Beau.
16001,16002,As you like it,31.0,1.2.84,ROSALIND,With his mouth full of news.
16002,16003,As you like it,32.0,1.2.85,CELIA,"Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young."
16003,16004,As you like it,33.0,1.2.86,ROSALIND,Then shall we be news-crammed.
16004,16005,As you like it,34.0,1.2.87,CELIA,"All the better, we shall be the more marketable."
16005,16006,As you like it,34.0,,CELIA,Enter LE BEAU
16006,16007,As you like it,34.0,1.2.88,CELIA,"Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?"
16007,16008,As you like it,35.0,1.2.89,LE BEAU,"Fair princess, you have lost much good sport."
16008,16009,As you like it,36.0,1.2.90,CELIA,Sport! of what colour?
16009,16010,As you like it,37.0,1.2.91,LE BEAU,"What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?"
16010,16011,As you like it,38.0,1.2.92,ROSALIND,As wit and fortune will.
16011,16012,As you like it,39.0,1.2.93,TOUCHSTONE,Or as the Destinies decree.
16012,16013,As you like it,40.0,1.2.94,CELIA,Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
16013,16014,As you like it,41.0,1.2.95,TOUCHSTONE,"Nay, if I keep not my rank,--"
16014,16015,As you like it,42.0,1.2.96,ROSALIND,Thou losest thy old smell.
16015,16016,As you like it,43.0,1.2.97,LE BEAU,"You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good"
16016,16017,As you like it,43.0,1.2.98,LE BEAU,"wrestling, which you have lost the sight of."
16017,16018,As you like it,44.0,1.2.99,ROSALIND,You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
16018,16019,As you like it,45.0,1.2.100,LE BEAU,"I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please"
16019,16020,As you like it,45.0,1.2.101,LE BEAU,"your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is"
16020,16021,As you like it,45.0,1.2.102,LE BEAU,"yet to do, and here, where you are, they are coming"
16021,16022,As you like it,45.0,1.2.103,LE BEAU,to perform it.
16022,16023,As you like it,46.0,1.2.104,CELIA,"Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried."
16023,16024,As you like it,47.0,1.2.105,LE BEAU,"There comes an old man and his three sons,--"
16024,16025,As you like it,48.0,1.2.106,CELIA,I could match this beginning with an old tale.
16025,16026,As you like it,49.0,1.2.107,LE BEAU,"Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence."
16026,16027,As you like it,50.0,1.2.108,ROSALIND,"With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men"

16032,16033,As you like it,51.0,1.2.114,LE BEAU,"so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man,"
16033,16034,As you like it,51.0,1.2.115,LE BEAU,"their father, making such pitiful dole over them"
16034,16035,As you like it,51.0,1.2.116,LE BEAU,that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
16035,16036,As you like it,52.0,1.2.117,ROSALIND,Alas!
16036,16037,As you like it,53.0,1.2.118,TOUCHSTONE,"But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies"
16037,16038,As you like it,53.0,1.2.119,TOUCHSTONE,have lost?
16038,16039,As you like it,54.0,1.2.120,LE BEAU,"Why, this that I speak of."
16039,16040,As you like it,55.0,1.2.121,TOUCHSTONE,Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
16040,16041,As you like it,55.0,1.2.122,TOUCHSTONE,time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
16041,16042,As you like it,55.0,1.2.123,TOUCHSTONE,for ladies.
16042,16043,As you like it,56.0,1.2.124,CELIA,"Or I, I promise thee."
16043,16044,As you like it,57.0,1.2.125,ROSALIND,But is there any else longs to see this broken music
16044,16045,As you like it,57.0,1.2.126,ROSALIND,in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
16045,16046,As you like it,57.0,1.2.127,ROSALIND,"rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?"
16046,16047,As you like it,58.0,1.2.128,LE BEAU,"You must, if you stay here, for here is the place"
16047,16048,As you like it,58.0,1.2.129,LE BEAU,"appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to"
16048,16049,As you like it,58.0,1.2.130,LE BEAU,perform it.
16049,16050,As you like it,59.0,1.2.131,CELIA,"Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it."
16050,16051,As you like it,59.0,,CELIA,"Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants"

16053,16054,As you like it,61.0,1.2.134,ROSALIND,Is yonder the man?
16054,16055,As you like it,62.0,1.2.135,LE BEAU,"Even he, madam."
16055,16056,As you like it,63.0,1.2.136,CELIA,"Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully."
16056,16057,As you like it,64.0,1.2.137,DUKE FREDERICK,"How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither"
16057,16058,As you like it,64.0,1.2.138,DUKE FREDERICK,to see the wrestling?
16058,16059,As you like it,65.0,1.2.139,ROSALIND,"Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave."

16060,16061,As you like it,66.0,1.2.141,DUKE FREDERICK,there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
16061,16062,As you like it,66.0,1.2.142,DUKE FREDERICK,"challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he"
16062,16063,As you like it,66.0,1.2.143,DUKE FREDERICK,"will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies, see if"
16063,16064,As you like it,66.0,1.2.144,DUKE FREDERICK,you can move him.
16064,16065,As you like it,67.0,1.2.145,CELIA,"Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau."
16065,16066,As you like it,68.0,1.2.146,DUKE FREDERICK,Do so: I'll not be by.
16066,16067,As you like it,69.0,1.2.147,LE BEAU,"Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you."
16067,16068,As you like it,70.0,1.2.148,ORLANDO,I attend them with all respect and duty.
16068,16069,As you like it,71.0,1.2.149,ROSALIND,"Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?"
16069,16070,As you like it,72.0,1.2.150,ORLANDO,"No, fair princess, he is the general challenger: I"

16078,16079,As you like it,73.0,1.2.159,CELIA,embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

16080,16081,As you like it,74.0,1.2.161,ROSALIND,be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke

16092,16093,As you like it,75.0,1.2.173,ORLANDO,supplied when I have made it empty.
16093,16094,As you like it,76.0,1.2.174,ROSALIND,"The little strength that I have, I would it were with you."
16094,16095,As you like it,77.0,1.2.175,CELIA,"And mine, to eke out hers."
16095,16096,As you like it,78.0,1.2.176,ROSALIND,Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
16096,16097,As you like it,79.0,1.2.177,CELIA,Your heart's desires be with you!
16097,16098,As you like it,80.0,1.2.178,CHARLES,"Come, where is this young gallant that is so"
16098,16099,As you like it,80.0,1.2.179,CHARLES,desirous to lie with his mother earth?
16099,16100,As you like it,81.0,1.2.180,ORLANDO,"Ready, sir, but his will hath in it a more modest working."
16100,16101,As you like it,82.0,1.2.181,DUKE FREDERICK,You shall try but one fall.
16101,16102,As you like it,83.0,1.2.182,CHARLES,"No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him"
16102,16103,As you like it,83.0,1.2.183,CHARLES,"to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him"
16103,16104,As you like it,83.0,1.2.184,CHARLES,from a first.
16104,16105,As you like it,84.0,1.2.185,ORLANDO,"An you mean to mock me after, you should not have"
16105,16106,As you like it,84.0,1.2.186,ORLANDO,mocked me before: but come your ways.
16106,16107,As you like it,85.0,1.2.187,ROSALIND,"Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!"
16107,16108,As you like it,86.0,1.2.188,CELIA,"I would I were invisible, to catch the strong"
16108,16109,As you like it,86.0,1.2.189,CELIA,fellow by the leg.
16109,16110,As you like it,86.0,,CELIA,They wrestle
16110,16111,As you like it,87.0,1.2.190,ROSALIND,O excellent young man!
16111,16112,As you like it,88.0,1.2.191,CELIA,"If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who"
16112,16113,As you like it,88.0,1.2.192,CELIA,should down.
16113,16114,As you like it,88.0,,CELIA,Shout. CHARLES is thrown
16114,16115,As you like it,89.0,1.2.193,DUKE FREDERICK,"No more, no more."
16115,16116,As you like it,90.0,1.2.194,ORLANDO,"Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed."
16116,16117,As you like it,91.0,1.2.195,DUKE FREDERICK,"How dost thou, Charles?"
16117,16118,As you like it,92.0,1.2.196,LE BEAU,"He cannot speak, my lord."
16118,16119,As you like it,93.0,1.2.197,DUKE FREDERICK,"Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?"
16119,16120,As you like it,94.0,1.2.198,ORLANDO,"Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys."
16120,16121,As you like it,95.0,1.2.199,DUKE FREDERICK,I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
16121,16122,As you like it,95.0,1.2.200,DUKE FREDERICK,"The world esteem'd thy father honourable,"
16122,16123,As you like it,95.0,1.2.201,DUKE FREDERICK,But I did find him still mine enemy:
16123,16124,As you like it,95.0,1.2.202,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,"
16124,16125,As you like it,95.0,1.2.203,DUKE FREDERICK,Hadst thou descended from another house.
16125,16126,As you like it,95.0,1.2.204,DUKE FREDERICK,"But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth:"
16126,16127,As you like it,95.0,1.2.205,DUKE FREDERICK,I would thou hadst told me of another father.
16127,16128,As you like it,95.0,,DUKE FREDERICK,"Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU"
16128,16129,As you like it,96.0,1.2.206,CELIA,"Were I my father, coz, would I do this?"
16129,16130,As you like it,97.0,1.2.207,ORLANDO,"I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,"
16130,16131,As you like it,97.0,1.2.208,ORLANDO,"His youngest son, and would not change that calling,"
16131,16132,As you like it,97.0,1.2.209,ORLANDO,To be adopted heir to Frederick.
16132,16133,As you like it,98.0,1.2.210,ROSALIND,"My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,"
16133,16134,As you like it,98.0,1.2.211,ROSALIND,And all the world was of my father's mind:
16134,16135,As you like it,98.0,1.2.212,ROSALIND,"Had I before known this young man his son,"
16135,16136,As you like it,98.0,1.2.213,ROSALIND,"I should have given him tears unto entreaties,"
16136,16137,As you like it,98.0,1.2.214,ROSALIND,Ere he should thus have ventured.
16137,16138,As you like it,99.0,1.2.215,CELIA,"Gentle cousin,"
16138,16139,As you like it,99.0,1.2.216,CELIA,Let us go thank him and encourage him:
16139,16140,As you like it,99.0,1.2.217,CELIA,My father's rough and envious disposition
16140,16141,As you like it,99.0,1.2.218,CELIA,"Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:"
16141,16142,As you like it,99.0,1.2.219,CELIA,If you do keep your promises in love
16142,16143,As you like it,99.0,1.2.220,CELIA,"But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,"
16143,16144,As you like it,99.0,1.2.221,CELIA,Your mistress shall be happy.
16144,16145,As you like it,100.0,1.2.222,ROSALIND,"Gentleman,"
16145,16146,As you like it,100.0,,ROSALIND,Giving him a chain from her neck
16146,16147,As you like it,100.0,1.2.223,ROSALIND,"Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,"
16147,16148,As you like it,100.0,1.2.224,ROSALIND,"That could give more, but that her hand lacks means."
16148,16149,As you like it,100.0,1.2.225,ROSALIND,"Shall we go, coz?"
16149,16150,As you like it,101.0,1.2.226,CELIA,"Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman."
16150,16151,As you like it,102.0,1.2.227,ORLANDO,"Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts"
16151,16152,As you like it,102.0,1.2.228,ORLANDO,"Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up"
16152,16153,As you like it,102.0,1.2.229,ORLANDO,"Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block."
16153,16154,As you like it,103.0,1.2.230,ROSALIND,"He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes,"
16154,16155,As you like it,103.0,1.2.231,ROSALIND,"I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?"
16155,16156,As you like it,103.0,1.2.232,ROSALIND,"Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown"
16156,16157,As you like it,103.0,1.2.233,ROSALIND,More than your enemies.
16157,16158,As you like it,104.0,1.2.234,CELIA,"Will you go, coz?"
16158,16159,As you like it,105.0,1.2.235,ROSALIND,Have with you. Fare you well.
16159,16160,As you like it,105.0,,ROSALIND,Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
16160,16161,As you like it,106.0,1.2.236,ORLANDO,What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
16161,16162,As you like it,106.0,1.2.237,ORLANDO,"I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference."
16162,16163,As you like it,106.0,1.2.238,ORLANDO,"O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!"
16163,16164,As you like it,106.0,1.2.239,ORLANDO,Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
16164,16165,As you like it,106.0,,ORLANDO,Re-enter LE BEAU
16165,16166,As you like it,107.0,1.2.240,LE BEAU,"Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you"
16166,16167,As you like it,107.0,1.2.241,LE BEAU,To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
16167,16168,As you like it,107.0,1.2.242,LE BEAU,"High commendation, true applause and love,"
16168,16169,As you like it,107.0,1.2.243,LE BEAU,Yet such is now the duke's condition
16169,16170,As you like it,107.0,1.2.244,LE BEAU,That he misconstrues all that you have done.
16170,16171,As you like it,107.0,1.2.245,LE BEAU,"The duke is humorous, what he is indeed,"
16171,16172,As you like it,107.0,1.2.246,LE BEAU,More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
16172,16173,As you like it,108.0,1.2.247,ORLANDO,"I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:"
16173,16174,As you like it,108.0,1.2.248,ORLANDO,Which of the two was daughter of the duke
16174,16175,As you like it,108.0,1.2.249,ORLANDO,That here was at the wrestling?
16175,16176,As you like it,109.0,1.2.250,LE BEAU,"Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,"
16176,16177,As you like it,109.0,1.2.251,LE BEAU,But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
16177,16178,As you like it,109.0,1.2.252,LE BEAU,"The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,"
16178,16179,As you like it,109.0,1.2.253,LE BEAU,"And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,"
16179,16180,As you like it,109.0,1.2.254,LE BEAU,"To keep his daughter company, whose loves"
16180,16181,As you like it,109.0,1.2.255,LE BEAU,Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
16181,16182,As you like it,109.0,1.2.256,LE BEAU,But I can tell you that of late this duke
16182,16183,As you like it,109.0,1.2.257,LE BEAU,"Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,"
16183,16184,As you like it,109.0,1.2.258,LE BEAU,Grounded upon no other argument
16184,16185,As you like it,109.0,1.2.259,LE BEAU,But that the people praise her for her virtues
16185,16186,As you like it,109.0,1.2.260,LE BEAU,"And pity her for her good father's sake,"
16186,16187,As you like it,109.0,1.2.261,LE BEAU,"And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady"
16187,16188,As you like it,109.0,1.2.262,LE BEAU,"Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:"
16188,16189,As you like it,109.0,1.2.263,LE BEAU,"Hereafter, in a better world than this,"
16189,16190,As you like it,109.0,1.2.264,LE BEAU,I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
16190,16191,As you like it,110.0,1.2.265,ORLANDO,I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
16191,16192,As you like it,110.0,,ORLANDO,Exit LE BEAU
16192,16193,As you like it,110.0,1.2.266,ORLANDO,"Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,"
16193,16194,As you like it,110.0,1.2.267,ORLANDO,From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
16194,16195,As you like it,110.0,1.2.268,ORLANDO,But heavenly Rosalind!
16195,16196,As you like it,110.0,,ORLANDO,Exit
16196,16197,As you like it,110.0,,ORLANDO,SCENE III. A room in the palace.
16197,16198,As you like it,110.0,,ORLANDO,Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
16198,16199,As you like it,1.0,1.3.1,CELIA,"Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?"
16199,16200,As you like it,2.0,1.3.2,ROSALIND,Not one to throw at a dog.
16200,16201,As you like it,3.0,1.3.3,CELIA,"No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon"
16201,16202,As you like it,3.0,1.3.4,CELIA,"curs, throw some of them at me, come, lame me with reasons."
16202,16203,As you like it,4.0,1.3.5,ROSALIND,"Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one"
16203,16204,As you like it,4.0,1.3.6,ROSALIND,should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
16204,16205,As you like it,4.0,1.3.7,ROSALIND,without any.
16205,16206,As you like it,5.0,1.3.8,CELIA,But is all this for your father?
16206,16207,As you like it,6.0,1.3.9,ROSALIND,"No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how"
16207,16208,As you like it,6.0,1.3.10,ROSALIND,full of briers is this working-day world!
16208,16209,As you like it,7.0,1.3.11,CELIA,"They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in"
16209,16210,As you like it,7.0,1.3.12,CELIA,holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
16210,16211,As you like it,7.0,1.3.13,CELIA,paths our very petticoats will catch them.
16211,16212,As you like it,8.0,1.3.14,ROSALIND,I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
16212,16213,As you like it,9.0,1.3.15,CELIA,Hem them away.
16213,16214,As you like it,10.0,1.3.16,ROSALIND,"I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him."
16214,16215,As you like it,11.0,1.3.17,CELIA,"Come, come, wrestle with thy affections."
16215,16216,As you like it,12.0,1.3.18,ROSALIND,"O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!"
16216,16217,As you like it,13.0,1.3.19,CELIA,"O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in"
16217,16218,As you like it,13.0,1.3.20,CELIA,"despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of"
16218,16219,As you like it,13.0,1.3.21,CELIA,"service, let us talk in good earnest: is it"
16219,16220,As you like it,13.0,1.3.22,CELIA,"possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so"
16220,16221,As you like it,13.0,1.3.23,CELIA,strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
16221,16222,As you like it,14.0,1.3.24,ROSALIND,The duke my father loved his father dearly.
16222,16223,As you like it,15.0,1.3.25,CELIA,Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
16223,16224,As you like it,15.0,1.3.26,CELIA,"dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,"
16224,16225,As you like it,15.0,1.3.27,CELIA,"for my father hated his father dearly, yet I hate"
16225,16226,As you like it,15.0,1.3.28,CELIA,not Orlando.
16226,16227,As you like it,16.0,1.3.29,ROSALIND,"No, faith, hate him not, for my sake."
16227,16228,As you like it,17.0,1.3.30,CELIA,Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
16228,16229,As you like it,18.0,1.3.31,ROSALIND,"Let me love him for that, and do you love him"
16229,16230,As you like it,18.0,1.3.32,ROSALIND,"because I do. Look, here comes the duke."
16230,16231,As you like it,19.0,1.3.33,CELIA,With his eyes full of anger.
16231,16232,As you like it,19.0,,CELIA,"Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords"
16232,16233,As you like it,20.0,1.3.34,DUKE FREDERICK,"Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste"
16233,16234,As you like it,20.0,1.3.35,DUKE FREDERICK,And get you from our court.
16234,16235,As you like it,21.0,1.3.36,ROSALIND,"Me, uncle?"
16235,16236,As you like it,22.0,1.3.37,DUKE FREDERICK,"You, cousin"
16236,16237,As you like it,22.0,1.3.38,DUKE FREDERICK,Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
16237,16238,As you like it,22.0,1.3.39,DUKE FREDERICK,"So near our public court as twenty miles,"
16238,16239,As you like it,22.0,1.3.40,DUKE FREDERICK,Thou diest for it.
16239,16240,As you like it,23.0,1.3.41,ROSALIND,"I do beseech your grace,"
16240,16241,As you like it,23.0,1.3.42,ROSALIND,Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
16241,16242,As you like it,23.0,1.3.43,ROSALIND,If with myself I hold intelligence
16242,16243,As you like it,23.0,1.3.44,ROSALIND,"Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,"
16243,16244,As you like it,23.0,1.3.45,ROSALIND,"If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--"
16244,16245,As you like it,23.0,1.3.46,ROSALIND,"As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,"
16245,16246,As you like it,23.0,1.3.47,ROSALIND,Never so much as in a thought unborn
16246,16247,As you like it,23.0,1.3.48,ROSALIND,Did I offend your highness.
16247,16248,As you like it,24.0,1.3.49,DUKE FREDERICK,Thus do all traitors:
16248,16249,As you like it,24.0,1.3.50,DUKE FREDERICK,"If their purgation did consist in words,"
16249,16250,As you like it,24.0,1.3.51,DUKE FREDERICK,They are as innocent as grace itself:
16250,16251,As you like it,24.0,1.3.52,DUKE FREDERICK,Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
16251,16252,As you like it,25.0,1.3.53,ROSALIND,Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
16252,16253,As you like it,25.0,1.3.54,ROSALIND,Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
16253,16254,As you like it,26.0,1.3.55,DUKE FREDERICK,"Thou art thy father's daughter, there's enough."
16254,16255,As you like it,27.0,1.3.56,ROSALIND,"So was I when your highness took his dukedom,"
16255,16256,As you like it,27.0,1.3.57,ROSALIND,So was I when your highness banish'd him:
16256,16257,As you like it,27.0,1.3.58,ROSALIND,"Treason is not inherited, my lord,"
16257,16258,As you like it,27.0,1.3.59,ROSALIND,"Or, if we did derive it from our friends,"
16258,16259,As you like it,27.0,1.3.60,ROSALIND,What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
16259,16260,As you like it,27.0,1.3.61,ROSALIND,"Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much"
16260,16261,As you like it,27.0,1.3.62,ROSALIND,To think my poverty is treacherous.
16261,16262,As you like it,28.0,1.3.63,CELIA,"Dear sovereign, hear me speak."
16262,16263,As you like it,29.0,1.3.64,DUKE FREDERICK,"Ay, Celia, we stay'd her for your sake,"
16263,16264,As you like it,29.0,1.3.65,DUKE FREDERICK,Else had she with her father ranged along.
16264,16265,As you like it,30.0,1.3.66,CELIA,"I did not then entreat to have her stay,"
16265,16266,As you like it,30.0,1.3.67,CELIA,It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
16266,16267,As you like it,30.0,1.3.68,CELIA,"I was too young that time to value her,"
16267,16268,As you like it,30.0,1.3.69,CELIA,"But now I know her: if she be a traitor,"

16277,16278,As you like it,31.0,1.3.79,DUKE FREDERICK,When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:

16322,16323,As you like it,44.0,1.3.123,CELIA,What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
16323,16324,As you like it,45.0,1.3.124,ROSALIND,"I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,"
16324,16325,As you like it,45.0,1.3.125,ROSALIND,And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
16325,16326,As you like it,45.0,1.3.126,ROSALIND,But what will you be call'd?
16326,16327,As you like it,46.0,1.3.127,CELIA,Something that hath a reference to my state

16329,16330,As you like it,47.0,1.3.130,ROSALIND,The clownish fool out of your father's court?
16330,16331,As you like it,47.0,1.3.131,ROSALIND,Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
16331,16332,As you like it,48.0,1.3.132,CELIA,"He'll go along o'er the wide world with me,"
16332,16333,As you like it,48.0,1.3.133,CELIA,"Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,"
16333,16334,As you like it,48.0,1.3.134,CELIA,"And get our jewels and our wealth together,"
16334,16335,As you like it,48.0,1.3.135,CELIA,Devise the fittest time and safest way
16335,16336,As you like it,48.0,1.3.136,CELIA,To hide us from pursuit that will be made
16336,16337,As you like it,48.0,1.3.137,CELIA,After my flight. Now go we in content

16344,16345,As you like it,1.0,2.1.3,DUKE SENIOR,Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
16345,16346,As you like it,1.0,2.1.4,DUKE SENIOR,More free from peril than the envious court?
16346,16347,As you like it,1.0,2.1.5,DUKE SENIOR,"Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,"

16380,16381,As you like it,4.0,2.1.39,First Lord,That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
16381,16382,As you like it,4.0,2.1.40,First Lord,"Almost to bursting, and the big round tears"

16387,16388,As you like it,5.0,2.1.46,DUKE SENIOR,But what said Jaques?
16388,16389,As you like it,5.0,2.1.47,DUKE SENIOR,Did he not moralize this spectacle?
16389,16390,As you like it,6.0,2.1.48,First Lord,"O, yes, into a thousand similes."
16390,16391,As you like it,6.0,2.1.49,First Lord,"First, for his weeping into the needless stream,"

16392,16393,As you like it,6.0,2.1.51,First Lord,"As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more"
16393,16394,As you like it,6.0,2.1.52,First Lord,"To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,"
16394,16395,As you like it,6.0,2.1.53,First Lord,"Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,"

16398,16399,As you like it,6.0,2.1.57,First Lord,"And never stays to greet him, 'Ay' quoth Jaques,"
16399,16400,As you like it,6.0,2.1.58,First Lord,"'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,"
16400,16401,As you like it,6.0,2.1.59,First Lord,'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
16401,16402,As you like it,6.0,2.1.60,First Lord,Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
16402,16403,As you like it,6.0,2.1.61,First Lord,Thus most invectively he pierceth through
16403,16404,As you like it,6.0,2.1.62,First Lord,"The body of the country, city, court,"
16404,16405,As you like it,6.0,2.1.63,First Lord,"Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we"
16405,16406,As you like it,6.0,2.1.64,First Lord,"Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,"
16406,16407,As you like it,6.0,2.1.65,First Lord,To fright the animals and to kill them up
16407,16408,As you like it,6.0,2.1.66,First Lord,In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
16408,16409,As you like it,7.0,2.1.67,DUKE SENIOR,And did you leave him in this contemplation?
16409,16410,As you like it,8.0,2.1.68,Second Lord,"We did, my lord, weeping and commenting"
16410,16411,As you like it,8.0,2.1.69,Second Lord,Upon the sobbing deer.
16411,16412,As you like it,9.0,2.1.70,DUKE SENIOR,Show me the place:

16413,16414,As you like it,9.0,2.1.72,DUKE SENIOR,For then he's full of matter.
16414,16415,As you like it,10.0,2.1.73,First Lord,I'll bring you to him straight.

16418,16419,As you like it,1.0,2.2.1,DUKE FREDERICK,Can it be possible that no man saw them?
16419,16420,As you like it,1.0,2.2.2,DUKE FREDERICK,It cannot be: some villains of my court

16447,16448,As you like it,2.0,2.3.6,ADAM,"And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?"
16448,16449,As you like it,2.0,2.3.7,ADAM,Why would you be so fond to overcome
16449,16450,As you like it,2.0,2.3.8,ADAM,The bonny priser of the humorous duke?

16454,16455,As you like it,2.0,2.3.13,ADAM,Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.

16465,16466,As you like it,4.0,2.3.24,ADAM,To burn the lodging where you use to lie
16466,16467,As you like it,4.0,2.3.25,ADAM,"And you within it: if he fail of that,"
16467,16468,As you like it,4.0,2.3.26,ADAM,He will have other means to cut you off.

16473,16474,As you like it,7.0,2.3.32,ORLANDO,"What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?"
16474,16475,As you like it,7.0,2.3.33,ORLANDO,Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
16475,16476,As you like it,7.0,2.3.34,ORLANDO,A thievish living on the common road?
16476,16477,As you like it,7.0,2.3.35,ORLANDO,"This I must do, or know not what to do:"
16477,16478,As you like it,7.0,2.3.36,ORLANDO,"Yet this I will not do, do how I can,"

16483,16484,As you like it,8.0,2.3.42,ADAM,When service should in my old limbs lie lame
16484,16485,As you like it,8.0,2.3.43,ADAM,And unregarded age in corners thrown:

16503,16504,As you like it,9.0,2.3.62,ORLANDO,"And having that, do choke their service up"
16504,16505,As you like it,9.0,2.3.63,ORLANDO,Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
16505,16506,As you like it,9.0,2.3.64,ORLANDO,"But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,"
16506,16507,As you like it,9.0,2.3.65,ORLANDO,That cannot so much as a blossom yield
16507,16508,As you like it,9.0,2.3.66,ORLANDO,In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
16508,16509,As you like it,9.0,2.3.67,ORLANDO,"But come thy ways, well go along together,"

16510,16511,As you like it,9.0,2.3.69,ORLANDO,We'll light upon some settled low content.
16511,16512,As you like it,10.0,2.3.70,ADAM,"Master, go on, and I will follow thee,"
16512,16513,As you like it,10.0,2.3.71,ADAM,"To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty."
16513,16514,As you like it,10.0,2.3.72,ADAM,From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
16514,16515,As you like it,10.0,2.3.73,ADAM,"Here lived I, but now live here no more."

16516,16517,As you like it,10.0,2.3.75,ADAM,But at fourscore it is too late a week:
16517,16518,As you like it,10.0,2.3.76,ADAM,Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
16518,16519,As you like it,10.0,2.3.77,ADAM,Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

16523,16524,As you like it,2.0,2.4.2,TOUCHSTONE,"I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary."
16524,16525,As you like it,3.0,2.4.3,ROSALIND,I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's

16529,16530,As you like it,4.0,2.4.8,CELIA,"I pray you, bear with me, I cannot go no further."

16531,16532,As you like it,5.0,2.4.10,TOUCHSTONE,"you, yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,"
16532,16533,As you like it,5.0,2.4.11,TOUCHSTONE,for I think you have no money in your purse.
16533,16534,As you like it,6.0,2.4.12,ROSALIND,"Well, this is the forest of Arden."
16534,16535,As you like it,7.0,2.4.13,TOUCHSTONE,"Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I, when I was"
16535,16536,As you like it,7.0,2.4.14,TOUCHSTONE,"at home, I was in a better place: but travellers"
16536,16537,As you like it,7.0,2.4.15,TOUCHSTONE,must be content.
16537,16538,As you like it,8.0,2.4.16,ROSALIND,"Ay, be so, good Touchstone."

16541,16542,As you like it,9.0,2.4.19,CORIN,That is the way to make her scorn you still.
16542,16543,As you like it,10.0,2.4.20,SILVIUS,"O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!"
16543,16544,As you like it,11.0,2.4.21,CORIN,"I partly guess, for I have loved ere now."
16544,16545,As you like it,12.0,2.4.22,SILVIUS,"No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,"
16545,16546,As you like it,12.0,2.4.23,SILVIUS,Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
16546,16547,As you like it,12.0,2.4.24,SILVIUS,As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
16547,16548,As you like it,12.0,2.4.25,SILVIUS,But if thy love were ever like to mine--
16548,16549,As you like it,12.0,2.4.26,SILVIUS,As sure I think did never man love so--
16549,16550,As you like it,12.0,2.4.27,SILVIUS,How many actions most ridiculous
16550,16551,As you like it,12.0,2.4.28,SILVIUS,Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
16551,16552,As you like it,13.0,2.4.29,CORIN,Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
16552,16553,As you like it,14.0,2.4.30,SILVIUS,"O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!"
16553,16554,As you like it,14.0,2.4.31,SILVIUS,If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
16554,16555,As you like it,14.0,2.4.32,SILVIUS,"That ever love did make thee run into,"
16555,16556,As you like it,14.0,2.4.33,SILVIUS,Thou hast not loved:
16556,16557,As you like it,14.0,2.4.34,SILVIUS,"Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,"
16557,16558,As you like it,14.0,2.4.35,SILVIUS,"Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,"
16558,16559,As you like it,14.0,2.4.36,SILVIUS,Thou hast not loved:
16559,16560,As you like it,14.0,2.4.37,SILVIUS,Or if thou hast not broke from company

16561,16562,As you like it,14.0,2.4.39,SILVIUS,Thou hast not loved.
16562,16563,As you like it,14.0,2.4.40,SILVIUS,"O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!"
16563,16564,As you like it,14.0,,SILVIUS,Exit
16564,16565,As you like it,15.0,2.4.41,ROSALIND,"Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,"
16565,16566,As you like it,15.0,2.4.42,ROSALIND,I have by hard adventure found mine own.
16566,16567,As you like it,16.0,2.4.43,TOUCHSTONE,"And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke"
16567,16568,As you like it,16.0,2.4.44,TOUCHSTONE,my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
16568,16569,As you like it,16.0,2.4.45,TOUCHSTONE,"coming a-night to Jane Smile, and I remember the"
16569,16570,As you like it,16.0,2.4.46,TOUCHSTONE,kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
16570,16571,As you like it,16.0,2.4.47,TOUCHSTONE,"pretty chopt hands had milked, and I remember the"
16571,16572,As you like it,16.0,2.4.48,TOUCHSTONE,"wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took"
16572,16573,As you like it,16.0,2.4.49,TOUCHSTONE,"two cods and, giving her them again, said with"
16573,16574,As you like it,16.0,2.4.50,TOUCHSTONE,weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
16574,16575,As you like it,16.0,2.4.51,TOUCHSTONE,"true lovers run into strange capers, but as all is"
16575,16576,As you like it,16.0,2.4.52,TOUCHSTONE,"mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly."
16576,16577,As you like it,17.0,2.4.53,ROSALIND,Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
16577,16578,As you like it,18.0,2.4.54,TOUCHSTONE,"Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I"
16578,16579,As you like it,18.0,2.4.55,TOUCHSTONE,break my shins against it.
16579,16580,As you like it,19.0,2.4.56,ROSALIND,"Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion"
16580,16581,As you like it,19.0,2.4.57,ROSALIND,Is much upon my fashion.
16581,16582,As you like it,20.0,2.4.58,TOUCHSTONE,"And mine, but it grows something stale with me."
16582,16583,As you like it,21.0,2.4.59,CELIA,"I pray you, one of you question yond man"
16583,16584,As you like it,21.0,2.4.60,CELIA,If he for gold will give us any food:
16584,16585,As you like it,21.0,2.4.61,CELIA,I faint almost to death.
16585,16586,As you like it,22.0,2.4.62,TOUCHSTONE,"Holla, you clown!"
16586,16587,As you like it,23.0,2.4.63,ROSALIND,"Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman."
16587,16588,As you like it,24.0,2.4.64,CORIN,Who calls?
16588,16589,As you like it,25.0,2.4.65,TOUCHSTONE,"Your betters, sir."
16589,16590,As you like it,26.0,2.4.66,CORIN,Else are they very wretched.
16590,16591,As you like it,27.0,2.4.67,ROSALIND,"Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend."
16591,16592,As you like it,28.0,2.4.68,CORIN,"And to you, gentle sir, and to you all."

16594,16595,As you like it,29.0,2.4.71,ROSALIND,Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
16595,16596,As you like it,29.0,2.4.72,ROSALIND,Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
16596,16597,As you like it,29.0,2.4.73,ROSALIND,And faints for succor.
16597,16598,As you like it,30.0,2.4.74,CORIN,"Fair sir, I pity her"
16598,16599,As you like it,30.0,2.4.75,CORIN,"And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,"
16599,16600,As you like it,30.0,2.4.76,CORIN,"My fortunes were more able to relieve her,"
16600,16601,As you like it,30.0,2.4.77,CORIN,But I am shepherd to another man
16601,16602,As you like it,30.0,2.4.78,CORIN,And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
16602,16603,As you like it,30.0,2.4.79,CORIN,My master is of churlish disposition
16603,16604,As you like it,30.0,2.4.80,CORIN,And little recks to find the way to heaven
16604,16605,As you like it,30.0,2.4.81,CORIN,By doing deeds of hospitality:
16605,16606,As you like it,30.0,2.4.82,CORIN,"Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed"
16606,16607,As you like it,30.0,2.4.83,CORIN,"Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,"

16609,16610,As you like it,30.0,2.4.86,CORIN,And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
16610,16611,As you like it,31.0,2.4.87,ROSALIND,What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
16611,16612,As you like it,32.0,2.4.88,CORIN,"That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,"
16612,16613,As you like it,32.0,2.4.89,CORIN,That little cares for buying any thing.

16615,16616,As you like it,33.0,2.4.92,ROSALIND,And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
16616,16617,As you like it,34.0,2.4.93,CELIA,And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
16617,16618,As you like it,34.0,2.4.94,CELIA,And willingly could waste my time in it.
16618,16619,As you like it,35.0,2.4.95,CORIN,Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
16619,16620,As you like it,35.0,2.4.96,CORIN,Go with me: if you like upon report
16620,16621,As you like it,35.0,2.4.97,CORIN,"The soil, the profit and this kind of life,"
16621,16622,As you like it,35.0,2.4.98,CORIN,I will your very faithful feeder be
16622,16623,As you like it,35.0,2.4.99,CORIN,And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

16981,16982,As you like it,10.0,3.2.37,CORIN,For not being at court? Your reason.

17161,17162,As you like it,63.0,3.2.214,ROSALIND,How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
17162,17163,As you like it,63.0,3.2.215,ROSALIND,him again? Answer me in one word.
17163,17164,As you like it,64.0,3.2.216,CELIA,You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
17164,17165,As you like it,64.0,3.2.217,CELIA,word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
17165,17166,As you like it,64.0,3.2.218,CELIA,say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
17166,17167,As you like it,64.0,3.2.219,CELIA,answer in a catechism.
17167,17168,As you like it,65.0,3.2.220,ROSALIND,But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
17168,17169,As you like it,65.0,3.2.221,ROSALIND,man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
17169,17170,As you like it,65.0,3.2.222,ROSALIND,day he wrestled?
17170,17171,As you like it,66.0,3.2.223,CELIA,It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
17171,17172,As you like it,66.0,3.2.224,CELIA,"propositions of a lover, but take a taste of my"
17172,17173,As you like it,66.0,3.2.225,CELIA,"finding him, and relish it with good observance."
17173,17174,As you like it,66.0,3.2.226,CELIA,"I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn."
17174,17175,As you like it,67.0,3.2.227,ROSALIND,"It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops"

17177,17178,As you like it,69.0,3.2.230,ROSALIND,Proceed.
17178,17179,As you like it,70.0,3.2.231,CELIA,"There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight."

17184,17185,As you like it,74.0,3.2.237,CELIA,I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest

17203,17204,As you like it,86.0,3.2.255,JAQUES,I do not like her name.
17204,17205,As you like it,87.0,3.2.256,ORLANDO,There was no thought of pleasing you when she was

17206,17207,As you like it,88.0,3.2.258,JAQUES,What stature is she of?
17207,17208,As you like it,89.0,3.2.259,ORLANDO,Just as high as my heart.
17208,17209,As you like it,90.0,3.2.260,JAQUES,You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been

17213,17214,As you like it,92.0,3.2.265,JAQUES,You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
17214,17215,As you like it,92.0,3.2.266,JAQUES,Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
17215,17216,As you like it,92.0,3.2.267,JAQUES,we two will rail against our mistress the world and
17216,17217,As you like it,92.0,3.2.268,JAQUES,all our misery.

17234,17235,As you like it,102.0,3.2.285,ROSALIND,lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
17235,17236,As you like it,102.0,3.2.286,ROSALIND,"Do you hear, forester?"
17236,17237,As you like it,103.0,3.2.287,ORLANDO,Very well: what would you?
17237,17238,As you like it,104.0,3.2.288,ROSALIND,"I pray you, what is't o'clock?"
17238,17239,As you like it,105.0,3.2.289,ORLANDO,You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock

17243,17244,As you like it,107.0,3.2.294,ORLANDO,And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
17244,17245,As you like it,107.0,3.2.295,ORLANDO,been as proper?
17245,17246,As you like it,108.0,3.2.296,ROSALIND,"By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with"
17246,17247,As you like it,108.0,3.2.297,ROSALIND,divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
17247,17248,As you like it,108.0,3.2.298,ROSALIND,"withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops"
17248,17249,As you like it,108.0,3.2.299,ROSALIND,withal and who he stands still withal.
17249,17250,As you like it,109.0,3.2.300,ORLANDO,"I prithee, who doth he trot withal?"
17250,17251,As you like it,110.0,3.2.301,ROSALIND,"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the"

17253,17254,As you like it,110.0,3.2.304,ROSALIND,Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
17254,17255,As you like it,110.0,3.2.305,ROSALIND,seven year.
17255,17256,As you like it,111.0,3.2.306,ORLANDO,Who ambles Time withal?
17256,17257,As you like it,112.0,3.2.307,ROSALIND,With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
17257,17258,As you like it,112.0,3.2.308,ROSALIND,"hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because"
17258,17259,As you like it,112.0,3.2.309,ROSALIND,"he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because"
17259,17260,As you like it,112.0,3.2.310,ROSALIND,"he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean"
17260,17261,As you like it,112.0,3.2.311,ROSALIND,"and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden"
17261,17262,As you like it,112.0,3.2.312,ROSALIND,"of heavy tedious penury, these Time ambles withal."
17262,17263,As you like it,113.0,3.2.313,ORLANDO,Who doth he gallop withal?
17263,17264,As you like it,114.0,3.2.314,ROSALIND,"With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as"
17264,17265,As you like it,114.0,3.2.315,ROSALIND,"softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there."
17265,17266,As you like it,115.0,3.2.316,ORLANDO,Who stays it still withal?
17266,17267,As you like it,116.0,3.2.317,ROSALIND,"With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between"
17267,17268,As you like it,116.0,3.2.318,ROSALIND,term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
17268,17269,As you like it,117.0,3.2.319,ORLANDO,"Where dwell you, pretty youth?"
17269,17270,As you like it,118.0,3.2.320,ROSALIND,"With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the"
17270,17271,As you like it,118.0,3.2.321,ROSALIND,"skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat."
17271,17272,As you like it,119.0,3.2.322,ORLANDO,Are you native of this place?
17272,17273,As you like it,120.0,3.2.323,ROSALIND,As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
17273,17274,As you like it,121.0,3.2.324,ORLANDO,Your accent is something finer than you could
17274,17275,As you like it,121.0,3.2.325,ORLANDO,purchase in so removed a dwelling.
17275,17276,As you like it,122.0,3.2.326,ROSALIND,I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
17276,17277,As you like it,122.0,3.2.327,ROSALIND,"religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was"
17277,17278,As you like it,122.0,3.2.328,ROSALIND,"in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship"
17278,17279,As you like it,122.0,3.2.329,ROSALIND,"too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard"
17279,17280,As you like it,122.0,3.2.330,ROSALIND,"him read many lectures against it, and I thank God"
17280,17281,As you like it,122.0,3.2.331,ROSALIND,"I am not a woman, to be touched with so many"
17281,17282,As you like it,122.0,3.2.332,ROSALIND,giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their

17283,17284,As you like it,123.0,3.2.334,ORLANDO,Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
17284,17285,As you like it,123.0,3.2.335,ORLANDO,laid to the charge of women?
17285,17286,As you like it,124.0,3.2.336,ROSALIND,"There were none principal, they were all like one"
17286,17287,As you like it,124.0,3.2.337,ROSALIND,"another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming"
17287,17288,As you like it,124.0,3.2.338,ROSALIND,monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
17288,17289,As you like it,125.0,3.2.339,ORLANDO,"I prithee, recount some of them."
17289,17290,As you like it,126.0,3.2.340,ROSALIND,"No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that"
17290,17291,As you like it,126.0,3.2.341,ROSALIND,"are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that"
17291,17292,As you like it,126.0,3.2.342,ROSALIND,abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
17292,17293,As you like it,126.0,3.2.343,ROSALIND,"their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies"
17293,17294,As you like it,126.0,3.2.344,ROSALIND,"on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of"
17294,17295,As you like it,126.0,3.2.345,ROSALIND,Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
17295,17296,As you like it,126.0,3.2.346,ROSALIND,"give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the"
17296,17297,As you like it,126.0,3.2.347,ROSALIND,quotidian of love upon him.
17297,17298,As you like it,127.0,3.2.348,ORLANDO,I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
17298,17299,As you like it,127.0,3.2.349,ORLANDO,your remedy.
17299,17300,As you like it,128.0,3.2.350,ROSALIND,There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
17300,17301,As you like it,128.0,3.2.351,ROSALIND,"taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage"
17301,17302,As you like it,128.0,3.2.352,ROSALIND,of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
17302,17303,As you like it,129.0,3.2.353,ORLANDO,What were his marks?
17303,17304,As you like it,130.0,3.2.354,ROSALIND,"A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and"
17304,17305,As you like it,130.0,3.2.355,ROSALIND,"sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable"
17305,17306,As you like it,130.0,3.2.356,ROSALIND,"spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,"
17306,17307,As you like it,130.0,3.2.357,ROSALIND,"which you have not, but I pardon you for that, for"
17307,17308,As you like it,130.0,3.2.358,ROSALIND,simply your having in beard is a younger brother's

17309,17310,As you like it,130.0,3.2.360,ROSALIND,"bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe"
17310,17311,As you like it,130.0,3.2.361,ROSALIND,untied and every thing about you demonstrating a

17312,17313,As you like it,130.0,3.2.363,ROSALIND,are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
17313,17314,As you like it,130.0,3.2.364,ROSALIND,loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
17314,17315,As you like it,131.0,3.2.365,ORLANDO,"Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love."
17315,17316,As you like it,132.0,3.2.366,ROSALIND,Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you

17317,17318,As you like it,132.0,3.2.368,ROSALIND,do than to confess she does: that is one of the
17318,17319,As you like it,132.0,3.2.369,ROSALIND,points in the which women still give the lie to
17319,17320,As you like it,132.0,3.2.370,ROSALIND,"their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he"
17320,17321,As you like it,132.0,3.2.371,ROSALIND,"that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind"
17321,17322,As you like it,132.0,3.2.372,ROSALIND,is so admired?

17324,17325,As you like it,134.0,3.2.375,ROSALIND,But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
17325,17326,As you like it,135.0,3.2.376,ORLANDO,Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
17326,17327,As you like it,136.0,3.2.377,ROSALIND,"Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves"
17327,17328,As you like it,136.0,3.2.378,ROSALIND,as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
17328,17329,As you like it,136.0,3.2.379,ROSALIND,the reason why they are not so punished and cured
17329,17330,As you like it,136.0,3.2.380,ROSALIND,"is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers"
17330,17331,As you like it,136.0,3.2.381,ROSALIND,are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
17331,17332,As you like it,137.0,3.2.382,ORLANDO,Did you ever cure any so?
17332,17333,As you like it,138.0,3.2.383,ROSALIND,"Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me"
17333,17334,As you like it,138.0,3.2.384,ROSALIND,"his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to"
17334,17335,As you like it,138.0,3.2.385,ROSALIND,"woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish"
17335,17336,As you like it,138.0,3.2.386,ROSALIND,"youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing"
17336,17337,As you like it,138.0,3.2.387,ROSALIND,"and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,"
17337,17338,As you like it,138.0,3.2.388,ROSALIND,"inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every"
17338,17339,As you like it,138.0,3.2.389,ROSALIND,passion something and for no passion truly any
17339,17340,As you like it,138.0,3.2.390,ROSALIND,"thing, as boys and women are for the most part"
17340,17341,As you like it,138.0,3.2.391,ROSALIND,"cattle of this colour, would now like him, now loathe"
17341,17342,As you like it,138.0,3.2.392,ROSALIND,"him, then entertain him, then forswear him, now weep"
17342,17343,As you like it,138.0,3.2.393,ROSALIND,"for him, then spit at him, that I drave my suitor"
17343,17344,As you like it,138.0,3.2.394,ROSALIND,from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
17344,17345,As you like it,138.0,3.2.395,ROSALIND,"madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of"
17345,17346,As you like it,138.0,3.2.396,ROSALIND,"the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic."
17346,17347,As you like it,138.0,3.2.397,ROSALIND,"And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon"
17347,17348,As you like it,138.0,3.2.398,ROSALIND,me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
17348,17349,As you like it,138.0,3.2.399,ROSALIND,"heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't."
17349,17350,As you like it,139.0,3.2.400,ORLANDO,"I would not be cured, youth."
17350,17351,As you like it,140.0,3.2.401,ROSALIND,"I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind"
17351,17352,As you like it,140.0,3.2.402,ROSALIND,and come every day to my cote and woo me.
17352,17353,As you like it,141.0,3.2.403,ORLANDO,"Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me"
17353,17354,As you like it,141.0,3.2.404,ORLANDO,where it is.
17354,17355,As you like it,142.0,3.2.405,ROSALIND,Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
17355,17356,As you like it,142.0,3.2.406,ROSALIND,you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
17356,17357,As you like it,142.0,3.2.407,ROSALIND,Will you go?
17357,17358,As you like it,143.0,3.2.408,ORLANDO,"With all my heart, good youth."
17358,17359,As you like it,144.0,3.2.409,ROSALIND,"Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?"

17364,17365,As you like it,1.0,3.3.3,TOUCHSTONE,doth my simple feature content you?
17365,17366,As you like it,2.0,3.3.4,AUDREY,Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
17366,17367,As you like it,3.0,3.3.5,TOUCHSTONE,"I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most"
17367,17368,As you like it,3.0,3.3.6,TOUCHSTONE,"capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths."

17371,17372,As you like it,5.0,3.3.10,TOUCHSTONE,man's good wit seconded with the forward child
17372,17373,As you like it,5.0,3.3.11,TOUCHSTONE,"Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a"
17373,17374,As you like it,5.0,3.3.12,TOUCHSTONE,"great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would"
17374,17375,As you like it,5.0,3.3.13,TOUCHSTONE,the gods had made thee poetical.
17375,17376,As you like it,6.0,3.3.14,AUDREY,I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
17376,17377,As you like it,6.0,3.3.15,AUDREY,deed and word? is it a true thing?
17377,17378,As you like it,7.0,3.3.16,TOUCHSTONE,"No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most"
17378,17379,As you like it,7.0,3.3.17,TOUCHSTONE,"feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what"
17379,17380,As you like it,7.0,3.3.18,TOUCHSTONE,they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
17380,17381,As you like it,8.0,3.3.19,AUDREY,Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
17381,17382,As you like it,9.0,3.3.20,TOUCHSTONE,"I do, truly, for thou swearest to me thou art"
17382,17383,As you like it,9.0,3.3.21,TOUCHSTONE,"honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some"
17383,17384,As you like it,9.0,3.3.22,TOUCHSTONE,hope thou didst feign.
17384,17385,As you like it,10.0,3.3.23,AUDREY,Would you not have me honest?
17385,17386,As you like it,11.0,3.3.24,TOUCHSTONE,"No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured, for"
17386,17387,As you like it,11.0,3.3.25,TOUCHSTONE,honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
17387,17388,As you like it,12.0,3.3.26,JAQUES,[Aside]  A material fool!
17388,17389,As you like it,13.0,3.3.27,AUDREY,"Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods"
17389,17390,As you like it,13.0,3.3.28,AUDREY,make me honest.
17390,17391,As you like it,14.0,3.3.29,TOUCHSTONE,"Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut"
17391,17392,As you like it,14.0,3.3.30,TOUCHSTONE,were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
17392,17393,As you like it,15.0,3.3.31,AUDREY,"I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul."
17393,17394,As you like it,16.0,3.3.32,TOUCHSTONE,"Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!"
17394,17395,As you like it,16.0,3.3.33,TOUCHSTONE,sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
17395,17396,As you like it,16.0,3.3.34,TOUCHSTONE,"be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been"
17396,17397,As you like it,16.0,3.3.35,TOUCHSTONE,"with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next"

17399,17400,As you like it,17.0,3.3.38,JAQUES,[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
17400,17401,As you like it,18.0,3.3.39,AUDREY,"Well, the gods give us joy!"
17401,17402,As you like it,19.0,3.3.40,TOUCHSTONE,"Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,"
17402,17403,As you like it,19.0,3.3.41,TOUCHSTONE,"stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple"
17403,17404,As you like it,19.0,3.3.42,TOUCHSTONE,"but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what"
17404,17405,As you like it,19.0,3.3.43,TOUCHSTONE,"though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are"
17405,17406,As you like it,19.0,3.3.44,TOUCHSTONE,"necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of"
17406,17407,As you like it,19.0,3.3.45,TOUCHSTONE,"his goods:' right, many a man has good horns, and"
17407,17408,As you like it,19.0,3.3.46,TOUCHSTONE,"knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of"
17408,17409,As you like it,19.0,3.3.47,TOUCHSTONE,"his wife, 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?"
17409,17410,As you like it,19.0,3.3.48,TOUCHSTONE,"Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer"
17410,17411,As you like it,19.0,3.3.49,TOUCHSTONE,hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
17411,17412,As you like it,19.0,3.3.50,TOUCHSTONE,therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
17412,17413,As you like it,19.0,3.3.51,TOUCHSTONE,"worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a"
17413,17414,As you like it,19.0,3.3.52,TOUCHSTONE,married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
17414,17415,As you like it,19.0,3.3.53,TOUCHSTONE,"bachelor, and by how much defence is better than no"
17415,17416,As you like it,19.0,3.3.54,TOUCHSTONE,"skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to"
17416,17417,As you like it,19.0,3.3.55,TOUCHSTONE,want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
17417,17418,As you like it,19.0,,TOUCHSTONE,Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

17421,17422,As you like it,20.0,3.3.59,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,Is there none here to give the woman?
17422,17423,As you like it,21.0,3.3.60,TOUCHSTONE,I will not take her on gift of any man.
17423,17424,As you like it,22.0,3.3.61,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,"Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful."

17430,17431,As you like it,25.0,3.3.68,JAQUES,"Will you be married, motley?"
17431,17432,As you like it,26.0,3.3.69,TOUCHSTONE,"As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and"
17432,17433,As you like it,26.0,3.3.70,TOUCHSTONE,"the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires, and"
17433,17434,As you like it,26.0,3.3.71,TOUCHSTONE,"as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling."

17435,17436,As you like it,27.0,3.3.73,JAQUES,married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to

17437,17438,As you like it,27.0,3.3.75,JAQUES,what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
17438,17439,As you like it,27.0,3.3.76,JAQUES,"together as they join wainscot, then one of you will"
17439,17440,As you like it,27.0,3.3.77,JAQUES,"prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp."
17440,17441,As you like it,28.0,3.3.78,TOUCHSTONE,[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
17441,17442,As you like it,28.0,3.3.79,TOUCHSTONE,married of him than of another: for he is not like
17442,17443,As you like it,28.0,3.3.80,TOUCHSTONE,"to marry me well, and not being well married, it"
17443,17444,As you like it,28.0,3.3.81,TOUCHSTONE,will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
17444,17445,As you like it,29.0,3.3.82,JAQUES,"Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee."
17445,17446,As you like it,30.0,3.3.83,TOUCHSTONE,"'Come, sweet Audrey:"

17462,17463,As you like it,2.0,3.4.3,CELIA,that tears do not become a man.
17463,17464,As you like it,3.0,3.4.4,ROSALIND,But have I not cause to weep?
17464,17465,As you like it,4.0,3.4.5,CELIA,"As good cause as one would desire, therefore weep."
17465,17466,As you like it,5.0,3.4.6,ROSALIND,His very hair is of the dissembling colour.

17468,17469,As you like it,7.0,3.4.9,ROSALIND,"I' faith, his hair is of a good colour."
17469,17470,As you like it,8.0,3.4.10,CELIA,An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
17470,17471,As you like it,9.0,3.4.11,ROSALIND,And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
17471,17472,As you like it,9.0,3.4.12,ROSALIND,of holy bread.
17472,17473,As you like it,10.0,3.4.13,CELIA,He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
17473,17474,As you like it,10.0,3.4.14,CELIA,"of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously,"
17474,17475,As you like it,10.0,3.4.15,CELIA,the very ice of chastity is in them.
17475,17476,As you like it,11.0,3.4.16,ROSALIND,"But why did he swear he would come this morning, and"
17476,17477,As you like it,11.0,3.4.17,ROSALIND,comes not?
17477,17478,As you like it,12.0,3.4.18,CELIA,"Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him."
17478,17479,As you like it,13.0,3.4.19,ROSALIND,Do you think so?

17481,17482,As you like it,14.0,3.4.22,CELIA,think him as concave as a covered goblet or a

17483,17484,As you like it,15.0,3.4.24,ROSALIND,Not true in love?
17484,17485,As you like it,16.0,3.4.25,CELIA,"Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in."
17485,17486,As you like it,17.0,3.4.26,ROSALIND,You have heard him swear downright he was.
17486,17487,As you like it,18.0,3.4.27,CELIA,"'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is"

17488,17489,As you like it,18.0,3.4.29,CELIA,both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
17489,17490,As you like it,18.0,3.4.30,CELIA,here in the forest on the duke your father.
17490,17491,As you like it,19.0,3.4.31,ROSALIND,I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
17491,17492,As you like it,19.0,3.4.32,ROSALIND,"him: he asked me of what parentage I was, I told"
17492,17493,As you like it,19.0,3.4.33,ROSALIND,"him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go."
17493,17494,As you like it,19.0,3.4.34,ROSALIND,"But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a"
17494,17495,As you like it,19.0,3.4.35,ROSALIND,man as Orlando?
17495,17496,As you like it,20.0,3.4.36,CELIA,"O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,"
17496,17497,As you like it,20.0,3.4.37,CELIA,"speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks"

17498,17499,As you like it,20.0,3.4.39,CELIA,"his lover, as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse"
17499,17500,As you like it,20.0,3.4.40,CELIA,"but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble"
17500,17501,As you like it,20.0,3.4.41,CELIA,goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly

17511,17512,As you like it,23.0,3.4.51,CORIN,"And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,"
17512,17513,As you like it,23.0,3.4.52,CORIN,"Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,"
17513,17514,As you like it,23.0,3.4.53,CORIN,If you will mark it.

17525,17526,As you like it,1.0,3.5.5,SILVIUS,Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
17526,17527,As you like it,1.0,3.5.6,SILVIUS,But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
17527,17528,As you like it,1.0,3.5.7,SILVIUS,Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

17564,17565,As you like it,5.0,3.5.43,ROSALIND,"Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?"
17565,17566,As you like it,5.0,3.5.44,ROSALIND,I see no more in you than in the ordinary

17569,17570,As you like it,5.0,3.5.48,ROSALIND,"'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,"
17570,17571,As you like it,5.0,3.5.49,ROSALIND,"Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,"
17571,17572,As you like it,5.0,3.5.50,ROSALIND,That can entame my spirits to your worship.
17572,17573,As you like it,5.0,3.5.51,ROSALIND,"You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,"
17573,17574,As you like it,5.0,3.5.52,ROSALIND,Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
17574,17575,As you like it,5.0,3.5.53,ROSALIND,You are a thousand times a properer man
17575,17576,As you like it,5.0,3.5.54,ROSALIND,Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you

17578,17579,As you like it,5.0,3.5.57,ROSALIND,And out of you she sees herself more proper
17579,17580,As you like it,5.0,3.5.58,ROSALIND,Than any of her lineaments can show her.
17580,17581,As you like it,5.0,3.5.59,ROSALIND,"But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,"
17581,17582,As you like it,5.0,3.5.60,ROSALIND,"And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:"
17582,17583,As you like it,5.0,3.5.61,ROSALIND,"For I must tell you friendly in your ear,"
17583,17584,As you like it,5.0,3.5.62,ROSALIND,Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:

17585,17586,As you like it,5.0,3.5.64,ROSALIND,"Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer."
17586,17587,As you like it,5.0,3.5.65,ROSALIND,"So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well."
17587,17588,As you like it,6.0,3.5.66,PHEBE,"Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:"
17588,17589,As you like it,6.0,3.5.67,PHEBE,I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
17589,17590,As you like it,7.0,3.5.68,ROSALIND,He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
17590,17591,As you like it,7.0,3.5.69,ROSALIND,"fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as"
17591,17592,As you like it,7.0,3.5.70,ROSALIND,"she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her"
17592,17593,As you like it,7.0,3.5.71,ROSALIND,with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
17593,17594,As you like it,8.0,3.5.72,PHEBE,For no ill will I bear you.
17594,17595,As you like it,9.0,3.5.73,ROSALIND,"I pray you, do not fall in love with me,"
17595,17596,As you like it,9.0,3.5.74,ROSALIND,For I am falser than vows made in wine:
17596,17597,As you like it,9.0,3.5.75,ROSALIND,"Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,"

17615,17616,As you like it,17.0,3.5.93,SILVIUS,I would have you.
17616,17617,As you like it,18.0,3.5.94,PHEBE,"Why, that were covetousness."

17623,17624,As you like it,18.0,3.5.101,PHEBE,Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

17632,17633,As you like it,21.0,3.5.110,SILVIUS,And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
17633,17634,As you like it,21.0,3.5.111,SILVIUS,That the old carlot once was master of.
17634,17635,As you like it,22.0,3.5.112,PHEBE,"Think not I love him, though I ask for him:"

17637,17638,As you like it,22.0,3.5.115,PHEBE,When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
17638,17639,As you like it,22.0,3.5.116,PHEBE,It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
17639,17640,As you like it,22.0,3.5.117,PHEBE,"But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:"
17640,17641,As you like it,22.0,3.5.118,PHEBE,He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
17641,17642,As you like it,22.0,3.5.119,PHEBE,"Is his complexion, and faster than his tongue"
17642,17643,As you like it,22.0,3.5.120,PHEBE,Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
17643,17644,As you like it,22.0,3.5.121,PHEBE,"He is not very tall, yet for his years he's tall:"
17644,17645,As you like it,22.0,3.5.122,PHEBE,"His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well:"
17645,17646,As you like it,22.0,3.5.123,PHEBE,"There was a pretty redness in his lip,"
17646,17647,As you like it,22.0,3.5.124,PHEBE,A little riper and more lusty red
17647,17648,As you like it,22.0,3.5.125,PHEBE,"Than that mix'd in his cheek, 'twas just the difference"
17648,17649,As you like it,22.0,3.5.126,PHEBE,Between the constant red and mingled damask.
17649,17650,As you like it,22.0,3.5.127,PHEBE,"There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him"
17650,17651,As you like it,22.0,3.5.128,PHEBE,"In parcels as I did, would have gone near"
17651,17652,As you like it,22.0,3.5.129,PHEBE,"To fall in love with him, but, for my part,"
17652,17653,As you like it,22.0,3.5.130,PHEBE,"I love him not nor hate him not, and yet"
17653,17654,As you like it,22.0,3.5.131,PHEBE,I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
17654,17655,As you like it,22.0,3.5.132,PHEBE,For what had he to do to chide at me?
17655,17656,As you like it,22.0,3.5.133,PHEBE,He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
17656,17657,As you like it,22.0,3.5.134,PHEBE,"And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:"
17657,17658,As you like it,22.0,3.5.135,PHEBE,I marvel why I answer'd not again:
17658,17659,As you like it,22.0,3.5.136,PHEBE,"But that's all one, omittance is no quittance."
17659,17660,As you like it,22.0,3.5.137,PHEBE,"I'll write to him a very taunting letter,"
17660,17661,As you like it,22.0,3.5.138,PHEBE,"And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?"
17661,17662,As you like it,23.0,3.5.139,SILVIUS,"Phebe, with all my heart."
17662,17663,As you like it,24.0,3.5.140,PHEBE,"I'll write it straight,"
17663,17664,As you like it,24.0,3.5.141,PHEBE,The matter's in my head and in my heart:
17664,17665,As you like it,24.0,3.5.142,PHEBE,I will be bitter with him and passing short.
17665,17666,As you like it,24.0,3.5.143,PHEBE,"Go with me, Silvius."

17690,17691,As you like it,8.0,4.1.21,ROSALIND,be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see

17692,17693,As you like it,8.0,4.1.23,ROSALIND,"nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands."

17694,17695,As you like it,10.0,4.1.25,ROSALIND,And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have

17720,17721,As you like it,19.0,4.1.49,ROSALIND,"Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he"
17721,17722,As you like it,19.0,4.1.50,ROSALIND,"carries his house on his head, a better jointure,"
17722,17723,As you like it,19.0,4.1.51,ROSALIND,"I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings"

17724,17725,As you like it,20.0,4.1.53,ORLANDO,What's that?

17734,17735,As you like it,25.0,4.1.63,ROSALIND,"say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?"
17735,17736,As you like it,26.0,4.1.64,ORLANDO,I would kiss before I spoke.
17736,17737,As you like it,27.0,4.1.65,ROSALIND,"Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were"
17737,17738,As you like it,27.0,4.1.66,ROSALIND,"gravelled for lack of matter, you might take"
17738,17739,As you like it,27.0,4.1.67,ROSALIND,"occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are"
17739,17740,As you like it,27.0,4.1.68,ROSALIND,"out, they will spit, and for lovers lacking--God"
17740,17741,As you like it,27.0,4.1.69,ROSALIND,"warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss."
17741,17742,As you like it,28.0,4.1.70,ORLANDO,How if the kiss be denied?
17742,17743,As you like it,29.0,4.1.71,ROSALIND,"Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter."
17743,17744,As you like it,30.0,4.1.72,ORLANDO,"Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?"

17745,17746,As you like it,31.0,4.1.74,ROSALIND,I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.

17747,17748,As you like it,33.0,4.1.76,ROSALIND,"Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit."
17748,17749,As you like it,33.0,4.1.77,ROSALIND,Am not I your Rosalind?
17749,17750,As you like it,34.0,4.1.78,ORLANDO,"I take some joy to say you are, because I would be"
17750,17751,As you like it,34.0,4.1.79,ORLANDO,talking of her.
17751,17752,As you like it,35.0,4.1.80,ROSALIND,Well in her person I say I will not have you.
17752,17753,As you like it,36.0,4.1.81,ORLANDO,Then in mine own person I die.
17753,17754,As you like it,37.0,4.1.82,ROSALIND,"No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is"
17754,17755,As you like it,37.0,4.1.83,ROSALIND,"almost six thousand years old, and in all this time"
17755,17756,As you like it,37.0,4.1.84,ROSALIND,"there was not any man died in his own person,"
17756,17757,As you like it,37.0,4.1.85,ROSALIND,"videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains"

17758,17759,As you like it,37.0,4.1.87,ROSALIND,"could to die before, and he is one of the patterns"
17759,17760,As you like it,37.0,4.1.88,ROSALIND,"of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair"

17762,17763,As you like it,37.0,4.1.91,ROSALIND,but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
17763,17764,As you like it,37.0,4.1.92,ROSALIND,taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
17764,17765,As you like it,37.0,4.1.93,ROSALIND,coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
17765,17766,As you like it,37.0,4.1.94,ROSALIND,But these are all lies: men have died from time to
17766,17767,As you like it,37.0,4.1.95,ROSALIND,"time and worms have eaten them, but not for love."
17767,17768,As you like it,38.0,4.1.96,ORLANDO,"I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,"
17768,17769,As you like it,38.0,4.1.97,ORLANDO,"for, I protest, her frown might kill me."
17769,17770,As you like it,39.0,4.1.98,ROSALIND,"By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now"
17770,17771,As you like it,39.0,4.1.99,ROSALIND,I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
17771,17772,As you like it,39.0,4.1.100,ROSALIND,"disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant"
17772,17773,As you like it,39.0,4.1.101,ROSALIND,it.
17773,17774,As you like it,40.0,4.1.102,ORLANDO,"Then love me, Rosalind."
17774,17775,As you like it,41.0,4.1.103,ROSALIND,"Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all."
17775,17776,As you like it,42.0,4.1.104,ORLANDO,And wilt thou have me?
17776,17777,As you like it,43.0,4.1.105,ROSALIND,"Ay, and twenty such."
17777,17778,As you like it,44.0,4.1.106,ORLANDO,What sayest thou?
17778,17779,As you like it,45.0,4.1.107,ROSALIND,Are you not good?
17779,17780,As you like it,46.0,4.1.108,ORLANDO,I hope so.
17780,17781,As you like it,47.0,4.1.109,ROSALIND,"Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?"
17781,17782,As you like it,47.0,4.1.110,ROSALIND,"Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us."
17782,17783,As you like it,47.0,4.1.111,ROSALIND,"Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?"
17783,17784,As you like it,48.0,4.1.112,ORLANDO,"Pray thee, marry us."
17784,17785,As you like it,49.0,4.1.113,CELIA,I cannot say the words.
17785,17786,As you like it,50.0,4.1.114,ROSALIND,"You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'"
17786,17787,As you like it,51.0,4.1.115,CELIA,"Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?"
17787,17788,As you like it,52.0,4.1.116,ORLANDO,I will.
17788,17789,As you like it,53.0,4.1.117,ROSALIND,"Ay, but when?"
17789,17790,As you like it,54.0,4.1.118,ORLANDO,"Why now, as fast as she can marry us."
17790,17791,As you like it,55.0,4.1.119,ROSALIND,"Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'"
17791,17792,As you like it,56.0,4.1.120,ORLANDO,"I take thee, Rosalind, for wife."
17792,17793,As you like it,57.0,4.1.121,ROSALIND,"I might ask you for your commission, but I do take"
17793,17794,As you like it,57.0,4.1.122,ROSALIND,"thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes"
17794,17795,As you like it,57.0,4.1.123,ROSALIND,"before the priest, and certainly a woman's thought"
17795,17796,As you like it,57.0,4.1.124,ROSALIND,runs before her actions.
17796,17797,As you like it,58.0,4.1.125,ORLANDO,"So do all thoughts, they are winged."
17797,17798,As you like it,59.0,4.1.126,ROSALIND,Now tell me how long you would have her after you
17798,17799,As you like it,59.0,4.1.127,ROSALIND,have possessed her.
17799,17800,As you like it,60.0,4.1.128,ORLANDO,For ever and a day.
17800,17801,As you like it,61.0,4.1.129,ROSALIND,"Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando,"
17801,17802,As you like it,61.0,4.1.130,ROSALIND,"men are April when they woo, December when they wed:"
17802,17803,As you like it,61.0,4.1.131,ROSALIND,"maids are May when they are maids, but the sky"
17803,17804,As you like it,61.0,4.1.132,ROSALIND,changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
17804,17805,As you like it,61.0,4.1.133,ROSALIND,"of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,"
17805,17806,As you like it,61.0,4.1.134,ROSALIND,"more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more"
17806,17807,As you like it,61.0,4.1.135,ROSALIND,"new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires"
17807,17808,As you like it,61.0,4.1.136,ROSALIND,"than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana"
17808,17809,As you like it,61.0,4.1.137,ROSALIND,"in the fountain, and I will do that when you are"
17809,17810,As you like it,61.0,4.1.138,ROSALIND,"disposed to be merry, I will laugh like a hyen, and"
17810,17811,As you like it,61.0,4.1.139,ROSALIND,that when thou art inclined to sleep.
17811,17812,As you like it,62.0,4.1.140,ORLANDO,But will my Rosalind do so?
17812,17813,As you like it,63.0,4.1.141,ROSALIND,"By my life, she will do as I do."
17813,17814,As you like it,64.0,4.1.142,ORLANDO,"O, but she is wise."
17814,17815,As you like it,65.0,4.1.143,ROSALIND,Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
17815,17816,As you like it,65.0,4.1.144,ROSALIND,"wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's"
17816,17817,As you like it,65.0,4.1.145,ROSALIND,"wit and it will out at the casement, shut that and"
17817,17818,As you like it,65.0,4.1.146,ROSALIND,"'twill out at the key-hole, stop that, 'twill fly"
17818,17819,As you like it,65.0,4.1.147,ROSALIND,with the smoke out at the chimney.
17819,17820,As you like it,66.0,4.1.148,ORLANDO,"A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say"

17821,17822,As you like it,67.0,4.1.150,ROSALIND,"Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met"
17822,17823,As you like it,67.0,4.1.151,ROSALIND,your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
17823,17824,As you like it,68.0,4.1.152,ORLANDO,And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
17824,17825,As you like it,69.0,4.1.153,ROSALIND,"Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall"
17825,17826,As you like it,69.0,4.1.154,ROSALIND,"never take her without her answer, unless you take"
17826,17827,As you like it,69.0,4.1.155,ROSALIND,"her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot"
17827,17828,As you like it,69.0,4.1.156,ROSALIND,"make her fault her husband's occasion, let her"
17828,17829,As you like it,69.0,4.1.157,ROSALIND,"never nurse her child herself, for she will breed"

17830,17831,As you like it,70.0,4.1.159,ORLANDO,"For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee."
17831,17832,As you like it,71.0,4.1.160,ROSALIND,"Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours."
17832,17833,As you like it,72.0,4.1.161,ORLANDO,I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
17833,17834,As you like it,72.0,4.1.162,ORLANDO,will be with thee again.
17834,17835,As you like it,73.0,4.1.163,ROSALIND,"Ay, go your ways, go your ways, I knew what you"
17835,17836,As you like it,73.0,4.1.164,ROSALIND,"would prove: my friends told me as much, and I"
17836,17837,As you like it,73.0,4.1.165,ROSALIND,thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
17837,17838,As you like it,73.0,4.1.166,ROSALIND,"won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,"
17838,17839,As you like it,73.0,4.1.167,ROSALIND,death! Two o'clock is your hour?
17839,17840,As you like it,74.0,4.1.168,ORLANDO,"Ay, sweet Rosalind."
17840,17841,As you like it,75.0,4.1.169,ROSALIND,"By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend"

17842,17843,As you like it,75.0,4.1.171,ROSALIND,if you break one jot of your promise or come one
17843,17844,As you like it,75.0,4.1.172,ROSALIND,"minute behind your hour, I will think you the most"
17844,17845,As you like it,75.0,4.1.173,ROSALIND,pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
17845,17846,As you like it,75.0,4.1.174,ROSALIND,and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
17846,17847,As you like it,75.0,4.1.175,ROSALIND,may be chosen out of the gross band of the
17847,17848,As you like it,75.0,4.1.176,ROSALIND,unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep

17849,17850,As you like it,76.0,4.1.178,ORLANDO,With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
17850,17851,As you like it,76.0,4.1.179,ORLANDO,Rosalind: so adieu.
17851,17852,As you like it,77.0,4.1.180,ROSALIND,"Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such"

17854,17855,As you like it,78.0,4.1.182,CELIA,You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
17855,17856,As you like it,78.0,4.1.183,CELIA,we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
17856,17857,As you like it,78.0,4.1.184,CELIA,"head, and show the world what the bird hath done to"
17857,17858,As you like it,78.0,4.1.185,CELIA,her own nest.
17858,17859,As you like it,79.0,4.1.186,ROSALIND,"O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou"
17859,17860,As you like it,79.0,4.1.187,ROSALIND,didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
17860,17861,As you like it,79.0,4.1.188,ROSALIND,it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
17861,17862,As you like it,79.0,4.1.189,ROSALIND,"bottom, like the bay of Portugal."
17862,17863,As you like it,80.0,4.1.190,CELIA,"Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour"
17863,17864,As you like it,80.0,4.1.191,CELIA,"affection in, it runs out."
17864,17865,As you like it,81.0,4.1.192,ROSALIND,"No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot"
17865,17866,As you like it,81.0,4.1.193,ROSALIND,"of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,"
17866,17867,As you like it,81.0,4.1.194,ROSALIND,that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
17867,17868,As you like it,81.0,4.1.195,ROSALIND,"because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I"
17868,17869,As you like it,81.0,4.1.196,ROSALIND,"am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out"
17869,17870,As you like it,81.0,4.1.197,ROSALIND,of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
17870,17871,As you like it,81.0,4.1.198,ROSALIND,sigh till he come.
17871,17872,As you like it,82.0,4.1.199,CELIA,And I'll sleep.

17877,17878,As you like it,3.0,4.2.3,JAQUES,"Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman"
17878,17879,As you like it,3.0,4.2.4,JAQUES,"conqueror, and it would do well to set the deer's"
17879,17880,As you like it,3.0,4.2.5,JAQUES,"horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have"
17880,17881,As you like it,3.0,4.2.6,JAQUES,"you no song, forester, for this purpose?"
17881,17882,As you like it,4.0,4.2.7,Forester,"Yes, sir."

17890,17891,As you like it,6.0,4.2.15,Forester,It was a crest ere thou wast born:

17892,17893,As you like it,6.0,4.2.17,Forester,And thy father bore it:

17894,17895,As you like it,6.0,4.2.19,Forester,Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.

17898,17899,As you like it,1.0,4.3.1,ROSALIND,How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
17899,17900,As you like it,1.0,4.3.2,ROSALIND,here much Orlando!
17900,17901,As you like it,2.0,4.3.3,CELIA,"I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he"
17901,17902,As you like it,2.0,4.3.4,CELIA,hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
17902,17903,As you like it,2.0,4.3.5,CELIA,"sleep. Look, who comes here."
17903,17904,As you like it,2.0,,CELIA,Enter SILVIUS
17904,17905,As you like it,3.0,4.3.6,SILVIUS,"My errand is to you, fair youth,"
17905,17906,As you like it,3.0,4.3.7,SILVIUS,My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
17906,17907,As you like it,3.0,4.3.8,SILVIUS,"I know not the contents, but, as I guess"
17907,17908,As you like it,3.0,4.3.9,SILVIUS,By the stern brow and waspish action
17908,17909,As you like it,3.0,4.3.10,SILVIUS,"Which she did use as she was writing of it,"
17909,17910,As you like it,3.0,4.3.11,SILVIUS,It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
17910,17911,As you like it,3.0,4.3.12,SILVIUS,I am but as a guiltless messenger.
17911,17912,As you like it,4.0,4.3.13,ROSALIND,Patience herself would startle at this letter
17912,17913,As you like it,4.0,4.3.14,ROSALIND,"And play the swaggerer, bear this, bear all:"
17913,17914,As you like it,4.0,4.3.15,ROSALIND,"She says I am not fair, that I lack manners,"
17914,17915,As you like it,4.0,4.3.16,ROSALIND,"She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,"
17915,17916,As you like it,4.0,4.3.17,ROSALIND,Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
17916,17917,As you like it,4.0,4.3.18,ROSALIND,Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
17917,17918,As you like it,4.0,4.3.19,ROSALIND,"Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,"
17918,17919,As you like it,4.0,4.3.20,ROSALIND,This is a letter of your own device.
17919,17920,As you like it,5.0,4.3.21,SILVIUS,"No, I protest, I know not the contents:"
17920,17921,As you like it,5.0,4.3.22,SILVIUS,Phebe did write it.
17921,17922,As you like it,6.0,4.3.23,ROSALIND,"Come, come, you are a fool"
17922,17923,As you like it,6.0,4.3.24,ROSALIND,And turn'd into the extremity of love.
17923,17924,As you like it,6.0,4.3.25,ROSALIND,I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
17924,17925,As you like it,6.0,4.3.26,ROSALIND,"A freestone-colour'd hand, I verily did think"
17925,17926,As you like it,6.0,4.3.27,ROSALIND,"That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:"
17926,17927,As you like it,6.0,4.3.28,ROSALIND,"She has a huswife's hand, but that's no matter:"
17927,17928,As you like it,6.0,4.3.29,ROSALIND,"I say she never did invent this letter,"
17928,17929,As you like it,6.0,4.3.30,ROSALIND,This is a man's invention and his hand.
17929,17930,As you like it,7.0,4.3.31,SILVIUS,"Sure, it is hers."
17930,17931,As you like it,8.0,4.3.32,ROSALIND,"Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style."
17931,17932,As you like it,8.0,4.3.33,ROSALIND,"A style for-challengers, why, she defies me,"
17932,17933,As you like it,8.0,4.3.34,ROSALIND,Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
17933,17934,As you like it,8.0,4.3.35,ROSALIND,Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
17934,17935,As you like it,8.0,4.3.36,ROSALIND,"Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect"
17935,17936,As you like it,8.0,4.3.37,ROSALIND,Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
17936,17937,As you like it,9.0,4.3.38,SILVIUS,"So please you, for I never heard it yet,"
17937,17938,As you like it,9.0,4.3.39,SILVIUS,Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
17938,17939,As you like it,10.0,4.3.40,ROSALIND,She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
17939,17940,As you like it,10.0,,ROSALIND,Reads
17940,17941,As you like it,10.0,4.3.41,ROSALIND,"Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,"
17941,17942,As you like it,10.0,4.3.42,ROSALIND,That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
17942,17943,As you like it,10.0,4.3.43,ROSALIND,Can a woman rail thus?
17943,17944,As you like it,11.0,4.3.44,SILVIUS,Call you this railing?
17944,17945,As you like it,12.0,4.3.45,ROSALIND,[Reads]
17945,17946,As you like it,12.0,4.3.46,ROSALIND,"Why, thy godhead laid apart,"
17946,17947,As you like it,12.0,4.3.47,ROSALIND,Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
17947,17948,As you like it,12.0,4.3.48,ROSALIND,Did you ever hear such railing?
17948,17949,As you like it,12.0,4.3.49,ROSALIND,"Whiles the eye of man did woo me,"
17949,17950,As you like it,12.0,4.3.50,ROSALIND,That could do no vengeance to me.
17950,17951,As you like it,12.0,4.3.51,ROSALIND,Meaning me a beast.
17951,17952,As you like it,12.0,4.3.52,ROSALIND,If the scorn of your bright eyne
17952,17953,As you like it,12.0,4.3.53,ROSALIND,"Have power to raise such love in mine,"
17953,17954,As you like it,12.0,4.3.54,ROSALIND,"Alack, in me what strange effect"
17954,17955,As you like it,12.0,4.3.55,ROSALIND,Would they work in mild aspect!
17955,17956,As you like it,12.0,4.3.56,ROSALIND,"Whiles you chid me, I did love,"
17956,17957,As you like it,12.0,4.3.57,ROSALIND,How then might your prayers move!
17957,17958,As you like it,12.0,4.3.58,ROSALIND,He that brings this love to thee
17958,17959,As you like it,12.0,4.3.59,ROSALIND,Little knows this love in me:
17959,17960,As you like it,12.0,4.3.60,ROSALIND,"And by him seal up thy mind,"
17960,17961,As you like it,12.0,4.3.61,ROSALIND,Whether that thy youth and kind
17961,17962,As you like it,12.0,4.3.62,ROSALIND,Will the faithful offer take
17962,17963,As you like it,12.0,4.3.63,ROSALIND,"Of me and all that I can make,"
17963,17964,As you like it,12.0,4.3.64,ROSALIND,"Or else by him my love deny,"
17964,17965,As you like it,12.0,4.3.65,ROSALIND,And then I'll study how to die.
17965,17966,As you like it,13.0,4.3.66,SILVIUS,Call you this chiding?
17966,17967,As you like it,14.0,4.3.67,CELIA,"Alas, poor shepherd!"
17967,17968,As you like it,15.0,4.3.68,ROSALIND,"Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt"
17968,17969,As you like it,15.0,4.3.69,ROSALIND,"thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an"
17969,17970,As you like it,15.0,4.3.70,ROSALIND,instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
17970,17971,As you like it,15.0,4.3.71,ROSALIND,"be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see"
17971,17972,As you like it,15.0,4.3.72,ROSALIND,"love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to"
17972,17973,As you like it,15.0,4.3.73,ROSALIND,"her: that if she love me, I charge her to love"
17973,17974,As you like it,15.0,4.3.74,ROSALIND,"thee, if she will not, I will never have her unless"
17974,17975,As you like it,15.0,4.3.75,ROSALIND,"thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,"
17975,17976,As you like it,15.0,4.3.76,ROSALIND,"hence, and not a word, for here comes more company."
17976,17977,As you like it,15.0,,ROSALIND,Exit SILVIUS
17977,17978,As you like it,15.0,,ROSALIND,Enter OLIVER
17978,17979,As you like it,16.0,4.3.77,OLIVER,"Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,"
17979,17980,As you like it,16.0,4.3.78,OLIVER,Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
17980,17981,As you like it,16.0,4.3.79,OLIVER,A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
17981,17982,As you like it,17.0,4.3.80,CELIA,"West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:"
17982,17983,As you like it,17.0,4.3.81,CELIA,The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
17983,17984,As you like it,17.0,4.3.82,CELIA,Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
17984,17985,As you like it,17.0,4.3.83,CELIA,"But at this hour the house doth keep itself,"
17985,17986,As you like it,17.0,4.3.84,CELIA,There's none within.
17986,17987,As you like it,18.0,4.3.85,OLIVER,"If that an eye may profit by a tongue,"
17987,17988,As you like it,18.0,4.3.86,OLIVER,"Then should I know you by description,"
17988,17989,As you like it,18.0,4.3.87,OLIVER,"Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,"
17989,17990,As you like it,18.0,4.3.88,OLIVER,"Of female favour, and bestows himself"
17990,17991,As you like it,18.0,4.3.89,OLIVER,Like a ripe sister: the woman low
17991,17992,As you like it,18.0,4.3.90,OLIVER,And browner than her brother.' Are not you
17992,17993,As you like it,18.0,4.3.91,OLIVER,The owner of the house I did inquire for?
17993,17994,As you like it,19.0,4.3.92,CELIA,"It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are."
17994,17995,As you like it,20.0,4.3.93,OLIVER,"Orlando doth commend him to you both,"
17995,17996,As you like it,20.0,4.3.94,OLIVER,And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
17996,17997,As you like it,20.0,4.3.95,OLIVER,He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
17997,17998,As you like it,21.0,4.3.96,ROSALIND,I am: what must we understand by this?
17998,17999,As you like it,22.0,4.3.97,OLIVER,"Some of my shame, if you will know of me"

18000,18001,As you like it,22.0,4.3.99,OLIVER,This handkercher was stain'd.
18001,18002,As you like it,23.0,4.3.100,CELIA,"I pray you, tell it."
18002,18003,As you like it,24.0,4.3.101,OLIVER,When last the young Orlando parted from you
18003,18004,As you like it,24.0,4.3.102,OLIVER,He left a promise to return again
18004,18005,As you like it,24.0,4.3.103,OLIVER,"Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,"
18005,18006,As you like it,24.0,4.3.104,OLIVER,"Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,"
18006,18007,As you like it,24.0,4.3.105,OLIVER,"Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,"
18007,18008,As you like it,24.0,4.3.106,OLIVER,And mark what object did present itself:
18008,18009,As you like it,24.0,4.3.107,OLIVER,"Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age"
18009,18010,As you like it,24.0,4.3.108,OLIVER,"And high top bald with dry antiquity,"
18010,18011,As you like it,24.0,4.3.109,OLIVER,"A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,"
18011,18012,As you like it,24.0,4.3.110,OLIVER,Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
18012,18013,As you like it,24.0,4.3.111,OLIVER,"A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,"
18013,18014,As you like it,24.0,4.3.112,OLIVER,Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
18014,18015,As you like it,24.0,4.3.113,OLIVER,"The opening of his mouth, but suddenly,"
18015,18016,As you like it,24.0,4.3.114,OLIVER,"Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,"
18016,18017,As you like it,24.0,4.3.115,OLIVER,And with indented glides did slip away
18017,18018,As you like it,24.0,4.3.116,OLIVER,Into a bush: under which bush's shade
18018,18019,As you like it,24.0,4.3.117,OLIVER,"A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,"
18019,18020,As you like it,24.0,4.3.118,OLIVER,"Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,"
18020,18021,As you like it,24.0,4.3.119,OLIVER,"When that the sleeping man should stir, for 'tis"
18021,18022,As you like it,24.0,4.3.120,OLIVER,The royal disposition of that beast
18022,18023,As you like it,24.0,4.3.121,OLIVER,To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
18023,18024,As you like it,24.0,4.3.122,OLIVER,"This seen, Orlando did approach the man"
18024,18025,As you like it,24.0,4.3.123,OLIVER,"And found it was his brother, his elder brother."
18025,18026,As you like it,25.0,4.3.124,CELIA,"O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,"
18026,18027,As you like it,25.0,4.3.125,CELIA,And he did render him the most unnatural
18027,18028,As you like it,25.0,4.3.126,CELIA,That lived amongst men.

18036,18037,As you like it,28.0,4.3.135,OLIVER,Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
18037,18038,As you like it,28.0,4.3.136,OLIVER,From miserable slumber I awaked.

18050,18051,As you like it,34.0,4.3.149,OLIVER,"Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,"
18051,18052,As you like it,34.0,4.3.150,OLIVER,"Committing me unto my brother's love,"
18052,18053,As you like it,34.0,4.3.151,OLIVER,"Who led me instantly unto his cave,"

18054,18055,As you like it,34.0,4.3.153,OLIVER,"The lioness had torn some flesh away,"
18055,18056,As you like it,34.0,4.3.154,OLIVER,"Which all this while had bled, and now he fainted"
18056,18057,As you like it,34.0,4.3.155,OLIVER,"And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind."
18057,18058,As you like it,34.0,4.3.156,OLIVER,"Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,"
18058,18059,As you like it,34.0,4.3.157,OLIVER,"And, after some small space, being strong at heart,"
18059,18060,As you like it,34.0,4.3.158,OLIVER,"He sent me hither, stranger as I am,"
18060,18061,As you like it,34.0,4.3.159,OLIVER,"To tell this story, that you might excuse"
18061,18062,As you like it,34.0,4.3.160,OLIVER,"His broken promise, and to give this napkin"

18076,18077,As you like it,42.0,4.3.174,ROSALIND,your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
18077,18078,As you like it,43.0,4.3.175,OLIVER,This was not counterfeit: there is too great
18078,18079,As you like it,43.0,4.3.176,OLIVER,testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
18079,18080,As you like it,43.0,4.3.177,OLIVER,of earnest.
18080,18081,As you like it,44.0,4.3.178,ROSALIND,"Counterfeit, I assure you."

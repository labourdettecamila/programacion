88613,88614,Taming of the Shrew,8.0,0.1.15,Lord,"Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd,"
88614,88615,Taming of the Shrew,8.0,0.1.16,Lord,And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.

88617,88618,Taming of the Shrew,8.0,0.1.19,Lord,I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
88618,88619,Taming of the Shrew,9.0,0.1.20,First Huntsman,"Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord,"
88619,88620,Taming of the Shrew,9.0,0.1.21,First Huntsman,He cried upon it at the merest loss
88620,88621,Taming of the Shrew,9.0,0.1.22,First Huntsman,And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
88621,88622,Taming of the Shrew,9.0,0.1.23,First Huntsman,"Trust me, I take him for the better dog."
88622,88623,Taming of the Shrew,10.0,0.1.24,Lord,"Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,"
88623,88624,Taming of the Shrew,10.0,0.1.25,Lord,I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
88624,88625,Taming of the Shrew,10.0,0.1.26,Lord,But sup them well and look unto them all:
88625,88626,Taming of the Shrew,10.0,0.1.27,Lord,To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
88626,88627,Taming of the Shrew,11.0,0.1.28,First Huntsman,"I will, my lord."
88627,88628,Taming of the Shrew,12.0,0.1.29,Lord,"What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?"
88628,88629,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,0.1.30,Second Huntsman,"He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,"
88629,88630,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,0.1.31,Second Huntsman,This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
88630,88631,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,0.1.32,Lord,O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
88631,88632,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,0.1.33,Lord,"Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!"

88635,88636,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,0.1.37,Lord,"A most delicious banquet by his bed,"
88636,88637,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,0.1.38,Lord,"And brave attendants near him when he wakes,"
88637,88638,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,0.1.39,Lord,Would not the beggar then forget himself?
88638,88639,Taming of the Shrew,15.0,0.1.40,First Huntsman,"Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose."
88639,88640,Taming of the Shrew,16.0,0.1.41,Second Huntsman,It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
88640,88641,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.42,Lord,Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
88641,88642,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.43,Lord,Then take him up and manage well the jest:
88642,88643,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.44,Lord,Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
88643,88644,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.45,Lord,And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
88644,88645,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.46,Lord,Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
88645,88646,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.47,Lord,And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:

88647,88648,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.49,Lord,"To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound,"
88648,88649,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.50,Lord,"And if he chance to speak, be ready straight"
88649,88650,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.51,Lord,And with a low submissive reverence
88650,88651,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.52,Lord,Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
88651,88652,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.53,Lord,Let one attend him with a silver basin

88653,88654,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.55,Lord,"Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,"
88654,88655,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.56,Lord,And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
88655,88656,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.57,Lord,Some one be ready with a costly suit
88656,88657,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.58,Lord,"And ask him what apparel he will wear,"
88657,88658,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.59,Lord,"Another tell him of his hounds and horse,"
88658,88659,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.60,Lord,And that his lady mourns at his disease:
88659,88660,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.61,Lord,"Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,"
88660,88661,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.62,Lord,"And when he says he is, say that he dreams,"
88661,88662,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.63,Lord,For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
88662,88663,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.64,Lord,"This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:"
88663,88664,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.65,Lord,"It will be pastime passing excellent,"
88664,88665,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,0.1.66,Lord,If it be husbanded with modesty.
88665,88666,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,0.1.67,First Huntsman,"My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,"
88666,88667,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,0.1.68,First Huntsman,As he shall think by our true diligence
88667,88668,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,0.1.69,First Huntsman,He is no less than what we say he is.
88668,88669,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,0.1.70,Lord,"Take him up gently and to bed with him,"
88669,88670,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,0.1.71,Lord,And each one to his office when he wakes.
88670,88671,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,,Lord,Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds
88671,88672,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,0.1.72,Lord,"Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:"

88685,88686,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,0.1.83,Lord,"With all my heart. This fellow I remember,"
88686,88687,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,0.1.84,Lord,Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:

88694,88695,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,0.1.92,Lord,Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
88695,88696,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,0.1.93,Lord,There is a lord will hear you play to-night:

88698,88699,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,0.1.96,Lord,For yet his honour never heard a play--

88700,88701,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,0.1.98,Lord,"And so offend him, for I tell you, sirs,"
88701,88702,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,0.1.99,Lord,If you should smile he grows impatient.
88702,88703,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,0.1.100,A Player,"Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,"
88703,88704,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,0.1.101,A Player,Were he the veriest antic in the world.

88716,88717,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.113,Lord,Such duty to the drunkard let him do
88717,88718,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.114,Lord,"With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,"
88718,88719,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.115,Lord,"And say 'What is't your honour will command,"
88719,88720,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.116,Lord,Wherein your lady and your humble wife

88726,88727,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.123,Lord,No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:

88728,88729,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.125,Lord,"To rain a shower of commanded tears,"
88729,88730,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.126,Lord,"An onion will do well for such a shift,"
88730,88731,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.127,Lord,Which in a napkin being close convey'd
88731,88732,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.128,Lord,Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
88732,88733,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.129,Lord,See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
88733,88734,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.130,Lord,Anon I'll give thee more instructions.

88741,88742,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.137,Lord,May well abate the over-merry spleen
88742,88743,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,0.1.138,Lord,Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

89104,89105,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.203,LUCENTIO,Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
89105,89106,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.204,LUCENTIO,"For man or master, then it follows thus,"
89106,89107,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.205,LUCENTIO,"Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,"
89107,89108,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.206,LUCENTIO,Keep house and port and servants as I should:
89108,89109,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.207,LUCENTIO,"I will some other be, some Florentine,"
89109,89110,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.208,LUCENTIO,"Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa."
89110,89111,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.209,LUCENTIO,"'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once"
89111,89112,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.210,LUCENTIO,"Uncase thee, take my colour'd hat and cloak:"
89112,89113,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.211,LUCENTIO,"When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,"
89113,89114,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.1.212,LUCENTIO,But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
89114,89115,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.213,TRANIO,So had you need.
89115,89116,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.214,TRANIO,"In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,"
89116,89117,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.215,TRANIO,"And I am tied to be obedient,"
89117,89118,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.216,TRANIO,"For so your father charged me at our parting,"
89118,89119,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.217,TRANIO,"'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,"
89119,89120,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.218,TRANIO,"Although I think 'twas in another sense,"
89120,89121,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.219,TRANIO,"I am content to be Lucentio,"
89121,89122,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.1.220,TRANIO,Because so well I love Lucentio.
89122,89123,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.1.221,LUCENTIO,"Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:"
89123,89124,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.1.222,LUCENTIO,"And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid"
89124,89125,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.1.223,LUCENTIO,Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
89125,89126,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.1.224,LUCENTIO,Here comes the rogue.
89126,89127,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,,LUCENTIO,Enter BIONDELLO
89127,89128,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.1.225,LUCENTIO,"Sirrah, where have you been?"
89128,89129,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,1.1.226,BIONDELLO,"Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?"
89129,89130,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,1.1.227,BIONDELLO,"Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or"
89130,89131,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,1.1.228,BIONDELLO,"you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?"
89131,89132,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.229,LUCENTIO,"Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,"
89132,89133,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.230,LUCENTIO,And therefore frame your manners to the time.
89133,89134,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.231,LUCENTIO,"Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,"
89134,89135,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.232,LUCENTIO,"Puts my apparel and my countenance on,"
89135,89136,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.233,LUCENTIO,"And I for my escape have put on his,"
89136,89137,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.234,LUCENTIO,For in a quarrel since I came ashore
89137,89138,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.235,LUCENTIO,I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
89138,89139,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.236,LUCENTIO,"Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,"
89139,89140,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.237,LUCENTIO,While I make way from hence to save my life:
89140,89141,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.1.238,LUCENTIO,You understand me?
89141,89142,Taming of the Shrew,56.0,1.1.239,BIONDELLO,"I, sir! ne'er a whit."
89142,89143,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,1.1.240,LUCENTIO,And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
89143,89144,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,1.1.241,LUCENTIO,Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
89144,89145,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,1.1.242,BIONDELLO,The better for him: would I were so too!
89145,89146,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,1.1.243,TRANIO,"So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,"
89146,89147,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,1.1.244,TRANIO,That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
89147,89148,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,1.1.245,TRANIO,"But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise"
89148,89149,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,1.1.246,TRANIO,You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
89149,89150,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,1.1.247,TRANIO,"When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio,"
89150,89151,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,1.1.248,TRANIO,But in all places else your master Lucentio.
89151,89152,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,1.1.249,LUCENTIO,"Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that"
89152,89153,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,1.1.250,LUCENTIO,"thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if"
89153,89154,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,1.1.251,LUCENTIO,"thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good"
89154,89155,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,1.1.252,LUCENTIO,and weighty.
89155,89156,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,,LUCENTIO,Exeunt

89159,89160,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,1.1.255,SLY,comes there any more of it?
89160,89161,Taming of the Shrew,63.0,1.1.256,Page,"My lord, 'tis but begun."
89161,89162,Taming of the Shrew,64.0,1.1.257,SLY,"'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:"

89174,89175,Taming of the Shrew,4.0,1.2.9,GRUMIO,"Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that"
89175,89176,Taming of the Shrew,4.0,1.2.10,GRUMIO,"I should knock you here, sir?"
89176,89177,Taming of the Shrew,5.0,1.2.11,PETRUCHIO,"Villain, I say, knock me at this gate"
89177,89178,Taming of the Shrew,5.0,1.2.12,PETRUCHIO,"And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate."
89178,89179,Taming of the Shrew,6.0,1.2.13,GRUMIO,My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
89179,89180,Taming of the Shrew,6.0,1.2.14,GRUMIO,"you first,"
89180,89181,Taming of the Shrew,6.0,1.2.15,GRUMIO,And then I know after who comes by the worst.
89181,89182,Taming of the Shrew,7.0,1.2.16,PETRUCHIO,Will it not be?
89182,89183,Taming of the Shrew,7.0,1.2.17,PETRUCHIO,"Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it,"
89183,89184,Taming of the Shrew,7.0,1.2.18,PETRUCHIO,"I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it."

89190,89191,Taming of the Shrew,11.0,1.2.23,PETRUCHIO,"Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?"
89191,89192,Taming of the Shrew,11.0,1.2.24,PETRUCHIO,"'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say."
89192,89193,Taming of the Shrew,12.0,1.2.25,HORTENSIO,"'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor"
89193,89194,Taming of the Shrew,12.0,1.2.26,HORTENSIO,"mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound"
89194,89195,Taming of the Shrew,12.0,1.2.27,HORTENSIO,this quarrel.
89195,89196,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,1.2.28,GRUMIO,"Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin."
89196,89197,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,1.2.29,GRUMIO,if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his

89199,89200,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,1.2.32,GRUMIO,"use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,"
89200,89201,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,1.2.33,GRUMIO,"two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had"
89201,89202,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,1.2.34,GRUMIO,"well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst."
89202,89203,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,1.2.35,PETRUCHIO,"A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,"
89203,89204,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,1.2.36,PETRUCHIO,I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
89204,89205,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,1.2.37,PETRUCHIO,And could not get him for my heart to do it.
89205,89206,Taming of the Shrew,15.0,1.2.38,GRUMIO,Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
89206,89207,Taming of the Shrew,15.0,1.2.39,GRUMIO,"words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,"
89207,89208,Taming of the Shrew,15.0,1.2.40,GRUMIO,"knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you"

89211,89212,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,1.2.44,HORTENSIO,"Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,"
89212,89213,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,1.2.45,HORTENSIO,"Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio."
89213,89214,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,1.2.46,HORTENSIO,"And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale"
89214,89215,Taming of the Shrew,17.0,1.2.47,HORTENSIO,Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
89215,89216,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.48,PETRUCHIO,"Such wind as scatters young men through the world,"
89216,89217,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.49,PETRUCHIO,To seek their fortunes farther than at home
89217,89218,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.50,PETRUCHIO,"Where small experience grows. But in a few,"
89218,89219,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.51,PETRUCHIO,"Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:"
89219,89220,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.52,PETRUCHIO,"Antonio, my father, is deceased,"
89220,89221,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.53,PETRUCHIO,"And I have thrust myself into this maze,"
89221,89222,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.54,PETRUCHIO,Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
89222,89223,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.55,PETRUCHIO,"Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,"
89223,89224,Taming of the Shrew,18.0,1.2.56,PETRUCHIO,And so am come abroad to see the world.
89224,89225,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,1.2.57,HORTENSIO,"Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee"
89225,89226,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,1.2.58,HORTENSIO,And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
89226,89227,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,1.2.59,HORTENSIO,Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
89227,89228,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,1.2.60,HORTENSIO,And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
89228,89229,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,1.2.61,HORTENSIO,"And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,"
89229,89230,Taming of the Shrew,19.0,1.2.62,HORTENSIO,And I'll not wish thee to her.
89230,89231,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.63,PETRUCHIO,"Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we"
89231,89232,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.64,PETRUCHIO,"Few words suffice, and therefore, if thou know"
89232,89233,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.65,PETRUCHIO,"One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,"
89233,89234,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.66,PETRUCHIO,"As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,"
89234,89235,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.67,PETRUCHIO,"Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,"
89235,89236,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.68,PETRUCHIO,As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
89236,89237,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.69,PETRUCHIO,"As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,"
89237,89238,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.70,PETRUCHIO,"She moves me not, or not removes, at least,"
89238,89239,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.71,PETRUCHIO,"Affection's edge in me, were she as rough"
89239,89240,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.72,PETRUCHIO,As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
89240,89241,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.73,PETRUCHIO,"I come to wive it wealthily in Padua,"
89241,89242,Taming of the Shrew,20.0,1.2.74,PETRUCHIO,"If wealthily, then happily in Padua."
89242,89243,Taming of the Shrew,21.0,1.2.75,GRUMIO,"Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his"
89243,89244,Taming of the Shrew,21.0,1.2.76,GRUMIO,mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
89244,89245,Taming of the Shrew,21.0,1.2.77,GRUMIO,"a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er"
89245,89246,Taming of the Shrew,21.0,1.2.78,GRUMIO,"a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases"
89246,89247,Taming of the Shrew,21.0,1.2.79,GRUMIO,"as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,"
89247,89248,Taming of the Shrew,21.0,1.2.80,GRUMIO,so money comes withal.
89248,89249,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.81,HORTENSIO,"Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,"
89249,89250,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.82,HORTENSIO,I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
89250,89251,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.83,HORTENSIO,"I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife"
89251,89252,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.84,HORTENSIO,"With wealth enough and young and beauteous,"
89252,89253,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.85,HORTENSIO,Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
89253,89254,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.86,HORTENSIO,"Her only fault, and that is faults enough,"
89254,89255,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.87,HORTENSIO,Is that she is intolerable curst
89255,89256,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.88,HORTENSIO,"And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure"
89256,89257,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.89,HORTENSIO,"That, were my state far worser than it is,"
89257,89258,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,1.2.90,HORTENSIO,I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
89258,89259,Taming of the Shrew,23.0,1.2.91,PETRUCHIO,"Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:"
89259,89260,Taming of the Shrew,23.0,1.2.92,PETRUCHIO,"Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough,"
89260,89261,Taming of the Shrew,23.0,1.2.93,PETRUCHIO,"For I will board her, though she chide as loud"
89261,89262,Taming of the Shrew,23.0,1.2.94,PETRUCHIO,As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
89262,89263,Taming of the Shrew,24.0,1.2.95,HORTENSIO,"Her father is Baptista Minola,"
89263,89264,Taming of the Shrew,24.0,1.2.96,HORTENSIO,An affable and courteous gentleman:
89264,89265,Taming of the Shrew,24.0,1.2.97,HORTENSIO,"Her name is Katharina Minola,"
89265,89266,Taming of the Shrew,24.0,1.2.98,HORTENSIO,Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
89266,89267,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,1.2.99,PETRUCHIO,"I know her father, though I know not her,"
89267,89268,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,1.2.100,PETRUCHIO,And he knew my deceased father well.
89268,89269,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,1.2.101,PETRUCHIO,"I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,"
89269,89270,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,1.2.102,PETRUCHIO,And therefore let me be thus bold with you
89270,89271,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,1.2.103,PETRUCHIO,"To give you over at this first encounter,"
89271,89272,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,1.2.104,PETRUCHIO,Unless you will accompany me thither.
89272,89273,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.105,GRUMIO,"I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts."
89273,89274,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.106,GRUMIO,"O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she"
89274,89275,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.107,GRUMIO,would think scolding would do little good upon him:
89275,89276,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.108,GRUMIO,she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
89276,89277,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.109,GRUMIO,"why, that's nothing, an he begin once, he'll rail in"
89277,89278,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.110,GRUMIO,"his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she"
89278,89279,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.111,GRUMIO,"stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in"
89279,89280,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.112,GRUMIO,her face and so disfigure her with it that she
89280,89281,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.113,GRUMIO,shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
89281,89282,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,1.2.114,GRUMIO,"You know him not, sir."
89282,89283,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.115,HORTENSIO,"Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,"
89283,89284,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.116,HORTENSIO,For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
89284,89285,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.117,HORTENSIO,"He hath the jewel of my life in hold,"
89285,89286,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.118,HORTENSIO,"His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,"
89286,89287,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.119,HORTENSIO,"And her withholds from me and other more,"
89287,89288,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.120,HORTENSIO,"Suitors to her and rivals in my love,"
89288,89289,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.121,HORTENSIO,"Supposing it a thing impossible,"
89289,89290,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.122,HORTENSIO,"For those defects I have before rehearsed,"
89290,89291,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.123,HORTENSIO,"That ever Katharina will be woo'd,"
89291,89292,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.124,HORTENSIO,"Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,"
89292,89293,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.125,HORTENSIO,That none shall have access unto Bianca
89293,89294,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,1.2.126,HORTENSIO,Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
89294,89295,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,1.2.127,GRUMIO,Katharina the curst!
89295,89296,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,1.2.128,GRUMIO,A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
89296,89297,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,1.2.129,HORTENSIO,"Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,"
89297,89298,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,1.2.130,HORTENSIO,And offer me disguised in sober robes
89298,89299,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,1.2.131,HORTENSIO,To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
89299,89300,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,1.2.132,HORTENSIO,"Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,"
89300,89301,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,1.2.133,HORTENSIO,"That so I may, by this device, at least"
89301,89302,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,1.2.134,HORTENSIO,Have leave and leisure to make love to her
89302,89303,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,1.2.135,HORTENSIO,And unsuspected court her by herself.
89303,89304,Taming of the Shrew,30.0,1.2.136,GRUMIO,"Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,"
89304,89305,Taming of the Shrew,30.0,1.2.137,GRUMIO,how the young folks lay their heads together!
89305,89306,Taming of the Shrew,30.0,,GRUMIO,"Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised"
89306,89307,Taming of the Shrew,30.0,1.2.138,GRUMIO,"Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?"
89307,89308,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,1.2.139,HORTENSIO,"Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love."
89308,89309,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,1.2.140,HORTENSIO,"Petruchio, stand by a while."
89309,89310,Taming of the Shrew,32.0,1.2.141,GRUMIO,A proper stripling and an amorous!
89310,89311,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.142,GREMIO,"O, very well, I have perused the note."
89311,89312,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.143,GREMIO,"Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:"
89312,89313,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.144,GREMIO,"All books of love, see that at any hand,"
89313,89314,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.145,GREMIO,And see you read no other lectures to her:
89314,89315,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.146,GREMIO,You understand me: over and beside
89315,89316,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.147,GREMIO,"Signior Baptista's liberality,"
89316,89317,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.148,GREMIO,"I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,"
89317,89318,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.149,GREMIO,And let me have them very well perfumed
89318,89319,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.150,GREMIO,For she is sweeter than perfume itself
89319,89320,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,1.2.151,GREMIO,To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
89320,89321,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,1.2.152,LUCENTIO,"Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you"
89321,89322,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,1.2.153,LUCENTIO,"As for my patron, stand you so assured,"
89322,89323,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,1.2.154,LUCENTIO,As firmly as yourself were still in place:
89323,89324,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,1.2.155,LUCENTIO,"Yea, and perhaps with more successful words"
89324,89325,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,1.2.156,LUCENTIO,"Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir."
89325,89326,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,1.2.157,GREMIO,"O this learning, what a thing it is!"
89326,89327,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,1.2.158,GRUMIO,"O this woodcock, what an ass it is!"
89327,89328,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,1.2.159,PETRUCHIO,"Peace, sirrah!"
89328,89329,Taming of the Shrew,38.0,1.2.160,HORTENSIO,"Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio."
89329,89330,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.161,GREMIO,"And you are well met, Signior Hortensio."
89330,89331,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.162,GREMIO,Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
89331,89332,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.163,GREMIO,I promised to inquire carefully
89332,89333,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.164,GREMIO,About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
89333,89334,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.165,GREMIO,And by good fortune I have lighted well
89334,89335,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.166,GREMIO,"On this young man, for learning and behavior"
89335,89336,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.167,GREMIO,"Fit for her turn, well read in poetry"
89336,89337,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,1.2.168,GREMIO,"And other books, good ones, I warrant ye."
89337,89338,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,1.2.169,HORTENSIO,"'Tis well, and I have met a gentleman"
89338,89339,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,1.2.170,HORTENSIO,"Hath promised me to help me to another,"
89339,89340,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,1.2.171,HORTENSIO,"A fine musician to instruct our mistress,"
89340,89341,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,1.2.172,HORTENSIO,So shall I no whit be behind in duty
89341,89342,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,1.2.173,HORTENSIO,"To fair Bianca, so beloved of me."
89342,89343,Taming of the Shrew,41.0,1.2.174,GREMIO,"Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove."
89343,89344,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,1.2.175,GRUMIO,And that his bags shall prove.
89344,89345,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,1.2.176,HORTENSIO,"Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:"
89345,89346,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,1.2.177,HORTENSIO,"Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,"
89346,89347,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,1.2.178,HORTENSIO,I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
89347,89348,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,1.2.179,HORTENSIO,"Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,"
89348,89349,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,1.2.180,HORTENSIO,"Upon agreement from us to his liking,"
89349,89350,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,1.2.181,HORTENSIO,"Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,"
89350,89351,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,1.2.182,HORTENSIO,"Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please."
89351,89352,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,1.2.183,GREMIO,"So said, so done, is well."
89352,89353,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,1.2.184,GREMIO,"Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?"
89353,89354,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,1.2.185,PETRUCHIO,I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
89354,89355,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,1.2.186,PETRUCHIO,"If that be all, masters, I hear no harm."
89355,89356,Taming of the Shrew,46.0,1.2.187,GREMIO,"No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?"
89356,89357,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,1.2.188,PETRUCHIO,"Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:"
89357,89358,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,1.2.189,PETRUCHIO,"My father dead, my fortune lives for me,"
89358,89359,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,1.2.190,PETRUCHIO,And I do hope good days and long to see.
89359,89360,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,1.2.191,GREMIO,"O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!"
89360,89361,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,1.2.192,GREMIO,"But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:"
89361,89362,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,1.2.193,GREMIO,You shall have me assisting you in all.
89362,89363,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,1.2.194,GREMIO,But will you woo this wild-cat?
89363,89364,Taming of the Shrew,49.0,1.2.195,PETRUCHIO,Will I live?
89364,89365,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,1.2.196,GRUMIO,"Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her."
89365,89366,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.197,PETRUCHIO,Why came I hither but to that intent?
89366,89367,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.198,PETRUCHIO,Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
89367,89368,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.199,PETRUCHIO,Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
89368,89369,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.200,PETRUCHIO,Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
89369,89370,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.201,PETRUCHIO,Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
89370,89371,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.202,PETRUCHIO,"Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,"
89371,89372,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.203,PETRUCHIO,And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
89372,89373,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.204,PETRUCHIO,Have I not in a pitched battle heard
89373,89374,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.205,PETRUCHIO,"Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?"
89374,89375,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.206,PETRUCHIO,"And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,"
89375,89376,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.207,PETRUCHIO,That gives not half so great a blow to hear
89376,89377,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.208,PETRUCHIO,As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
89377,89378,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,1.2.209,PETRUCHIO,"Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs."
89378,89379,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,1.2.210,GRUMIO,For he fears none.
89379,89380,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.2.211,GREMIO,"Hortensio, hark:"
89380,89381,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.2.212,GREMIO,"This gentleman is happily arrived,"
89381,89382,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,1.2.213,GREMIO,"My mind presumes, for his own good and ours."
89382,89383,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,1.2.214,HORTENSIO,I promised we would be contributors
89383,89384,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,1.2.215,HORTENSIO,"And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er."
89384,89385,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,1.2.216,GREMIO,"And so we will, provided that he win her."
89385,89386,Taming of the Shrew,56.0,1.2.217,GRUMIO,I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
89386,89387,Taming of the Shrew,56.0,,GRUMIO,"Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO"
89387,89388,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,1.2.218,TRANIO,"Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,"
89388,89389,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,1.2.219,TRANIO,"Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way"
89389,89390,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,1.2.220,TRANIO,To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
89390,89391,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,1.2.221,BIONDELLO,He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
89391,89392,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,1.2.222,TRANIO,"Even he, Biondello."
89392,89393,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,1.2.223,GREMIO,"Hark you, sir, you mean not her to--"
89393,89394,Taming of the Shrew,61.0,1.2.224,TRANIO,"Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?"
89394,89395,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,1.2.225,PETRUCHIO,"Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray."
89395,89396,Taming of the Shrew,63.0,1.2.226,TRANIO,"I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away."
89396,89397,Taming of the Shrew,64.0,1.2.227,LUCENTIO,"Well begun, Tranio."
89397,89398,Taming of the Shrew,65.0,1.2.228,HORTENSIO,"Sir, a word ere you go,"
89398,89399,Taming of the Shrew,65.0,1.2.229,HORTENSIO,"Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?"
89399,89400,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,1.2.230,TRANIO,"And if I be, sir, is it any offence?"
89400,89401,Taming of the Shrew,67.0,1.2.231,GREMIO,"No, if without more words you will get you hence."
89401,89402,Taming of the Shrew,68.0,1.2.232,TRANIO,"Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free"
89402,89403,Taming of the Shrew,68.0,1.2.233,TRANIO,For me as for you?
89403,89404,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,1.2.234,GREMIO,But so is not she.
89404,89405,Taming of the Shrew,70.0,1.2.235,TRANIO,"For what reason, I beseech you?"
89405,89406,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,1.2.236,GREMIO,"For this reason, if you'll know,"
89406,89407,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,1.2.237,GREMIO,That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
89407,89408,Taming of the Shrew,72.0,1.2.238,HORTENSIO,That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
89408,89409,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.239,TRANIO,"Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,"
89409,89410,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.240,TRANIO,"Do me this right, hear me with patience."
89410,89411,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.241,TRANIO,"Baptista is a noble gentleman,"
89411,89412,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.242,TRANIO,"To whom my father is not all unknown,"
89412,89413,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.243,TRANIO,"And were his daughter fairer than she is,"
89413,89414,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.244,TRANIO,She may more suitors have and me for one.
89414,89415,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.245,TRANIO,"Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers,"
89415,89416,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.246,TRANIO,Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
89416,89417,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.247,TRANIO,"And so she shall, Lucentio shall make one,"
89417,89418,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,1.2.248,TRANIO,Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
89418,89419,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,1.2.249,GREMIO,What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
89419,89420,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,1.2.250,LUCENTIO,"Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade."
89420,89421,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,1.2.251,PETRUCHIO,"Hortensio, to what end are all these words?"
89421,89422,Taming of the Shrew,77.0,1.2.252,HORTENSIO,"Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,"
89422,89423,Taming of the Shrew,77.0,1.2.253,HORTENSIO,Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
89423,89424,Taming of the Shrew,78.0,1.2.254,TRANIO,"No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,"
89424,89425,Taming of the Shrew,78.0,1.2.255,TRANIO,The one as famous for a scolding tongue

89594,89595,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,2.1.127,PETRUCHIO,In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
89595,89596,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,2.1.128,PETRUCHIO,"Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,"
89596,89597,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,2.1.129,PETRUCHIO,That covenants may be kept on either hand.
89597,89598,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,2.1.130,BAPTISTA,"Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,"
89598,89599,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,2.1.131,BAPTISTA,"That is, her love, for that is all in all."
89599,89600,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.132,PETRUCHIO,"Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,"
89600,89601,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.133,PETRUCHIO,"I am as peremptory as she proud-minded,"
89601,89602,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.134,PETRUCHIO,And where two raging fires meet together
89602,89603,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.135,PETRUCHIO,They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
89603,89604,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.136,PETRUCHIO,"Though little fire grows great with little wind,"
89604,89605,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.137,PETRUCHIO,Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
89605,89606,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.138,PETRUCHIO,"So I to her and so she yields to me,"
89606,89607,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,2.1.139,PETRUCHIO,For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
89607,89608,Taming of the Shrew,38.0,2.1.140,BAPTISTA,"Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!"
89608,89609,Taming of the Shrew,38.0,2.1.141,BAPTISTA,But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
89609,89610,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,2.1.142,PETRUCHIO,"Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,"
89610,89611,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,2.1.143,PETRUCHIO,"That shake not, though they blow perpetually."
89611,89612,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,,PETRUCHIO,"Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke"
89612,89613,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,2.1.144,BAPTISTA,"How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?"
89613,89614,Taming of the Shrew,41.0,2.1.145,HORTENSIO,"For fear, I promise you, if I look pale."
89614,89615,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,2.1.146,BAPTISTA,"What, will my daughter prove a good musician?"
89615,89616,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,2.1.147,HORTENSIO,I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
89616,89617,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,2.1.148,HORTENSIO,"Iron may hold with her, but never lutes."
89617,89618,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,2.1.149,BAPTISTA,"Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?"
89618,89619,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.150,HORTENSIO,"Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me."
89619,89620,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.151,HORTENSIO,"I did but tell her she mistook her frets,"
89620,89621,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.152,HORTENSIO,"And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,"
89621,89622,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.153,HORTENSIO,"When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,"
89622,89623,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.154,HORTENSIO,"'Frets, call you these?' quoth she, 'I'll fume"
89623,89624,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.155,HORTENSIO,with them:'
89624,89625,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.156,HORTENSIO,"And, with that word, she struck me on the head,"
89625,89626,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.157,HORTENSIO,"And through the instrument my pate made way,"
89626,89627,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.158,HORTENSIO,"And there I stood amazed for a while,"
89627,89628,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.159,HORTENSIO,"As on a pillory, looking through the lute,"
89628,89629,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.160,HORTENSIO,While she did call me rascal fiddler
89629,89630,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.161,HORTENSIO,"And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,"
89630,89631,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,2.1.162,HORTENSIO,As had she studied to misuse me so.
89631,89632,Taming of the Shrew,46.0,2.1.163,PETRUCHIO,"Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench,"
89632,89633,Taming of the Shrew,46.0,2.1.164,PETRUCHIO,I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
89633,89634,Taming of the Shrew,46.0,2.1.165,PETRUCHIO,"O, how I long to have some chat with her!"
89634,89635,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,2.1.166,BAPTISTA,"Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:"
89635,89636,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,2.1.167,BAPTISTA,"Proceed in practise with my younger daughter,"
89636,89637,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,2.1.168,BAPTISTA,She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
89637,89638,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,2.1.169,BAPTISTA,"Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,"
89638,89639,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,2.1.170,BAPTISTA,Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
89639,89640,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.171,PETRUCHIO,I pray you do.
89640,89641,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,,PETRUCHIO,Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
89641,89642,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.172,PETRUCHIO,"I will attend her here,"
89642,89643,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.173,PETRUCHIO,And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
89643,89644,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.174,PETRUCHIO,"Say that she rail, why then I'll tell her plain"
89644,89645,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.175,PETRUCHIO,She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
89645,89646,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.176,PETRUCHIO,"Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear"
89646,89647,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.177,PETRUCHIO,As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
89647,89648,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.178,PETRUCHIO,"Say she be mute and will not speak a word,"
89648,89649,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.179,PETRUCHIO,"Then I'll commend her volubility,"
89649,89650,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.180,PETRUCHIO,And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
89650,89651,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.181,PETRUCHIO,"If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,"
89651,89652,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.182,PETRUCHIO,As though she bid me stay by her a week:
89652,89653,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.183,PETRUCHIO,"If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day"
89653,89654,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.184,PETRUCHIO,When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
89654,89655,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.185,PETRUCHIO,"But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak."
89655,89656,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,,PETRUCHIO,Enter KATHARINA
89656,89657,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,2.1.186,PETRUCHIO,"Good morrow, Kate, for that's your name, I hear."
89657,89658,Taming of the Shrew,49.0,2.1.187,KATHARINA,"Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:"
89658,89659,Taming of the Shrew,49.0,2.1.188,KATHARINA,They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
89659,89660,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.189,PETRUCHIO,"You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,"
89660,89661,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.190,PETRUCHIO,"And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst,"
89661,89662,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.191,PETRUCHIO,"But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom"
89662,89663,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.192,PETRUCHIO,"Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,"
89663,89664,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.193,PETRUCHIO,"For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,"
89664,89665,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.194,PETRUCHIO,"Take this of me, Kate of my consolation,"
89665,89666,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.195,PETRUCHIO,"Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,"
89666,89667,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.196,PETRUCHIO,"Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,"
89667,89668,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.197,PETRUCHIO,"Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,"
89668,89669,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,2.1.198,PETRUCHIO,Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
89669,89670,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,2.1.199,KATHARINA,Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
89670,89671,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,2.1.200,KATHARINA,Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
89671,89672,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,2.1.201,KATHARINA,You were a moveable.
89672,89673,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,2.1.202,PETRUCHIO,"Why, what's a moveable?"
89673,89674,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,2.1.203,KATHARINA,A join'd-stool.
89674,89675,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,2.1.204,PETRUCHIO,"Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me."
89675,89676,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,2.1.205,KATHARINA,"Asses are made to bear, and so are you."
89676,89677,Taming of the Shrew,56.0,2.1.206,PETRUCHIO,"Women are made to bear, and so are you."
89677,89678,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,2.1.207,KATHARINA,"No such jade as you, if me you mean."
89678,89679,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,2.1.208,PETRUCHIO,"Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee,"
89679,89680,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,2.1.209,PETRUCHIO,"For, knowing thee to be but young and light--"
89680,89681,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,2.1.210,KATHARINA,"Too light for such a swain as you to catch,"
89681,89682,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,2.1.211,KATHARINA,And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
89682,89683,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,2.1.212,PETRUCHIO,Should be! should--buzz!
89683,89684,Taming of the Shrew,61.0,2.1.213,KATHARINA,"Well ta'en, and like a buzzard."
89684,89685,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,2.1.214,PETRUCHIO,O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
89685,89686,Taming of the Shrew,63.0,2.1.215,KATHARINA,"Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard."
89686,89687,Taming of the Shrew,64.0,2.1.216,PETRUCHIO,"Come, come, you wasp, i' faith, you are too angry."
89687,89688,Taming of the Shrew,65.0,2.1.217,KATHARINA,"If I be waspish, best beware my sting."
89688,89689,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,2.1.218,PETRUCHIO,"My remedy is then, to pluck it out."
89689,89690,Taming of the Shrew,67.0,2.1.219,KATHARINA,"Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,"
89690,89691,Taming of the Shrew,68.0,2.1.220,PETRUCHIO,Who knows not where a wasp does
89691,89692,Taming of the Shrew,68.0,2.1.221,PETRUCHIO,wear his sting? In his tail.
89692,89693,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,2.1.222,KATHARINA,In his tongue.
89693,89694,Taming of the Shrew,70.0,2.1.223,PETRUCHIO,Whose tongue?
89694,89695,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,2.1.224,KATHARINA,"Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell."
89695,89696,Taming of the Shrew,72.0,2.1.225,PETRUCHIO,"What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,"
89696,89697,Taming of the Shrew,72.0,2.1.226,PETRUCHIO,"Good Kate, I am a gentleman."
89697,89698,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,2.1.227,KATHARINA,That I'll try.
89698,89699,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,,KATHARINA,She strikes him
89699,89700,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,2.1.228,PETRUCHIO,"I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again."
89700,89701,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,2.1.229,KATHARINA,So may you lose your arms:
89701,89702,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,2.1.230,KATHARINA,"If you strike me, you are no gentleman,"
89702,89703,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,2.1.231,KATHARINA,"And if no gentleman, why then no arms."
89703,89704,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,2.1.232,PETRUCHIO,"A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!"
89704,89705,Taming of the Shrew,77.0,2.1.233,KATHARINA,What is your crest? a coxcomb?
89705,89706,Taming of the Shrew,78.0,2.1.234,PETRUCHIO,"A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen."
89706,89707,Taming of the Shrew,79.0,2.1.235,KATHARINA,"No cock of mine, you crow too like a craven."
89707,89708,Taming of the Shrew,80.0,2.1.236,PETRUCHIO,"Nay, come, Kate, come, you must not look so sour."
89708,89709,Taming of the Shrew,81.0,2.1.237,KATHARINA,"It is my fashion, when I see a crab."
89709,89710,Taming of the Shrew,82.0,2.1.238,PETRUCHIO,"Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour."
89710,89711,Taming of the Shrew,83.0,2.1.239,KATHARINA,"There is, there is."
89711,89712,Taming of the Shrew,84.0,2.1.240,PETRUCHIO,Then show it me.
89712,89713,Taming of the Shrew,85.0,2.1.241,KATHARINA,"Had I a glass, I would."
89713,89714,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,2.1.242,PETRUCHIO,"What, you mean my face?"
89714,89715,Taming of the Shrew,87.0,2.1.243,KATHARINA,Well aim'd of such a young one.
89715,89716,Taming of the Shrew,88.0,2.1.244,PETRUCHIO,"Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you."
89716,89717,Taming of the Shrew,89.0,2.1.245,KATHARINA,Yet you are wither'd.
89717,89718,Taming of the Shrew,90.0,2.1.246,PETRUCHIO,'Tis with cares.
89718,89719,Taming of the Shrew,91.0,2.1.247,KATHARINA,I care not.
89719,89720,Taming of the Shrew,92.0,2.1.248,PETRUCHIO,"Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so."
89720,89721,Taming of the Shrew,93.0,2.1.249,KATHARINA,"I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go."
89721,89722,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.250,PETRUCHIO,"No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle."
89722,89723,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.251,PETRUCHIO,"'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,"
89723,89724,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.252,PETRUCHIO,"And now I find report a very liar,"
89724,89725,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.253,PETRUCHIO,"For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,"
89725,89726,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.254,PETRUCHIO,"But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:"
89726,89727,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.255,PETRUCHIO,"Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,"
89727,89728,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.256,PETRUCHIO,"Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,"
89728,89729,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.257,PETRUCHIO,"Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,"
89729,89730,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.258,PETRUCHIO,"But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,"
89730,89731,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.259,PETRUCHIO,"With gentle conference, soft and affable."
89731,89732,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.260,PETRUCHIO,Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
89732,89733,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.261,PETRUCHIO,O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
89733,89734,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.262,PETRUCHIO,Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
89734,89735,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.263,PETRUCHIO,As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
89735,89736,Taming of the Shrew,94.0,2.1.264,PETRUCHIO,"O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt."
89736,89737,Taming of the Shrew,95.0,2.1.265,KATHARINA,"Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command."
89737,89738,Taming of the Shrew,96.0,2.1.266,PETRUCHIO,Did ever Dian so become a grove
89738,89739,Taming of the Shrew,96.0,2.1.267,PETRUCHIO,As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
89739,89740,Taming of the Shrew,96.0,2.1.268,PETRUCHIO,"O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,"
89740,89741,Taming of the Shrew,96.0,2.1.269,PETRUCHIO,And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
89741,89742,Taming of the Shrew,97.0,2.1.270,KATHARINA,Where did you study all this goodly speech?
89742,89743,Taming of the Shrew,98.0,2.1.271,PETRUCHIO,"It is extempore, from my mother-wit."
89743,89744,Taming of the Shrew,99.0,2.1.272,KATHARINA,A witty mother! witless else her son.
89744,89745,Taming of the Shrew,100.0,2.1.273,PETRUCHIO,Am I not wise?
89745,89746,Taming of the Shrew,101.0,2.1.274,KATHARINA,"Yes, keep you warm."
89746,89747,Taming of the Shrew,102.0,2.1.275,PETRUCHIO,"Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:"
89747,89748,Taming of the Shrew,102.0,2.1.276,PETRUCHIO,"And therefore, setting all this chat aside,"
89748,89749,Taming of the Shrew,102.0,2.1.277,PETRUCHIO,Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
89749,89750,Taming of the Shrew,102.0,2.1.278,PETRUCHIO,"That you shall be my wife, your dowry 'greed on,"
89750,89751,Taming of the Shrew,102.0,2.1.279,PETRUCHIO,"And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you."

89918,89919,Taming of the Shrew,5.0,3.1.17,BIANCA,To strive for that which resteth in my choice:

89975,89976,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,3.1.72,BIANCA,"Why, I am past my gamut long ago."
89976,89977,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,3.1.73,HORTENSIO,Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

89994,89995,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,3.1.88,HORTENSIO,But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
89995,89996,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,3.1.89,HORTENSIO,Methinks he looks as though he were in love:

89997,89998,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,3.1.91,HORTENSIO,"To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,"

90008,90009,Taming of the Shrew,1.0,3.2.6,BAPTISTA,To want the bridegroom when the priest attends

90014,90015,Taming of the Shrew,2.0,3.2.12,KATHARINA,Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
90015,90016,Taming of the Shrew,2.0,3.2.13,KATHARINA,"I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,"
90016,90017,Taming of the Shrew,2.0,3.2.14,KATHARINA,Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:

90077,90078,Taming of the Shrew,21.0,3.2.73,BIONDELLO,"Why, sir, he comes not."
90078,90079,Taming of the Shrew,22.0,3.2.74,BAPTISTA,Didst thou not say he comes?
90079,90080,Taming of the Shrew,23.0,3.2.75,BIONDELLO,Who? that Petruchio came?
90080,90081,Taming of the Shrew,24.0,3.2.76,BAPTISTA,"Ay, that Petruchio came."
90081,90082,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,3.2.77,BIONDELLO,"No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back."
90082,90083,Taming of the Shrew,26.0,3.2.78,BAPTISTA,"Why, that's all one."
90083,90084,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,3.2.79,BIONDELLO,"Nay, by Saint Jamy,"
90084,90085,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,3.2.80,BIONDELLO,"I hold you a penny,"
90085,90086,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,3.2.81,BIONDELLO,A horse and a man
90086,90087,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,3.2.82,BIONDELLO,"Is more than one,"
90087,90088,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,3.2.83,BIONDELLO,And yet not many.
90088,90089,Taming of the Shrew,27.0,,BIONDELLO,Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
90089,90090,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,3.2.84,PETRUCHIO,"Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?"
90090,90091,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,3.2.85,BAPTISTA,"You are welcome, sir."
90091,90092,Taming of the Shrew,30.0,3.2.86,PETRUCHIO,And yet I come not well.
90092,90093,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,3.2.87,BAPTISTA,And yet you halt not.
90093,90094,Taming of the Shrew,32.0,3.2.88,TRANIO,Not so well apparell'd
90094,90095,Taming of the Shrew,32.0,3.2.89,TRANIO,As I wish you were.
90095,90096,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,3.2.90,PETRUCHIO,"Were it better, I should rush in thus."
90096,90097,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,3.2.91,PETRUCHIO,But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
90097,90098,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,3.2.92,PETRUCHIO,"How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:"
90098,90099,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,3.2.93,PETRUCHIO,"And wherefore gaze this goodly company,"
90099,90100,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,3.2.94,PETRUCHIO,"As if they saw some wondrous monument,"
90100,90101,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,3.2.95,PETRUCHIO,Some comet or unusual prodigy?
90101,90102,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,3.2.96,BAPTISTA,"Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:"
90102,90103,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,3.2.97,BAPTISTA,"First were we sad, fearing you would not come,"
90103,90104,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,3.2.98,BAPTISTA,"Now sadder, that you come so unprovided."
90104,90105,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,3.2.99,BAPTISTA,"Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,"
90105,90106,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,3.2.100,BAPTISTA,An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
90106,90107,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,3.2.101,TRANIO,"And tells us, what occasion of import"
90107,90108,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,3.2.102,TRANIO,"Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,"
90108,90109,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,3.2.103,TRANIO,And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
90109,90110,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,3.2.104,PETRUCHIO,"Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:"
90110,90111,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,3.2.105,PETRUCHIO,"Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,"
90111,90112,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,3.2.106,PETRUCHIO,"Though in some part enforced to digress,"
90112,90113,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,3.2.107,PETRUCHIO,"Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse"
90113,90114,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,3.2.108,PETRUCHIO,As you shall well be satisfied withal.
90114,90115,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,3.2.109,PETRUCHIO,But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
90115,90116,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,3.2.110,PETRUCHIO,"The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church."
90116,90117,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,3.2.111,TRANIO,See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
90117,90118,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,3.2.112,TRANIO,"Go to my chamber, Put on clothes of mine."
90118,90119,Taming of the Shrew,38.0,3.2.113,PETRUCHIO,"Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her."
90119,90120,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,3.2.114,BAPTISTA,"But thus, I trust, you will not marry her."
90120,90121,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.115,PETRUCHIO,"Good sooth, even thus, therefore ha' done with words:"
90121,90122,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.116,PETRUCHIO,"To me she's married, not unto my clothes:"
90122,90123,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.117,PETRUCHIO,"Could I repair what she will wear in me,"
90123,90124,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.118,PETRUCHIO,"As I can change these poor accoutrements,"
90124,90125,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.119,PETRUCHIO,'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
90125,90126,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.120,PETRUCHIO,"But what a fool am I to chat with you,"
90126,90127,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.121,PETRUCHIO,"When I should bid good morrow to my bride,"
90127,90128,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,3.2.122,PETRUCHIO,And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
90128,90129,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,,PETRUCHIO,Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
90129,90130,Taming of the Shrew,41.0,3.2.123,TRANIO,He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
90130,90131,Taming of the Shrew,41.0,3.2.124,TRANIO,"We will persuade him, be it possible,"
90131,90132,Taming of the Shrew,41.0,3.2.125,TRANIO,To put on better ere he go to church.
90132,90133,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,3.2.126,BAPTISTA,"I'll after him, and see the event of this."
90133,90134,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,,BAPTISTA,"Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants"
90134,90135,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.127,TRANIO,But to her love concerneth us to add
90135,90136,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.128,TRANIO,"Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,"
90136,90137,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.129,TRANIO,"As I before unparted to your worship,"
90137,90138,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.130,TRANIO,"I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,"
90138,90139,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.131,TRANIO,"It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--"
90139,90140,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.132,TRANIO,"And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,"
90140,90141,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.133,TRANIO,And make assurance here in Padua
90141,90142,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.134,TRANIO,Of greater sums than I have promised.
90142,90143,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.135,TRANIO,"So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,"
90143,90144,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,3.2.136,TRANIO,And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
90144,90145,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,3.2.137,LUCENTIO,Were it not that my fellow-school-master
90145,90146,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,3.2.138,LUCENTIO,"Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,"
90146,90147,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,3.2.139,LUCENTIO,"'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage,"
90147,90148,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,3.2.140,LUCENTIO,"Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,"
90148,90149,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,3.2.141,LUCENTIO,"I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world."
90149,90150,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,3.2.142,TRANIO,"That by degrees we mean to look into,"
90150,90151,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,3.2.143,TRANIO,And watch our vantage in this business:
90151,90152,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,3.2.144,TRANIO,"We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,"
90152,90153,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,3.2.145,TRANIO,"The narrow-prying father, Minola,"
90153,90154,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,3.2.146,TRANIO,"The quaint musician, amorous Licio,"
90154,90155,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,3.2.147,TRANIO,"All for my master's sake, Lucentio."
90155,90156,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,,TRANIO,Re-enter GREMIO
90156,90157,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,3.2.148,TRANIO,"Signior Gremio, came you from the church?"
90157,90158,Taming of the Shrew,46.0,3.2.149,GREMIO,As willingly as e'er I came from school.
90158,90159,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,3.2.150,TRANIO,And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
90159,90160,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,3.2.151,GREMIO,"A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,"
90160,90161,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,3.2.152,GREMIO,"A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find."
90161,90162,Taming of the Shrew,49.0,3.2.153,TRANIO,"Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible."
90162,90163,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,3.2.154,GREMIO,"Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend."
90163,90164,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,3.2.155,TRANIO,"Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam."
90164,90165,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.156,GREMIO,"Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!"
90165,90166,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.157,GREMIO,"I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest"
90166,90167,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.158,GREMIO,"Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,"
90167,90168,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.159,GREMIO,"'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he, and swore so loud,"
90168,90169,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.160,GREMIO,"That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book,"
90169,90170,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.161,GREMIO,"And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,"
90170,90171,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.162,GREMIO,The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
90171,90172,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.163,GREMIO,That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
90172,90173,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,3.2.164,GREMIO,"'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'"
90173,90174,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,3.2.165,TRANIO,What said the wench when he rose again?
90174,90175,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.166,GREMIO,"Trembled and shook, for why, he stamp'd and swore,"
90175,90176,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.167,GREMIO,As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
90176,90177,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.168,GREMIO,"But after many ceremonies done,"
90177,90178,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.169,GREMIO,"He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if"
90178,90179,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.170,GREMIO,"He had been aboard, carousing to his mates"
90179,90180,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.171,GREMIO,"After a storm, quaff'd off the muscadel"
90180,90181,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.172,GREMIO,"And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,"
90181,90182,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.173,GREMIO,Having no other reason
90182,90183,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.174,GREMIO,But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
90183,90184,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.175,GREMIO,And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
90184,90185,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.176,GREMIO,"This done, he took the bride about the neck"
90185,90186,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.177,GREMIO,And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
90186,90187,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.178,GREMIO,That at the parting all the church did echo:
90187,90188,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.179,GREMIO,"And I seeing this came thence for very shame,"
90188,90189,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.180,GREMIO,"And after me, I know, the rout is coming."
90189,90190,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.181,GREMIO,Such a mad marriage never was before:
90190,90191,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,3.2.182,GREMIO,"Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play."
90191,90192,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,,GREMIO,Music
90192,90193,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,,GREMIO,"Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and Train"
90193,90194,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,3.2.183,PETRUCHIO,"Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:"
90194,90195,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,3.2.184,PETRUCHIO,"I know you think to dine with me to-day,"
90195,90196,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,3.2.185,PETRUCHIO,"And have prepared great store of wedding cheer,"
90196,90197,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,3.2.186,PETRUCHIO,"But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,"
90197,90198,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,3.2.187,PETRUCHIO,And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
90198,90199,Taming of the Shrew,56.0,3.2.188,BAPTISTA,Is't possible you will away to-night?
90199,90200,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.189,PETRUCHIO,"I must away to-day, before night come:"
90200,90201,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.190,PETRUCHIO,"Make it no wonder, if you knew my business,"
90201,90202,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.191,PETRUCHIO,You would entreat me rather go than stay.
90202,90203,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.192,PETRUCHIO,"And, honest company, I thank you all,"
90203,90204,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.193,PETRUCHIO,That have beheld me give away myself
90204,90205,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.194,PETRUCHIO,"To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:"
90205,90206,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.195,PETRUCHIO,"Dine with my father, drink a health to me,"
90206,90207,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,3.2.196,PETRUCHIO,"For I must hence, and farewell to you all."
90207,90208,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,3.2.197,TRANIO,Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
90208,90209,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,3.2.198,PETRUCHIO,It may not be.
90209,90210,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,3.2.199,GREMIO,Let me entreat you.
90210,90211,Taming of the Shrew,61.0,3.2.200,PETRUCHIO,It cannot be.
90211,90212,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,3.2.201,KATHARINA,Let me entreat you.
90212,90213,Taming of the Shrew,63.0,3.2.202,PETRUCHIO,I am content.
90213,90214,Taming of the Shrew,64.0,3.2.203,KATHARINA,Are you content to stay?
90214,90215,Taming of the Shrew,65.0,3.2.204,PETRUCHIO,"I am content you shall entreat me stay,"
90215,90216,Taming of the Shrew,65.0,3.2.205,PETRUCHIO,"But yet not stay, entreat me how you can."
90216,90217,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,3.2.206,KATHARINA,"Now, if you love me, stay."
90217,90218,Taming of the Shrew,67.0,3.2.207,PETRUCHIO,"Grumio, my horse."
90218,90219,Taming of the Shrew,68.0,3.2.208,GRUMIO,"Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses."
90219,90220,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.209,KATHARINA,"Nay, then,"
90220,90221,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.210,KATHARINA,"Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day,"
90221,90222,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.211,KATHARINA,"No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself."
90222,90223,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.212,KATHARINA,"The door is open, sir, there lies your way,"
90223,90224,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.213,KATHARINA,"You may be jogging whiles your boots are green,"
90224,90225,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.214,KATHARINA,"For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:"
90225,90226,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.215,KATHARINA,"'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,"
90226,90227,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,3.2.216,KATHARINA,That take it on you at the first so roundly.
90227,90228,Taming of the Shrew,70.0,3.2.217,PETRUCHIO,"O Kate, content thee, prithee, be not angry."
90228,90229,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,3.2.218,KATHARINA,I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
90229,90230,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,3.2.219,KATHARINA,"Father, be quiet, he shall stay my leisure."
90230,90231,Taming of the Shrew,72.0,3.2.220,GREMIO,"Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work."
90231,90232,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,3.2.221,KATARINA,"Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:"
90232,90233,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,3.2.222,KATARINA,"I see a woman may be made a fool,"
90233,90234,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,3.2.223,KATARINA,If she had not a spirit to resist.
90234,90235,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,3.2.224,PETRUCHIO,"They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command."
90235,90236,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,3.2.225,PETRUCHIO,"Obey the bride, you that attend on her,"
90236,90237,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,3.2.226,PETRUCHIO,"Go to the feast, revel and domineer,"

90336,90337,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.63,GRUMIO,"Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,"

90340,90341,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.67,GRUMIO,"with the horse upon her, how he beat me because"
90341,90342,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.68,GRUMIO,"her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt"
90342,90343,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.69,GRUMIO,"to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,"
90343,90344,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.70,GRUMIO,"that never prayed before, how I cried, how the"
90344,90345,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.71,GRUMIO,"horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I"
90345,90346,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.72,GRUMIO,"lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,"
90346,90347,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.73,GRUMIO,which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
90347,90348,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.1.74,GRUMIO,unexperienced to thy grave.
90348,90349,Taming of the Shrew,30.0,4.1.75,CURTIS,By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
90349,90350,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,4.1.76,GRUMIO,"Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall"
90350,90351,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,4.1.77,GRUMIO,find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?

90444,90445,Taming of the Shrew,61.0,4.1.161,PETRUCHIO,"For it engenders choler, planteth anger,"
90445,90446,Taming of the Shrew,61.0,4.1.162,PETRUCHIO,"And better 'twere that both of us did fast,"

90466,90467,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.178,PETRUCHIO,"My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,"
90467,90468,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.179,PETRUCHIO,"And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,"
90468,90469,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.180,PETRUCHIO,For then she never looks upon her lure.
90469,90470,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.181,PETRUCHIO,"Another way I have to man my haggard,"
90470,90471,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.182,PETRUCHIO,"To make her come and know her keeper's call,"
90471,90472,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.183,PETRUCHIO,"That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites"
90472,90473,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.184,PETRUCHIO,That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
90473,90474,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.185,PETRUCHIO,"She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat,"
90474,90475,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.186,PETRUCHIO,"Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not,"
90475,90476,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.187,PETRUCHIO,"As with the meat, some undeserved fault"
90476,90477,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.188,PETRUCHIO,"I'll find about the making of the bed,"
90477,90478,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.189,PETRUCHIO,"And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,"
90478,90479,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.190,PETRUCHIO,"This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:"
90479,90480,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.191,PETRUCHIO,"Ay, and amid this hurly I intend"
90480,90481,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.192,PETRUCHIO,"That all is done in reverend care of her,"
90481,90482,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.193,PETRUCHIO,And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
90482,90483,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.194,PETRUCHIO,And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
90483,90484,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.195,PETRUCHIO,And with the clamour keep her still awake.
90484,90485,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.196,PETRUCHIO,"This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,"
90485,90486,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.197,PETRUCHIO,And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
90486,90487,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.198,PETRUCHIO,"He that knows better how to tame a shrew,"
90487,90488,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,4.1.199,PETRUCHIO,Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

90505,90506,Taming of the Shrew,9.0,4.2.14,TRANIO,O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
90506,90507,Taming of the Shrew,9.0,4.2.15,TRANIO,"I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful."

90511,90512,Taming of the Shrew,10.0,4.2.20,HORTENSIO,And makes a god of such a cullion:

90513,90514,Taming of the Shrew,11.0,4.2.22,TRANIO,"Signior Hortensio, I have often heard"

90522,90523,Taming of the Shrew,12.0,4.2.31,HORTENSIO,That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
90523,90524,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,4.2.32,TRANIO,"And here I take the unfeigned oath,"
90524,90525,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,4.2.33,TRANIO,Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
90525,90526,Taming of the Shrew,13.0,4.2.34,TRANIO,"Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!"
90526,90527,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.35,HORTENSIO,Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
90527,90528,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.36,HORTENSIO,"For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,"
90528,90529,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.37,HORTENSIO,"I will be married to a wealthy widow,"
90529,90530,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.38,HORTENSIO,"Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me"
90530,90531,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.39,HORTENSIO,As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
90531,90532,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.40,HORTENSIO,"And so farewell, Signior Lucentio."
90532,90533,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.41,HORTENSIO,"Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,"
90533,90534,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.42,HORTENSIO,"Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,"
90534,90535,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,4.2.43,HORTENSIO,In resolution as I swore before.
90535,90536,Taming of the Shrew,14.0,,HORTENSIO,Exit

90539,90540,Taming of the Shrew,15.0,4.2.47,TRANIO,And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

90551,90552,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,4.2.59,TRANIO,"That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,"
90552,90553,Taming of the Shrew,25.0,4.2.60,TRANIO,To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

90559,90560,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,4.2.66,BIONDELLO,"Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,"
90560,90561,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,4.2.67,BIONDELLO,"I know not what, but format in apparel,"
90561,90562,Taming of the Shrew,28.0,4.2.68,BIONDELLO,In gait and countenance surely like a father.
90562,90563,Taming of the Shrew,29.0,4.2.69,LUCENTIO,"And what of him, Tranio?"
90563,90564,Taming of the Shrew,30.0,4.2.70,TRANIO,"If he be credulous and trust my tale,"

90753,90754,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,4.3.124,Tailor,But how did you desire it should be made?

91232,91233,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,5.2.46,PETRUCHIO,"Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,"
91233,91234,Taming of the Shrew,31.0,5.2.47,PETRUCHIO,Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
91234,91235,Taming of the Shrew,32.0,5.2.48,BIANCA,"Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,"
91235,91236,Taming of the Shrew,32.0,5.2.49,BIANCA,And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
91236,91237,Taming of the Shrew,32.0,5.2.50,BIANCA,You are welcome all.
91237,91238,Taming of the Shrew,32.0,,BIANCA,"Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow"
91238,91239,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,5.2.51,PETRUCHIO,"She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio."
91239,91240,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,5.2.52,PETRUCHIO,"This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not,"
91240,91241,Taming of the Shrew,33.0,5.2.53,PETRUCHIO,Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
91241,91242,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,5.2.54,TRANIO,"O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,"
91242,91243,Taming of the Shrew,34.0,5.2.55,TRANIO,Which runs himself and catches for his master.
91243,91244,Taming of the Shrew,35.0,5.2.56,PETRUCHIO,"A good swift simile, but something currish."
91244,91245,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,5.2.57,TRANIO,"'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:"
91245,91246,Taming of the Shrew,36.0,5.2.58,TRANIO,'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
91246,91247,Taming of the Shrew,37.0,5.2.59,BAPTISTA,"O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now."
91247,91248,Taming of the Shrew,38.0,5.2.60,LUCENTIO,"I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio."
91248,91249,Taming of the Shrew,39.0,5.2.61,HORTENSIO,"Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?"
91249,91250,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,5.2.62,PETRUCHIO,"A' has a little gall'd me, I confess,"
91250,91251,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,5.2.63,PETRUCHIO,"And, as the jest did glance away from me,"
91251,91252,Taming of the Shrew,40.0,5.2.64,PETRUCHIO,'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
91252,91253,Taming of the Shrew,41.0,5.2.65,BAPTISTA,"Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,"
91253,91254,Taming of the Shrew,41.0,5.2.66,BAPTISTA,I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
91254,91255,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,5.2.67,PETRUCHIO,"Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance"
91255,91256,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,5.2.68,PETRUCHIO,"Let's each one send unto his wife,"
91256,91257,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,5.2.69,PETRUCHIO,And he whose wife is most obedient
91257,91258,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,5.2.70,PETRUCHIO,"To come at first when he doth send for her,"
91258,91259,Taming of the Shrew,42.0,5.2.71,PETRUCHIO,Shall win the wager which we will propose.
91259,91260,Taming of the Shrew,43.0,5.2.72,HORTENSIO,Content. What is the wager?
91260,91261,Taming of the Shrew,44.0,5.2.73,LUCENTIO,Twenty crowns.
91261,91262,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,5.2.74,PETRUCHIO,Twenty crowns!
91262,91263,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,5.2.75,PETRUCHIO,"I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,"
91263,91264,Taming of the Shrew,45.0,5.2.76,PETRUCHIO,But twenty times so much upon my wife.
91264,91265,Taming of the Shrew,46.0,5.2.77,LUCENTIO,A hundred then.
91265,91266,Taming of the Shrew,47.0,5.2.78,HORTENSIO,Content.
91266,91267,Taming of the Shrew,48.0,5.2.79,PETRUCHIO,A match! 'tis done.
91267,91268,Taming of the Shrew,49.0,5.2.80,HORTENSIO,Who shall begin?
91268,91269,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,5.2.81,LUCENTIO,That will I.
91269,91270,Taming of the Shrew,50.0,5.2.82,LUCENTIO,"Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me."
91270,91271,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,5.2.83,BIONDELLO,I go.
91271,91272,Taming of the Shrew,51.0,,BIONDELLO,Exit
91272,91273,Taming of the Shrew,52.0,5.2.84,BAPTISTA,"Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes."
91273,91274,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,5.2.85,LUCENTIO,"I'll have no halves, I'll bear it all myself."
91274,91275,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,,LUCENTIO,Re-enter BIONDELLO
91275,91276,Taming of the Shrew,53.0,5.2.86,LUCENTIO,How now! what news?
91276,91277,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,5.2.87,BIONDELLO,"Sir, my mistress sends you word"
91277,91278,Taming of the Shrew,54.0,5.2.88,BIONDELLO,That she is busy and she cannot come.
91278,91279,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,5.2.89,PETRUCHIO,How! she is busy and she cannot come!
91279,91280,Taming of the Shrew,55.0,5.2.90,PETRUCHIO,Is that an answer?
91280,91281,Taming of the Shrew,56.0,5.2.91,GREMIO,"Ay, and a kind one too:"
91281,91282,Taming of the Shrew,56.0,5.2.92,GREMIO,"Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse."
91282,91283,Taming of the Shrew,57.0,5.2.93,PETRUCHIO,I hope better.
91283,91284,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,5.2.94,HORTENSIO,"Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife"
91284,91285,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,5.2.95,HORTENSIO,To come to me forthwith.
91285,91286,Taming of the Shrew,58.0,,HORTENSIO,Exit BIONDELLO
91286,91287,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,5.2.96,PETRUCHIO,"O, ho! entreat her!"
91287,91288,Taming of the Shrew,59.0,5.2.97,PETRUCHIO,"Nay, then she must needs come."
91288,91289,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,5.2.98,HORTENSIO,"I am afraid, sir,"
91289,91290,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,5.2.99,HORTENSIO,"Do what you can, yours will not be entreated."
91290,91291,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,,HORTENSIO,Re-enter BIONDELLO
91291,91292,Taming of the Shrew,60.0,5.2.100,HORTENSIO,"Now, where's my wife?"
91292,91293,Taming of the Shrew,61.0,5.2.101,BIONDELLO,She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
91293,91294,Taming of the Shrew,61.0,5.2.102,BIONDELLO,She will not come: she bids you come to her.
91294,91295,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,5.2.103,PETRUCHIO,"Worse and worse, she will not come! O vile,"
91295,91296,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,5.2.104,PETRUCHIO,"Intolerable, not to be endured!"
91296,91297,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,5.2.105,PETRUCHIO,"Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,"
91297,91298,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,5.2.106,PETRUCHIO,"Say, I command her to come to me."
91298,91299,Taming of the Shrew,62.0,,PETRUCHIO,Exit GRUMIO
91299,91300,Taming of the Shrew,63.0,5.2.107,HORTENSIO,I know her answer.
91300,91301,Taming of the Shrew,64.0,5.2.108,PETRUCHIO,What?
91301,91302,Taming of the Shrew,65.0,5.2.109,HORTENSIO,She will not.
91302,91303,Taming of the Shrew,66.0,5.2.110,PETRUCHIO,"The fouler fortune mine, and there an end."
91303,91304,Taming of the Shrew,67.0,5.2.111,BAPTISTA,"Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!"
91304,91305,Taming of the Shrew,67.0,,BAPTISTA,Re-enter KATARINA
91305,91306,Taming of the Shrew,68.0,5.2.112,KATHARINA,"What is your will, sir, that you send for me?"
91306,91307,Taming of the Shrew,69.0,5.2.113,PETRUCHIO,"Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?"
91307,91308,Taming of the Shrew,70.0,5.2.114,KATHARINA,They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
91308,91309,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,5.2.115,PETRUCHIO,Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
91309,91310,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,5.2.116,PETRUCHIO,Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
91310,91311,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,5.2.117,PETRUCHIO,"Away, I say, and bring them hither straight."
91311,91312,Taming of the Shrew,71.0,,PETRUCHIO,Exit KATHARINA
91312,91313,Taming of the Shrew,72.0,5.2.118,LUCENTIO,"Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder."
91313,91314,Taming of the Shrew,73.0,5.2.119,HORTENSIO,And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
91314,91315,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,5.2.120,PETRUCHIO,"Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,"
91315,91316,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,5.2.121,PETRUCHIO,"And awful rule and right supremacy,"
91316,91317,Taming of the Shrew,74.0,5.2.122,PETRUCHIO,"And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?"
91317,91318,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,5.2.123,BAPTISTA,"Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!"
91318,91319,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,5.2.124,BAPTISTA,"The wager thou hast won, and I will add"
91319,91320,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,5.2.125,BAPTISTA,"Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,"
91320,91321,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,5.2.126,BAPTISTA,"Another dowry to another daughter,"
91321,91322,Taming of the Shrew,75.0,5.2.127,BAPTISTA,"For she is changed, as she had never been."
91322,91323,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,5.2.128,PETRUCHIO,"Nay, I will win my wager better yet"
91323,91324,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,5.2.129,PETRUCHIO,"And show more sign of her obedience,"
91324,91325,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,5.2.130,PETRUCHIO,Her new-built virtue and obedience.
91325,91326,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,5.2.131,PETRUCHIO,See where she comes and brings your froward wives
91326,91327,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,5.2.132,PETRUCHIO,As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
91327,91328,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,,PETRUCHIO,"Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow"
91328,91329,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,5.2.133,PETRUCHIO,"Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:"
91329,91330,Taming of the Shrew,76.0,5.2.134,PETRUCHIO,"Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot."
91330,91331,Taming of the Shrew,77.0,5.2.135,Widow,"Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,"
91331,91332,Taming of the Shrew,77.0,5.2.136,Widow,Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
91332,91333,Taming of the Shrew,78.0,5.2.137,BIANCA,Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
91333,91334,Taming of the Shrew,79.0,5.2.138,LUCENTIO,I would your duty were as foolish too:
91334,91335,Taming of the Shrew,79.0,5.2.139,LUCENTIO,"The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,"
91335,91336,Taming of the Shrew,79.0,5.2.140,LUCENTIO,Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
91336,91337,Taming of the Shrew,80.0,5.2.141,BIANCA,"The more fool you, for laying on my duty."
91337,91338,Taming of the Shrew,81.0,5.2.142,PETRUCHIO,"Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women"
91338,91339,Taming of the Shrew,81.0,5.2.143,PETRUCHIO,What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
91339,91340,Taming of the Shrew,82.0,5.2.144,Widow,"Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling."
91340,91341,Taming of the Shrew,83.0,5.2.145,PETRUCHIO,"Come on, I say, and first begin with her."
91341,91342,Taming of the Shrew,84.0,5.2.146,Widow,She shall not.
91342,91343,Taming of the Shrew,85.0,5.2.147,PETRUCHIO,I say she shall: and first begin with her.
91343,91344,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.148,KATHARINA,"Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,"
91344,91345,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.149,KATHARINA,"And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,"
91345,91346,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.150,KATHARINA,"To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:"
91346,91347,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.151,KATHARINA,"It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,"
91347,91348,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.152,KATHARINA,"Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,"
91348,91349,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.153,KATHARINA,And in no sense is meet or amiable.
91349,91350,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.154,KATHARINA,"A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,"
91350,91351,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.155,KATHARINA,"Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,"
91351,91352,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.156,KATHARINA,"And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty"
91352,91353,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.157,KATHARINA,Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
91353,91354,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.158,KATHARINA,"Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,"
91354,91355,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.159,KATHARINA,"Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,"
91355,91356,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.160,KATHARINA,And for thy maintenance commits his body
91356,91357,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.161,KATHARINA,"To painful labour both by sea and land,"
91357,91358,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.162,KATHARINA,"To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,"
91358,91359,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.163,KATHARINA,"Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,"
91359,91360,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.164,KATHARINA,And craves no other tribute at thy hands
91360,91361,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.165,KATHARINA,"But love, fair looks and true obedience,"
91361,91362,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.166,KATHARINA,Too little payment for so great a debt.
91362,91363,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.167,KATHARINA,Such duty as the subject owes the prince
91363,91364,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.168,KATHARINA,"Even such a woman oweth to her husband,"
91364,91365,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.169,KATHARINA,"And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,"
91365,91366,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.170,KATHARINA,"And not obedient to his honest will,"
91366,91367,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.171,KATHARINA,What is she but a foul contending rebel
91367,91368,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.172,KATHARINA,And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
91368,91369,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.173,KATHARINA,I am ashamed that women are so simple
91369,91370,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.174,KATHARINA,"To offer war where they should kneel for peace,"
91370,91371,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.175,KATHARINA,"Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,"
91371,91372,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.176,KATHARINA,"When they are bound to serve, love and obey."
91372,91373,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.177,KATHARINA,"Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,"
91373,91374,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.178,KATHARINA,"Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,"
91374,91375,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.179,KATHARINA,But that our soft conditions and our hearts
91375,91376,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.180,KATHARINA,Should well agree with our external parts?
91376,91377,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.181,KATHARINA,"Come, come, you froward and unable worms!"
91377,91378,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.182,KATHARINA,"My mind hath been as big as one of yours,"
91378,91379,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.183,KATHARINA,"My heart as great, my reason haply more,"
91379,91380,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.184,KATHARINA,"To bandy word for word and frown for frown,"
91380,91381,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.185,KATHARINA,"But now I see our lances are but straws,"
91381,91382,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.186,KATHARINA,"Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,"
91382,91383,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.187,KATHARINA,That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
91383,91384,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.188,KATHARINA,"Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,"
91384,91385,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.189,KATHARINA,And place your hands below your husband's foot:
91385,91386,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.190,KATHARINA,"In token of which duty, if he please,"
91386,91387,Taming of the Shrew,86.0,5.2.191,KATHARINA,"My hand is ready, may it do him ease."
91387,91388,Taming of the Shrew,87.0,5.2.192,PETRUCHIO,"Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate."
91388,91389,Taming of the Shrew,88.0,5.2.193,LUCENTIO,"Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't."
91389,91390,Taming of the Shrew,89.0,5.2.194,VINCENTIO,'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
91390,91391,Taming of the Shrew,90.0,5.2.195,LUCENTIO,But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
91391,91392,Taming of the Shrew,91.0,5.2.196,PETRUCHIO,"Come, Kate, we'll to bed."
91392,91393,Taming of the Shrew,91.0,5.2.197,PETRUCHIO,"We three are married, but you two are sped."

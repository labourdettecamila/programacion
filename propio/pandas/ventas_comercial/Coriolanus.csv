24484,24485,Coriolanus,141.0,,DROMIO OF EPHESUS,"Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons"
24485,24486,Coriolanus,1.0,1.1.1,First Citizen,"Before we proceed any further, hear me speak."
24486,24487,Coriolanus,2.0,1.1.2,All,"Speak, speak."
24487,24488,Coriolanus,3.0,1.1.3,First Citizen,You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
24488,24489,Coriolanus,4.0,1.1.4,All,Resolved. resolved.
24489,24490,Coriolanus,5.0,1.1.5,First Citizen,"First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people."
24490,24491,Coriolanus,6.0,1.1.6,All,"We know't, we know't."
24491,24492,Coriolanus,7.0,1.1.7,First Citizen,"Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price."
24492,24493,Coriolanus,7.0,1.1.8,First Citizen,Is't a verdict?
24493,24494,Coriolanus,8.0,1.1.9,All,"No more talking on't, let it be done: away, away!"
24494,24495,Coriolanus,9.0,1.1.10,Second Citizen,"One word, good citizens."
24495,24496,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.11,First Citizen,"We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good."
24496,24497,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.12,First Citizen,What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
24497,24498,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.13,First Citizen,"would yield us but the superfluity, while it were"
24498,24499,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.14,First Citizen,"wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely,"
24499,24500,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.15,First Citizen,but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
24500,24501,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.16,First Citizen,"afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an"
24501,24502,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.17,First Citizen,"inventory to particularise their abundance, our"
24502,24503,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.18,First Citizen,sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with

24504,24505,Coriolanus,10.0,1.1.20,First Citizen,"speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge."
24505,24506,Coriolanus,11.0,1.1.21,Second Citizen,Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
24506,24507,Coriolanus,12.0,1.1.22,All,Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
24507,24508,Coriolanus,13.0,1.1.23,Second Citizen,Consider you what services he has done for his country?
24508,24509,Coriolanus,14.0,1.1.24,First Citizen,"Very well, and could be content to give him good"
24509,24510,Coriolanus,14.0,1.1.25,First Citizen,"report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud."
24510,24511,Coriolanus,15.0,1.1.26,Second Citizen,"Nay, but speak not maliciously."
24511,24512,Coriolanus,16.0,1.1.27,First Citizen,"I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did"
24512,24513,Coriolanus,16.0,1.1.28,First Citizen,it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
24513,24514,Coriolanus,16.0,1.1.29,First Citizen,content to say it was for his country he did it to
24514,24515,Coriolanus,16.0,1.1.30,First Citizen,"please his mother and to be partly proud, which he"
24515,24516,Coriolanus,16.0,1.1.31,First Citizen,"is, even till the altitude of his virtue."
24516,24517,Coriolanus,17.0,1.1.32,Second Citizen,"What he cannot help in his nature, you account a"
24517,24518,Coriolanus,17.0,1.1.33,Second Citizen,vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
24518,24519,Coriolanus,18.0,1.1.34,First Citizen,"If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations,"
24519,24520,Coriolanus,18.0,1.1.35,First Citizen,"he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition."
24520,24521,Coriolanus,18.0,,First Citizen,Shouts within
24521,24522,Coriolanus,18.0,1.1.36,First Citizen,What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
24522,24523,Coriolanus,18.0,1.1.37,First Citizen,is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
24523,24524,Coriolanus,19.0,1.1.38,All,"Come, come."
24524,24525,Coriolanus,20.0,1.1.39,First Citizen,Soft! who comes here?
24525,24526,Coriolanus,20.0,,First Citizen,Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
24526,24527,Coriolanus,21.0,1.1.40,Second Citizen,"Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always loved"
24527,24528,Coriolanus,21.0,1.1.41,Second Citizen,the people.
24528,24529,Coriolanus,22.0,1.1.42,First Citizen,He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
24529,24530,Coriolanus,23.0,1.1.43,MENENIUS,"What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you"
24530,24531,Coriolanus,23.0,1.1.44,MENENIUS,"With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you."
24531,24532,Coriolanus,24.0,1.1.45,First Citizen,"Our business is not unknown to the senate, they have"
24532,24533,Coriolanus,24.0,1.1.46,First Citizen,"had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,"
24533,24534,Coriolanus,24.0,1.1.47,First Citizen,which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
24534,24535,Coriolanus,24.0,1.1.48,First Citizen,suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
24535,24536,Coriolanus,24.0,1.1.49,First Citizen,have strong arms too.
24536,24537,Coriolanus,25.0,1.1.50,MENENIUS,"Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,"
24537,24538,Coriolanus,25.0,1.1.51,MENENIUS,Will you undo yourselves?
24538,24539,Coriolanus,26.0,1.1.52,First Citizen,"We cannot, sir, we are undone already."
24539,24540,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.53,MENENIUS,"I tell you, friends, most charitable care"
24540,24541,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.54,MENENIUS,"Have the patricians of you. For your wants,"
24541,24542,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.55,MENENIUS,"Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well"
24542,24543,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.56,MENENIUS,Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
24543,24544,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.57,MENENIUS,"Against the Roman state, whose course will on"
24544,24545,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.58,MENENIUS,"The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs"
24545,24546,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.59,MENENIUS,Of more strong link asunder than can ever
24546,24547,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.60,MENENIUS,"Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,"
24547,24548,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.61,MENENIUS,"The gods, not the patricians, make it, and"
24548,24549,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.62,MENENIUS,"Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,"
24549,24550,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.63,MENENIUS,You are transported by calamity
24550,24551,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.64,MENENIUS,"Thither where more attends you, and you slander"
24551,24552,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.65,MENENIUS,"The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,"
24552,24553,Coriolanus,27.0,1.1.66,MENENIUS,When you curse them as enemies.
24553,24554,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.67,First Citizen,"Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us"
24554,24555,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.68,First Citizen,"yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses"
24555,24556,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.69,First Citizen,"crammed with grain, make edicts for usury, to"
24556,24557,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.70,First Citizen,"support usurers, repeal daily any wholesome act"
24557,24558,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.71,First Citizen,"established against the rich, and provide more"
24558,24559,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.72,First Citizen,"piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain"
24559,24560,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.73,First Citizen,"the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will, and"
24560,24561,Coriolanus,28.0,1.1.74,First Citizen,there's all the love they bear us.
24561,24562,Coriolanus,29.0,1.1.75,MENENIUS,Either you must
24562,24563,Coriolanus,29.0,1.1.76,MENENIUS,"Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,"
24563,24564,Coriolanus,29.0,1.1.77,MENENIUS,Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
24564,24565,Coriolanus,29.0,1.1.78,MENENIUS,"A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it,"
24565,24566,Coriolanus,29.0,1.1.79,MENENIUS,"But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture"
24566,24567,Coriolanus,29.0,1.1.80,MENENIUS,To stale 't a little more.
24567,24568,Coriolanus,30.0,1.1.81,First Citizen,"Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to"
24568,24569,Coriolanus,30.0,1.1.82,First Citizen,"fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please"
24569,24570,Coriolanus,30.0,1.1.83,First Citizen,"you, deliver."
24570,24571,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.84,MENENIUS,There was a time when all the body's members
24571,24572,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.85,MENENIUS,"Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:"
24572,24573,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.86,MENENIUS,That only like a gulf it did remain
24573,24574,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.87,MENENIUS,"I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,"
24574,24575,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.88,MENENIUS,"Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing"
24575,24576,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.89,MENENIUS,"Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments"
24576,24577,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.90,MENENIUS,"Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,"
24577,24578,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.91,MENENIUS,"And, mutually participate, did minister"
24578,24579,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.92,MENENIUS,Unto the appetite and affection common
24579,24580,Coriolanus,31.0,1.1.93,MENENIUS,Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
24580,24581,Coriolanus,32.0,1.1.94,First Citizen,"Well, sir, what answer made the belly?"
24581,24582,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.95,MENENIUS,"Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,"
24582,24583,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.96,MENENIUS,"Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--"
24583,24584,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.97,MENENIUS,"For, look you, I may make the belly smile"
24584,24585,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.98,MENENIUS,As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
24585,24586,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.99,MENENIUS,"To the discontented members, the mutinous parts"
24586,24587,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.100,MENENIUS,"That envied his receipt, even so most fitly"
24587,24588,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.101,MENENIUS,As you malign our senators for that
24588,24589,Coriolanus,33.0,1.1.102,MENENIUS,They are not such as you.
24589,24590,Coriolanus,34.0,1.1.103,First Citizen,Your belly's answer? What!
24590,24591,Coriolanus,34.0,1.1.104,First Citizen,"The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,"
24591,24592,Coriolanus,34.0,1.1.105,First Citizen,"The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,"
24592,24593,Coriolanus,34.0,1.1.106,First Citizen,"Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter."
24593,24594,Coriolanus,34.0,1.1.107,First Citizen,With other muniments and petty helps
24594,24595,Coriolanus,34.0,1.1.108,First Citizen,"In this our fabric, if that they--"
24595,24596,Coriolanus,35.0,1.1.109,MENENIUS,What then?
24596,24597,Coriolanus,35.0,1.1.110,MENENIUS,"'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?"
24597,24598,Coriolanus,36.0,1.1.111,First Citizen,"Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,"
24598,24599,Coriolanus,36.0,1.1.112,First Citizen,"Who is the sink o' the body,--"
24599,24600,Coriolanus,37.0,1.1.113,MENENIUS,"Well, what then?"
24600,24601,Coriolanus,38.0,1.1.114,First Citizen,"The former agents, if they did complain,"
24601,24602,Coriolanus,38.0,1.1.115,First Citizen,What could the belly answer?
24602,24603,Coriolanus,39.0,1.1.116,MENENIUS,I will tell you
24603,24604,Coriolanus,39.0,1.1.117,MENENIUS,If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
24604,24605,Coriolanus,39.0,1.1.118,MENENIUS,"Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer."
24605,24606,Coriolanus,40.0,1.1.119,First Citizen,Ye're long about it.
24606,24607,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.120,MENENIUS,"Note me this, good friend,"
24607,24608,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.121,MENENIUS,"Your most grave belly was deliberate,"
24608,24609,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.122,MENENIUS,"Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:"
24609,24610,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.123,MENENIUS,"'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,"
24610,24611,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.124,MENENIUS,"'That I receive the general food at first,"
24611,24612,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.125,MENENIUS,"Which you do live upon, and fit it is,"
24612,24613,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.126,MENENIUS,Because I am the store-house and the shop
24613,24614,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.127,MENENIUS,"Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,"
24614,24615,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.128,MENENIUS,"I send it through the rivers of your blood,"
24615,24616,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.129,MENENIUS,"Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain,"
24616,24617,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.130,MENENIUS,"And, through the cranks and offices of man,"
24617,24618,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.131,MENENIUS,The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
24618,24619,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.132,MENENIUS,From me receive that natural competency
24619,24620,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.133,MENENIUS,"Whereby they live: and though that all at once,"
24620,24621,Coriolanus,41.0,1.1.134,MENENIUS,"You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--"
24621,24622,Coriolanus,42.0,1.1.135,First Citizen,"Ay, sir, well, well."
24622,24623,Coriolanus,43.0,1.1.136,MENENIUS,'Though all at once cannot
24623,24624,Coriolanus,43.0,1.1.137,MENENIUS,"See what I do deliver out to each,"
24624,24625,Coriolanus,43.0,1.1.138,MENENIUS,"Yet I can make my audit up, that all"
24625,24626,Coriolanus,43.0,1.1.139,MENENIUS,"From me do back receive the flour of all,"
24626,24627,Coriolanus,43.0,1.1.140,MENENIUS,And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
24627,24628,Coriolanus,44.0,1.1.141,First Citizen,It was an answer: how apply you this?
24628,24629,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.142,MENENIUS,"The senators of Rome are this good belly,"
24629,24630,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.143,MENENIUS,"And you the mutinous members, for examine"
24630,24631,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.144,MENENIUS,"Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly"
24631,24632,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.145,MENENIUS,"Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find"
24632,24633,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.146,MENENIUS,No public benefit which you receive
24633,24634,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.147,MENENIUS,But it proceeds or comes from them to you
24634,24635,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.148,MENENIUS,"And no way from yourselves. What do you think,"
24635,24636,Coriolanus,45.0,1.1.149,MENENIUS,"You, the great toe of this assembly?"
24636,24637,Coriolanus,46.0,1.1.150,First Citizen,I the great toe! why the great toe?
24637,24638,Coriolanus,47.0,1.1.151,MENENIUS,"For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,"
24638,24639,Coriolanus,47.0,1.1.152,MENENIUS,"Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:"
24639,24640,Coriolanus,47.0,1.1.153,MENENIUS,"Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,"
24640,24641,Coriolanus,47.0,1.1.154,MENENIUS,Lead'st first to win some vantage.
24641,24642,Coriolanus,47.0,1.1.155,MENENIUS,But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
24642,24643,Coriolanus,47.0,1.1.156,MENENIUS,"Rome and her rats are at the point of battle,"
24643,24644,Coriolanus,47.0,1.1.157,MENENIUS,The one side must have bale.
24644,24645,Coriolanus,47.0,,MENENIUS,Enter CAIUS MARCIUS

24646,24647,Coriolanus,48.0,1.1.159,MARCIUS,"Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,"
24647,24648,Coriolanus,48.0,1.1.160,MARCIUS,"That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,"
24648,24649,Coriolanus,48.0,1.1.161,MARCIUS,Make yourselves scabs?
24649,24650,Coriolanus,49.0,1.1.162,First Citizen,We have ever your good word.
24650,24651,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.163,MARCIUS,He that will give good words to thee will flatter

24655,24656,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.168,MARCIUS,"Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,"
24656,24657,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.169,MARCIUS,"Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,"
24657,24658,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.170,MARCIUS,Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
24658,24659,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.171,MARCIUS,To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
24659,24660,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.172,MARCIUS,And curse that justice did it.
24660,24661,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.173,MARCIUS,Who deserves greatness
24661,24662,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.174,MARCIUS,"Deserves your hate, and your affections are"
24662,24663,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.175,MARCIUS,"A sick man's appetite, who desires most that"
24663,24664,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.176,MARCIUS,Which would increase his evil. He that depends
24664,24665,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.177,MARCIUS,Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
24665,24666,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.178,MARCIUS,And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
24666,24667,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.179,MARCIUS,"With every minute you do change a mind,"
24667,24668,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.180,MARCIUS,"And call him noble that was now your hate,"
24668,24669,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.181,MARCIUS,"Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,"
24669,24670,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.182,MARCIUS,That in these several places of the city
24670,24671,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.183,MARCIUS,"You cry against the noble senate, who,"
24671,24672,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.184,MARCIUS,"Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else"
24672,24673,Coriolanus,50.0,1.1.185,MARCIUS,Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
24673,24674,Coriolanus,51.0,1.1.186,MENENIUS,"For corn at their own rates, whereof, they say,"
24674,24675,Coriolanus,51.0,1.1.187,MENENIUS,The city is well stored.
24675,24676,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.188,MARCIUS,Hang 'em! They say!
24676,24677,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.189,MARCIUS,"They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know"
24677,24678,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.190,MARCIUS,"What's done i' the Capitol, who's like to rise,"
24678,24679,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.191,MARCIUS,"Who thrives and who declines, side factions"
24679,24680,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.192,MARCIUS,and give out
24680,24681,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.193,MARCIUS,"Conjectural marriages, making parties strong"
24681,24682,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.194,MARCIUS,And feebling such as stand not in their liking
24682,24683,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.195,MARCIUS,Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
24683,24684,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.196,MARCIUS,grain enough!
24684,24685,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.197,MARCIUS,"Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,"
24685,24686,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.198,MARCIUS,"And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry"
24686,24687,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.199,MARCIUS,"With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high"
24687,24688,Coriolanus,52.0,1.1.200,MARCIUS,As I could pick my lance.
24688,24689,Coriolanus,53.0,1.1.201,MENENIUS,"Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded,"
24689,24690,Coriolanus,53.0,1.1.202,MENENIUS,"For though abundantly they lack discretion,"
24690,24691,Coriolanus,53.0,1.1.203,MENENIUS,"Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,"
24691,24692,Coriolanus,53.0,1.1.204,MENENIUS,What says the other troop?
24692,24693,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.205,MARCIUS,They are dissolved: hang 'em!
24693,24694,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.206,MARCIUS,"They said they were an-hungry, sigh'd forth proverbs,"
24694,24695,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.207,MARCIUS,"That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,"
24695,24696,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.208,MARCIUS,"That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not"
24696,24697,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.209,MARCIUS,Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
24697,24698,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.210,MARCIUS,"They vented their complainings, which being answer'd,"
24698,24699,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.211,MARCIUS,"And a petition granted them, a strange one--"
24699,24700,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.212,MARCIUS,"To break the heart of generosity,"
24700,24701,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.213,MARCIUS,And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
24701,24702,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.214,MARCIUS,"As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,"
24702,24703,Coriolanus,54.0,1.1.215,MARCIUS,Shouting their emulation.
24703,24704,Coriolanus,55.0,1.1.216,MENENIUS,What is granted them?
24704,24705,Coriolanus,56.0,1.1.217,MARCIUS,"Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,"
24705,24706,Coriolanus,56.0,1.1.218,MARCIUS,"Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,"
24706,24707,Coriolanus,56.0,1.1.219,MARCIUS,"Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!"
24707,24708,Coriolanus,56.0,1.1.220,MARCIUS,"The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,"
24708,24709,Coriolanus,56.0,1.1.221,MARCIUS,Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
24709,24710,Coriolanus,56.0,1.1.222,MARCIUS,Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
24710,24711,Coriolanus,56.0,1.1.223,MARCIUS,For insurrection's arguing.
24711,24712,Coriolanus,57.0,1.1.224,MENENIUS,This is strange.
24712,24713,Coriolanus,58.0,1.1.225,MARCIUS,"Go, get you home, you fragments!"
24713,24714,Coriolanus,58.0,,MARCIUS,"Enter a Messenger, hastily"
24714,24715,Coriolanus,59.0,1.1.226,Messenger,Where's Caius Marcius?
24715,24716,Coriolanus,60.0,1.1.227,MARCIUS,Here: what's the matter?
24716,24717,Coriolanus,61.0,1.1.228,Messenger,"The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms."
24717,24718,Coriolanus,62.0,1.1.229,MARCIUS,I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
24718,24719,Coriolanus,62.0,1.1.230,MARCIUS,"Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders."
24719,24720,Coriolanus,62.0,1.1.230,MARCIUS,"Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators, JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS"
24720,24721,Coriolanus,63.0,1.1.231,First Senator,"Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us,"
24721,24722,Coriolanus,63.0,1.1.232,First Senator,The Volsces are in arms.
24722,24723,Coriolanus,64.0,1.1.233,MARCIUS,"They have a leader,"
24723,24724,Coriolanus,64.0,1.1.234,MARCIUS,"Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't."
24724,24725,Coriolanus,64.0,1.1.235,MARCIUS,"I sin in envying his nobility,"
24725,24726,Coriolanus,64.0,1.1.236,MARCIUS,"And were I any thing but what I am,"
24726,24727,Coriolanus,64.0,1.1.237,MARCIUS,I would wish me only he.
24727,24728,Coriolanus,65.0,1.1.238,COMINIUS,You have fought together.
24728,24729,Coriolanus,66.0,1.1.239,MARCIUS,Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
24729,24730,Coriolanus,66.0,1.1.240,MARCIUS,"Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make"
24730,24731,Coriolanus,66.0,1.1.241,MARCIUS,Only my wars with him: he is a lion
24731,24732,Coriolanus,66.0,1.1.242,MARCIUS,That I am proud to hunt.
24732,24733,Coriolanus,67.0,1.1.243,First Senator,"Then, worthy Marcius,"
24733,24734,Coriolanus,67.0,1.1.244,First Senator,Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
24734,24735,Coriolanus,68.0,1.1.245,COMINIUS,It is your former promise.
24735,24736,Coriolanus,69.0,1.1.246,MARCIUS,"Sir, it is,"
24736,24737,Coriolanus,69.0,1.1.247,MARCIUS,"And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou"
24737,24738,Coriolanus,69.0,1.1.248,MARCIUS,Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
24738,24739,Coriolanus,69.0,1.1.249,MARCIUS,"What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?"
24739,24740,Coriolanus,70.0,1.1.250,TITUS,"No, Caius Marcius,"
24740,24741,Coriolanus,70.0,1.1.251,TITUS,"I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,"
24741,24742,Coriolanus,70.0,1.1.252,TITUS,Ere stay behind this business.
24742,24743,Coriolanus,71.0,1.1.253,MENENIUS,"O, true-bred!"
24743,24744,Coriolanus,72.0,1.1.254,First Senator,"Your company to the Capitol, where, I know,"
24744,24745,Coriolanus,72.0,1.1.255,First Senator,Our greatest friends attend us.
24745,24746,Coriolanus,73.0,1.1.256,TITUS,[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.
24746,24747,Coriolanus,73.0,,TITUS,To MARCIUS
24747,24748,Coriolanus,73.0,1.1.257,TITUS,Right worthy you priority.
24748,24749,Coriolanus,74.0,1.1.258,COMINIUS,Noble Marcius!
24749,24750,Coriolanus,75.0,1.1.259,First Senator,"[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes, be gone!"
24750,24751,Coriolanus,76.0,1.1.260,MARCIUS,"Nay, let them follow:"
24751,24752,Coriolanus,76.0,1.1.261,MARCIUS,"The Volsces have much corn, take these rats thither"
24752,24753,Coriolanus,76.0,1.1.262,MARCIUS,"To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,"
24753,24754,Coriolanus,76.0,1.1.263,MARCIUS,"Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow."
24754,24755,Coriolanus,76.0,,MARCIUS,Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
24755,24756,Coriolanus,77.0,1.1.264,SICINIUS,Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
24756,24757,Coriolanus,78.0,1.1.265,BRUTUS,He has no equal.
24757,24758,Coriolanus,79.0,1.1.266,SICINIUS,"When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--"
24758,24759,Coriolanus,80.0,1.1.267,BRUTUS,Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
24759,24760,Coriolanus,81.0,1.1.268,SICINIUS,Nay. but his taunts.
24760,24761,Coriolanus,82.0,1.1.269,BRUTUS,"Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods."
24761,24762,Coriolanus,83.0,1.1.270,SICINIUS,Be-mock the modest moon.
24762,24763,Coriolanus,84.0,1.1.271,BRUTUS,The present wars devour him: he is grown
24763,24764,Coriolanus,84.0,1.1.272,BRUTUS,Too proud to be so valiant.
24764,24765,Coriolanus,85.0,1.1.273,SICINIUS,"Such a nature,"
24765,24766,Coriolanus,85.0,1.1.274,SICINIUS,"Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow"
24766,24767,Coriolanus,85.0,1.1.275,SICINIUS,Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
24767,24768,Coriolanus,85.0,1.1.276,SICINIUS,His insolence can brook to be commanded
24768,24769,Coriolanus,85.0,1.1.277,SICINIUS,Under Cominius.
24769,24770,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.278,BRUTUS,"Fame, at the which he aims,"
24770,24771,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.279,BRUTUS,"In whom already he's well graced, can not"
24771,24772,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.280,BRUTUS,Better be held nor more attain'd than by
24772,24773,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.281,BRUTUS,A place below the first: for what miscarries
24773,24774,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.282,BRUTUS,"Shall be the general's fault, though he perform"
24774,24775,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.283,BRUTUS,"To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure"
24775,24776,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.284,BRUTUS,Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
24776,24777,Coriolanus,86.0,1.1.285,BRUTUS,Had borne the business!'
24777,24778,Coriolanus,87.0,1.1.286,SICINIUS,"Besides, if things go well,"
24778,24779,Coriolanus,87.0,1.1.287,SICINIUS,Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
24779,24780,Coriolanus,87.0,1.1.288,SICINIUS,Of his demerits rob Cominius.
24780,24781,Coriolanus,88.0,1.1.289,BRUTUS,Come:
24781,24782,Coriolanus,88.0,1.1.290,BRUTUS,Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
24782,24783,Coriolanus,88.0,1.1.291,BRUTUS,"Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults"
24783,24784,Coriolanus,88.0,1.1.292,BRUTUS,"To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed"
24784,24785,Coriolanus,88.0,1.1.293,BRUTUS,In aught he merit not.
24785,24786,Coriolanus,89.0,1.1.294,SICINIUS,"Let's hence, and hear"
24786,24787,Coriolanus,89.0,1.1.295,SICINIUS,"How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,"
24787,24788,Coriolanus,89.0,1.1.296,SICINIUS,"More than his singularity, he goes"
24788,24789,Coriolanus,89.0,1.1.297,SICINIUS,Upon this present action.
24789,24790,Coriolanus,90.0,1.1.298,BRUTUS,Lets along.

24794,24795,Coriolanus,1.0,1.2.2,First Senator,That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
24795,24796,Coriolanus,1.0,1.2.3,First Senator,And know how we proceed.
24796,24797,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.4,AUFIDIUS,Is it not yours?
24797,24798,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.5,AUFIDIUS,"What ever have been thought on in this state,"
24798,24799,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.6,AUFIDIUS,That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
24799,24800,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.7,AUFIDIUS,Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
24800,24801,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.8,AUFIDIUS,"Since I heard thence, these are the words: I think"
24801,24802,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.9,AUFIDIUS,"I have the letter here, yes, here it is."
24802,24803,Coriolanus,2.0,,AUFIDIUS,Reads

24806,24807,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.13,AUFIDIUS,"Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,"
24807,24808,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.14,AUFIDIUS,"Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,"
24808,24809,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.15,AUFIDIUS,"And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,"
24809,24810,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.16,AUFIDIUS,These three lead on this preparation
24810,24811,Coriolanus,2.0,1.2.17,AUFIDIUS,Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:

24815,24816,Coriolanus,4.0,1.2.22,AUFIDIUS,Nor did you think it folly
24816,24817,Coriolanus,4.0,1.2.23,AUFIDIUS,To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
24817,24818,Coriolanus,4.0,1.2.24,AUFIDIUS,"They needs must show themselves, which"

24821,24822,Coriolanus,4.0,1.2.28,AUFIDIUS,To take in many towns ere almost Rome
24822,24823,Coriolanus,4.0,1.2.29,AUFIDIUS,Should know we were afoot.
24823,24824,Coriolanus,5.0,1.2.30,Second Senator,"Noble Aufidius,"

24829,24830,Coriolanus,6.0,1.2.36,AUFIDIUS,"O, doubt not that,"
24830,24831,Coriolanus,6.0,1.2.37,AUFIDIUS,"I speak from certainties. Nay, more,"

25379,25380,Coriolanus,5.0,1.10.30,AUFIDIUS,Be hostages for Rome.
25380,25381,Coriolanus,6.0,1.10.31,First Soldier,Will not you go?
25381,25382,Coriolanus,7.0,1.10.32,AUFIDIUS,I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--

25388,25389,Coriolanus,8.0,,First Soldier,SCENE I. Rome. A public place.
25389,25390,Coriolanus,8.0,,First Soldier,"Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS."
25390,25391,Coriolanus,1.0,2.1.1,MENENIUS,The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
25391,25392,Coriolanus,2.0,2.1.2,BRUTUS,Good or bad?
25392,25393,Coriolanus,3.0,2.1.3,MENENIUS,"Not according to the prayer of the people, for they"
25393,25394,Coriolanus,3.0,2.1.4,MENENIUS,love not Marcius.
25394,25395,Coriolanus,4.0,2.1.5,SICINIUS,Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
25395,25396,Coriolanus,5.0,2.1.6,MENENIUS,"Pray you, who does the wolf love?"
25396,25397,Coriolanus,6.0,2.1.7,SICINIUS,The lamb.
25397,25398,Coriolanus,7.0,2.1.8,MENENIUS,"Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the"
25398,25399,Coriolanus,7.0,2.1.9,MENENIUS,noble Marcius.
25399,25400,Coriolanus,8.0,2.1.10,BRUTUS,"He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear."
25400,25401,Coriolanus,9.0,2.1.11,MENENIUS,"He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two"
25401,25402,Coriolanus,9.0,2.1.12,MENENIUS,are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
25402,25403,Coriolanus,10.0,2.1.13,Both,"Well, sir."
25403,25404,Coriolanus,11.0,2.1.14,MENENIUS,"In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two"
25404,25405,Coriolanus,11.0,2.1.15,MENENIUS,have not in abundance?
25405,25406,Coriolanus,12.0,2.1.16,BRUTUS,"He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all."
25406,25407,Coriolanus,13.0,2.1.17,SICINIUS,Especially in pride.
25407,25408,Coriolanus,14.0,2.1.18,BRUTUS,And topping all others in boasting.
25408,25409,Coriolanus,15.0,2.1.19,MENENIUS,This is strange now: do you two know how you are
25409,25410,Coriolanus,15.0,2.1.20,MENENIUS,"censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the"
25410,25411,Coriolanus,15.0,2.1.21,MENENIUS,right-hand file? do you?
25411,25412,Coriolanus,16.0,2.1.22,Both,"Why, how are we censured?"
25412,25413,Coriolanus,17.0,2.1.23,MENENIUS,"Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?"
25413,25414,Coriolanus,18.0,2.1.24,Both,"Well, well, sir, well."
25414,25415,Coriolanus,19.0,2.1.25,MENENIUS,"Why, 'tis no great matter, for a very little thief of"
25415,25416,Coriolanus,19.0,2.1.26,MENENIUS,occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
25416,25417,Coriolanus,19.0,2.1.27,MENENIUS,"give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at"
25417,25418,Coriolanus,19.0,2.1.28,MENENIUS,"your pleasures, at the least if you take it as a"
25418,25419,Coriolanus,19.0,2.1.29,MENENIUS,pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
25419,25420,Coriolanus,19.0,2.1.30,MENENIUS,being proud?
25420,25421,Coriolanus,20.0,2.1.31,BRUTUS,"We do it not alone, sir."
25421,25422,Coriolanus,21.0,2.1.32,MENENIUS,"I know you can do very little alone, for your helps"
25422,25423,Coriolanus,21.0,2.1.33,MENENIUS,"are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous"
25423,25424,Coriolanus,21.0,2.1.34,MENENIUS,single: your abilities are too infant-like for
25424,25425,Coriolanus,21.0,2.1.35,MENENIUS,doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
25425,25426,Coriolanus,21.0,2.1.36,MENENIUS,"could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,"
25426,25427,Coriolanus,21.0,2.1.37,MENENIUS,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
25427,25428,Coriolanus,21.0,2.1.38,MENENIUS,O that you could!
25428,25429,Coriolanus,22.0,2.1.39,BRUTUS,"What then, sir?"
25429,25430,Coriolanus,23.0,2.1.40,MENENIUS,"Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,"
25430,25431,Coriolanus,23.0,2.1.41,MENENIUS,"proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as"
25431,25432,Coriolanus,23.0,2.1.42,MENENIUS,any in Rome.
25432,25433,Coriolanus,24.0,2.1.43,SICINIUS,"Menenius, you are known well enough too."
25433,25434,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.44,MENENIUS,"I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that"
25434,25435,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.45,MENENIUS,loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
25435,25436,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.46,MENENIUS,"Tiber in't, said to be something imperfect in"
25436,25437,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.47,MENENIUS,"favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like"
25437,25438,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.48,MENENIUS,"upon too trivial motion, one that converses more"
25438,25439,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.49,MENENIUS,with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
25439,25440,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.50,MENENIUS,"of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my"
25440,25441,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.51,MENENIUS,malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
25441,25442,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.52,MENENIUS,you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
25442,25443,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.53,MENENIUS,"you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a"
25443,25444,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.54,MENENIUS,crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
25444,25445,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.55,MENENIUS,"delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in"
25445,25446,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.56,MENENIUS,compound with the major part of your syllables: and
25446,25447,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.57,MENENIUS,though I must be content to bear with those that say
25447,25448,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.58,MENENIUS,"you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that"
25448,25449,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.59,MENENIUS,tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
25449,25450,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.60,MENENIUS,"the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known"
25450,25451,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.61,MENENIUS,well enough too? what barm can your bisson
25451,25452,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.62,MENENIUS,"conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be"
25452,25453,Coriolanus,25.0,2.1.63,MENENIUS,known well enough too?
25453,25454,Coriolanus,26.0,2.1.64,BRUTUS,"Come, sir, come, we know you well enough."
25454,25455,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.65,MENENIUS,"You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You"
25455,25456,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.66,MENENIUS,are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
25456,25457,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.67,MENENIUS,wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
25457,25458,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.68,MENENIUS,"cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller,"
25458,25459,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.69,MENENIUS,and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
25459,25460,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.70,MENENIUS,second day of audience. When you are hearing a
25460,25461,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.71,MENENIUS,"matter between party and party, if you chance to be"
25461,25462,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.72,MENENIUS,"pinched with the colic, you make faces like"
25462,25463,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.73,MENENIUS,"mummers, set up the bloody flag against all"
25463,25464,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.74,MENENIUS,"patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,"
25464,25465,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.75,MENENIUS,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
25465,25466,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.76,MENENIUS,by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
25466,25467,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.77,MENENIUS,"cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are"
25467,25468,Coriolanus,27.0,2.1.78,MENENIUS,a pair of strange ones.
25468,25469,Coriolanus,28.0,2.1.79,BRUTUS,"Come, come, you are well understood to be a"
25469,25470,Coriolanus,28.0,2.1.80,BRUTUS,perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
25470,25471,Coriolanus,28.0,2.1.81,BRUTUS,bencher in the Capitol.
25471,25472,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.82,MENENIUS,"Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall"
25472,25473,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.83,MENENIUS,encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
25473,25474,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.84,MENENIUS,"you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the"
25474,25475,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.85,MENENIUS,"wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not"
25475,25476,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.86,MENENIUS,so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
25476,25477,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.87,MENENIUS,"cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-"
25477,25478,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.88,MENENIUS,"saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud,"
25478,25479,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.89,MENENIUS,"who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors"
25479,25480,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.90,MENENIUS,"since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the"
25480,25481,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.91,MENENIUS,best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
25481,25482,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.92,MENENIUS,your worships: more of your conversation would
25482,25483,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.93,MENENIUS,"infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly"
25483,25484,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.94,MENENIUS,plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
25484,25485,Coriolanus,29.0,,MENENIUS,BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside
25485,25486,Coriolanus,29.0,,MENENIUS,"Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA"
25486,25487,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.95,MENENIUS,"How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,"
25487,25488,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.96,MENENIUS,"were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow"
25488,25489,Coriolanus,29.0,2.1.97,MENENIUS,your eyes so fast?
25489,25490,Coriolanus,30.0,2.1.98,VOLUMNIA,"Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches, for"

25491,25492,Coriolanus,31.0,2.1.100,MENENIUS,Ha! Marcius coming home!
25492,25493,Coriolanus,32.0,2.1.101,VOLUMNIA,"Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous"
25493,25494,Coriolanus,32.0,2.1.102,VOLUMNIA,approbation.
25494,25495,Coriolanus,33.0,2.1.103,MENENIUS,"Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!"
25495,25496,Coriolanus,33.0,2.1.104,MENENIUS,Marcius coming home!
25496,25497,Coriolanus,35.0,2.1.105,VIRGILIA,"Nay,'tis true."
25497,25498,Coriolanus,36.0,2.1.106,VOLUMNIA,"Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath"
25498,25499,Coriolanus,36.0,2.1.107,VOLUMNIA,"another, his wife another, and, I think, there's one"
25499,25500,Coriolanus,36.0,2.1.108,VOLUMNIA,at home for you.
25500,25501,Coriolanus,37.0,2.1.109,MENENIUS,I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
25501,25502,Coriolanus,37.0,2.1.110,MENENIUS,me!
25502,25503,Coriolanus,38.0,2.1.111,VIRGILIA,"Yes, certain, there's a letter for you, I saw't."
25503,25504,Coriolanus,39.0,2.1.112,MENENIUS,A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
25504,25505,Coriolanus,39.0,2.1.113,MENENIUS,"years' health, in which time I will make a lip at"
25505,25506,Coriolanus,39.0,2.1.114,MENENIUS,the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
25506,25507,Coriolanus,39.0,2.1.115,MENENIUS,"Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,"
25507,25508,Coriolanus,39.0,2.1.116,MENENIUS,of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
25508,25509,Coriolanus,39.0,2.1.117,MENENIUS,not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
25509,25510,Coriolanus,40.0,2.1.118,VIRGILIA,"O, no, no, no."
25510,25511,Coriolanus,41.0,2.1.119,VOLUMNIA,"O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't."
25511,25512,Coriolanus,42.0,2.1.120,MENENIUS,"So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'"
25512,25513,Coriolanus,42.0,2.1.121,MENENIUS,victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
25513,25514,Coriolanus,43.0,2.1.122,VOLUMNIA,"On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home"
25514,25515,Coriolanus,43.0,2.1.123,VOLUMNIA,with the oaken garland.
25515,25516,Coriolanus,44.0,2.1.124,MENENIUS,Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
25516,25517,Coriolanus,45.0,2.1.125,VOLUMNIA,"Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but"
25517,25518,Coriolanus,45.0,2.1.126,VOLUMNIA,Aufidius got off.
25518,25519,Coriolanus,46.0,2.1.127,MENENIUS,"And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:"
25519,25520,Coriolanus,46.0,2.1.128,MENENIUS,"an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so"
25520,25521,Coriolanus,46.0,2.1.129,MENENIUS,"fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold"
25521,25522,Coriolanus,46.0,2.1.130,MENENIUS,that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
25522,25523,Coriolanus,47.0,2.1.131,VOLUMNIA,"Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes, the senate"
25523,25524,Coriolanus,47.0,2.1.132,VOLUMNIA,"has letters from the general, wherein he gives my"
25524,25525,Coriolanus,47.0,2.1.133,VOLUMNIA,son the whole name of the war: he hath in this

25526,25527,Coriolanus,48.0,2.1.135,VALERIA,"In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him."
25527,25528,Coriolanus,49.0,2.1.136,MENENIUS,"Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his"
25528,25529,Coriolanus,49.0,2.1.137,MENENIUS,true purchasing.
25529,25530,Coriolanus,50.0,2.1.138,VIRGILIA,The gods grant them true!
25530,25531,Coriolanus,51.0,2.1.139,VOLUMNIA,"True! pow, wow."
25531,25532,Coriolanus,52.0,2.1.140,MENENIUS,True! I'll be sworn they are true.
25532,25533,Coriolanus,52.0,2.1.141,MENENIUS,Where is he wounded?
25533,25534,Coriolanus,52.0,,MENENIUS,To the Tribunes
25534,25535,Coriolanus,52.0,2.1.142,MENENIUS,God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
25535,25536,Coriolanus,52.0,2.1.143,MENENIUS,home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
25536,25537,Coriolanus,53.0,2.1.144,VOLUMNIA,I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
25537,25538,Coriolanus,53.0,2.1.145,VOLUMNIA,"large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall"
25538,25539,Coriolanus,53.0,2.1.146,VOLUMNIA,stand for his place. He received in the repulse of

25624,25625,Coriolanus,76.0,2.1.226,BRUTUS,As if that whatsoever god who leads him
25625,25626,Coriolanus,76.0,2.1.227,BRUTUS,Were slily crept into his human powers
25626,25627,Coriolanus,76.0,2.1.228,BRUTUS,And gave him graceful posture.

25641,25642,Coriolanus,82.0,2.1.243,BRUTUS,"I heard him swear,"
25642,25643,Coriolanus,82.0,2.1.244,BRUTUS,"Were he to stand for consul, never would he"
25643,25644,Coriolanus,82.0,2.1.245,BRUTUS,Appear i' the market-place nor on him put

25645,25646,Coriolanus,82.0,2.1.247,BRUTUS,"Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds"
25646,25647,Coriolanus,82.0,2.1.248,BRUTUS,"To the people, beg their stinking breaths."
25647,25648,Coriolanus,83.0,2.1.249,SICINIUS,'Tis right.
25648,25649,Coriolanus,84.0,2.1.250,BRUTUS,"It was his word: O, he would miss it rather"
25649,25650,Coriolanus,84.0,2.1.251,BRUTUS,"Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,"
25650,25651,Coriolanus,84.0,2.1.252,BRUTUS,And the desire of the nobles.
25651,25652,Coriolanus,85.0,2.1.253,SICINIUS,I wish no better
25652,25653,Coriolanus,85.0,2.1.254,SICINIUS,Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
25653,25654,Coriolanus,85.0,2.1.255,SICINIUS,In execution.
25654,25655,Coriolanus,86.0,2.1.256,BRUTUS,'Tis most like he will.

25657,25658,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.259,BRUTUS,So it must fall out

25659,25660,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.261,BRUTUS,We must suggest the people in what hatred

25661,25662,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.263,BRUTUS,"Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and"
25662,25663,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.264,BRUTUS,"Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,"

25664,25665,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.266,BRUTUS,Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
25665,25666,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.267,BRUTUS,"Than camels in the war, who have their provand"
25666,25667,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.268,BRUTUS,"Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows"
25667,25668,Coriolanus,88.0,2.1.269,BRUTUS,For sinking under them.
25668,25669,Coriolanus,89.0,2.1.270,SICINIUS,"This, as you say, suggested"
25669,25670,Coriolanus,89.0,2.1.271,SICINIUS,At some time when his soaring insolence
25670,25671,Coriolanus,89.0,2.1.272,SICINIUS,"Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,"
25671,25672,Coriolanus,89.0,2.1.273,SICINIUS,"If he be put upon 't, and that's as easy"
25672,25673,Coriolanus,89.0,2.1.274,SICINIUS,As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire

25674,25675,Coriolanus,89.0,2.1.276,SICINIUS,Shall darken him for ever.

25684,25685,Coriolanus,91.0,2.1.285,Messenger,A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
25685,25686,Coriolanus,91.0,2.1.286,Messenger,I never saw the like.
25686,25687,Coriolanus,92.0,2.1.287,BRUTUS,"Let's to the Capitol,"
25687,25688,Coriolanus,92.0,2.1.288,BRUTUS,"And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,"
25688,25689,Coriolanus,92.0,2.1.289,BRUTUS,But hearts for the event.
25689,25690,Coriolanus,93.0,2.1.290,SICINIUS,Have with you.

25698,25699,Coriolanus,3.0,2.2.6,First Officer,loves not the common people.
25699,25700,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.7,Second Officer,"Faith, there had been many great men that have"
25700,25701,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.8,Second Officer,"flattered the people, who ne'er loved them, and there"

25702,25703,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.10,Second Officer,"wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,"
25703,25704,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.11,Second Officer,"they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for"
25704,25705,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.12,Second Officer,Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
25705,25706,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.13,Second Officer,him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
25706,25707,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.14,Second Officer,"disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets"
25707,25708,Coriolanus,4.0,2.2.15,Second Officer,them plainly see't.
25708,25709,Coriolanus,5.0,2.2.16,First Officer,"If he did not care whether he had their love or no,"
25709,25710,Coriolanus,5.0,2.2.17,First Officer,he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
25710,25711,Coriolanus,5.0,2.2.18,First Officer,good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
25711,25712,Coriolanus,5.0,2.2.19,First Officer,"devotion than can render it him, and leaves"
25712,25713,Coriolanus,5.0,2.2.20,First Officer,nothing undone that may fully discover him their

25716,25717,Coriolanus,6.0,2.2.24,Second Officer,He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his

25720,25721,Coriolanus,6.0,2.2.28,Second Officer,an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
25721,25722,Coriolanus,6.0,2.2.29,Second Officer,"planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions"
25722,25723,Coriolanus,6.0,2.2.30,Second Officer,"in their hearts, that for their tongues to be"
25723,25724,Coriolanus,6.0,2.2.31,Second Officer,"silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of"

25741,25742,Coriolanus,8.0,2.2.48,MENENIUS,We met here both to thank and to remember

25751,25752,Coriolanus,9.0,2.2.57,First Senator,To yield what passes here.
25752,25753,Coriolanus,10.0,2.2.58,SICINIUS,We are convented

25755,25756,Coriolanus,10.0,2.2.61,SICINIUS,The theme of our assembly.
25756,25757,Coriolanus,11.0,2.2.62,BRUTUS,Which the rather

25760,25761,Coriolanus,12.0,2.2.66,MENENIUS,"That's off, that's off,"
25761,25762,Coriolanus,12.0,2.2.67,MENENIUS,I would you rather had been silent. Please you
25762,25763,Coriolanus,12.0,2.2.68,MENENIUS,To hear Cominius speak?
25763,25764,Coriolanus,13.0,2.2.69,BRUTUS,"Most willingly,"
25764,25765,Coriolanus,13.0,2.2.70,BRUTUS,But yet my caution was more pertinent
25765,25766,Coriolanus,13.0,2.2.71,BRUTUS,Than the rebuke you give it.
25766,25767,Coriolanus,14.0,2.2.72,MENENIUS,He loves your people
25767,25768,Coriolanus,14.0,2.2.73,MENENIUS,But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
25768,25769,Coriolanus,14.0,2.2.74,MENENIUS,"Worthy Cominius, speak."

25772,25773,Coriolanus,15.0,2.2.77,First Senator,What you have nobly done.
25773,25774,Coriolanus,16.0,2.2.78,CORIOLANUS,Your horror's pardon:
25774,25775,Coriolanus,16.0,2.2.79,CORIOLANUS,I had rather have my wounds to heal again
25775,25776,Coriolanus,16.0,2.2.80,CORIOLANUS,Than hear say how I got them.
25776,25777,Coriolanus,17.0,2.2.81,BRUTUS,"Sir, I hope"
25777,25778,Coriolanus,17.0,2.2.82,BRUTUS,My words disbench'd you not.
25778,25779,Coriolanus,18.0,2.2.83,CORIOLANUS,"No, sir: yet oft,"
25779,25780,Coriolanus,18.0,2.2.84,CORIOLANUS,"When blows have made me stay, I fled from words."
25780,25781,Coriolanus,18.0,2.2.85,CORIOLANUS,"You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but"

25782,25783,Coriolanus,18.0,2.2.87,CORIOLANUS,I love them as they weigh.
25783,25784,Coriolanus,19.0,2.2.88,MENENIUS,"Pray now, sit down."
25784,25785,Coriolanus,20.0,2.2.89,CORIOLANUS,I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
25785,25786,Coriolanus,20.0,2.2.90,CORIOLANUS,When the alarum were struck than idly sit
25786,25787,Coriolanus,20.0,2.2.91,CORIOLANUS,To hear my nothings monster'd.
25787,25788,Coriolanus,20.0,,CORIOLANUS,Exit

25789,25790,Coriolanus,21.0,2.2.93,MENENIUS,Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
25790,25791,Coriolanus,21.0,2.2.94,MENENIUS,That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
25791,25792,Coriolanus,21.0,2.2.95,MENENIUS,He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
25792,25793,Coriolanus,21.0,2.2.96,MENENIUS,"Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius."
25793,25794,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.97,COMINIUS,I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
25794,25795,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.98,COMINIUS,Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
25795,25796,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.99,COMINIUS,"That valour is the chiefest virtue, and"
25796,25797,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.100,COMINIUS,"Most dignifies the haver: if it be,"
25797,25798,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.101,COMINIUS,The man I speak of cannot in the world
25798,25799,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.102,COMINIUS,"Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,"
25799,25800,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.103,COMINIUS,"When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought"
25800,25801,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.104,COMINIUS,"Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,"
25801,25802,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.105,COMINIUS,"Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,"
25802,25803,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.106,COMINIUS,When with his Amazonian chin he drove
25803,25804,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.107,COMINIUS,The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
25804,25805,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.108,COMINIUS,An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
25805,25806,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.109,COMINIUS,"Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,"
25806,25807,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.110,COMINIUS,"And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,"
25807,25808,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.111,COMINIUS,"When he might act the woman in the scene,"
25808,25809,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.112,COMINIUS,"He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed"
25809,25810,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.113,COMINIUS,Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
25810,25811,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.114,COMINIUS,"Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,"
25811,25812,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.115,COMINIUS,And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
25812,25813,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.116,COMINIUS,"He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,"
25813,25814,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.117,COMINIUS,"Before and in Corioli, let me say,"
25814,25815,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.118,COMINIUS,"I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers,"
25815,25816,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.119,COMINIUS,And by his rare example made the coward
25816,25817,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.120,COMINIUS,Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
25817,25818,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.121,COMINIUS,"A vessel under sail, so men obey'd"
25818,25819,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.122,COMINIUS,"And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,"
25819,25820,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.123,COMINIUS,"Where it did mark, it took, from face to foot"
25820,25821,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.124,COMINIUS,"He was a thing of blood, whose every motion"
25821,25822,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.125,COMINIUS,Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
25822,25823,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.126,COMINIUS,"The mortal gate of the city, which he painted"
25823,25824,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.127,COMINIUS,"With shunless destiny, aidless came off,"
25824,25825,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.128,COMINIUS,And with a sudden reinforcement struck
25825,25826,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.129,COMINIUS,Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
25826,25827,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.130,COMINIUS,"When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce"
25827,25828,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.131,COMINIUS,"His ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit"
25828,25829,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.132,COMINIUS,"Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,"
25829,25830,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.133,COMINIUS,"And to the battle came he, where he did"
25830,25831,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.134,COMINIUS,"Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if"
25831,25832,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.135,COMINIUS,'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
25832,25833,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.136,COMINIUS,"Both field and city ours, he never stood"
25833,25834,Coriolanus,22.0,2.2.137,COMINIUS,To ease his breast with panting.
25834,25835,Coriolanus,23.0,2.2.138,MENENIUS,Worthy man!
25835,25836,Coriolanus,24.0,2.2.139,First Senator,He cannot but with measure fit the honours
25836,25837,Coriolanus,24.0,2.2.140,First Senator,Which we devise him.
25837,25838,Coriolanus,25.0,2.2.141,COMINIUS,"Our spoils he kick'd at,"
25838,25839,Coriolanus,25.0,2.2.142,COMINIUS,And look'd upon things precious as they were
25839,25840,Coriolanus,25.0,2.2.143,COMINIUS,The common muck of the world: he covets less
25840,25841,Coriolanus,25.0,2.2.144,COMINIUS,"Than misery itself would give, rewards"
25841,25842,Coriolanus,25.0,2.2.145,COMINIUS,"His deeds with doing them, and is content"
25842,25843,Coriolanus,25.0,2.2.146,COMINIUS,To spend the time to end it.
25843,25844,Coriolanus,26.0,2.2.147,MENENIUS,He's right noble:
25844,25845,Coriolanus,26.0,2.2.148,MENENIUS,Let him be call'd for.
25845,25846,Coriolanus,27.0,2.2.149,First Senator,Call Coriolanus.
25846,25847,Coriolanus,28.0,2.2.150,Officer,He doth appear.
25847,25848,Coriolanus,28.0,,Officer,Re-enter CORIOLANUS
25848,25849,Coriolanus,29.0,2.2.151,MENENIUS,"The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased"
25849,25850,Coriolanus,29.0,2.2.152,MENENIUS,To make thee consul.
25850,25851,Coriolanus,30.0,2.2.153,CORIOLANUS,I do owe them still
25851,25852,Coriolanus,30.0,2.2.154,CORIOLANUS,My life and services.
25852,25853,Coriolanus,31.0,2.2.155,MENENIUS,It then remains
25853,25854,Coriolanus,31.0,2.2.156,MENENIUS,That you do speak to the people.
25854,25855,Coriolanus,32.0,2.2.157,CORIOLANUS,"I do beseech you,"
25855,25856,Coriolanus,32.0,2.2.158,CORIOLANUS,"Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot"
25856,25857,Coriolanus,32.0,2.2.159,CORIOLANUS,"Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,"
25857,25858,Coriolanus,32.0,2.2.160,CORIOLANUS,"For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you"
25858,25859,Coriolanus,32.0,2.2.161,CORIOLANUS,That I may pass this doing.
25859,25860,Coriolanus,33.0,2.2.162,SICINIUS,"Sir, the people"
25860,25861,Coriolanus,33.0,2.2.163,SICINIUS,"Must have their voices, neither will they bate"
25861,25862,Coriolanus,33.0,2.2.164,SICINIUS,One jot of ceremony.
25862,25863,Coriolanus,34.0,2.2.165,MENENIUS,Put them not to't:
25863,25864,Coriolanus,34.0,2.2.166,MENENIUS,"Pray you, go fit you to the custom and"
25864,25865,Coriolanus,34.0,2.2.167,MENENIUS,"Take to you, as your predecessors have,"
25865,25866,Coriolanus,34.0,2.2.168,MENENIUS,Your honour with your form.
25866,25867,Coriolanus,35.0,2.2.169,CORIOLANUS,It is apart
25867,25868,Coriolanus,35.0,2.2.170,CORIOLANUS,"That I shall blush in acting, and might well"
25868,25869,Coriolanus,35.0,2.2.171,CORIOLANUS,Be taken from the people.
25869,25870,Coriolanus,36.0,2.2.172,BRUTUS,Mark you that?
25870,25871,Coriolanus,37.0,2.2.173,CORIOLANUS,"To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus,"
25871,25872,Coriolanus,37.0,2.2.174,CORIOLANUS,"Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,"
25872,25873,Coriolanus,37.0,2.2.175,CORIOLANUS,As if I had received them for the hire
25873,25874,Coriolanus,37.0,2.2.176,CORIOLANUS,Of their breath only!
25874,25875,Coriolanus,38.0,2.2.177,MENENIUS,Do not stand upon't.
25875,25876,Coriolanus,38.0,2.2.178,MENENIUS,"We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,"

25881,25882,Coriolanus,41.0,2.2.183,SICINIUS,"May they perceive's intent! He will require them,"
25882,25883,Coriolanus,41.0,2.2.184,SICINIUS,As if he did contemn what he requested
25883,25884,Coriolanus,41.0,2.2.185,SICINIUS,Should be in them to give.
25884,25885,Coriolanus,42.0,2.2.186,BRUTUS,"Come, we'll inform them"

25893,25894,Coriolanus,3.0,2.3.4,Third Citizen,"power that we have no power to do, for if he show us"

25895,25896,Coriolanus,3.0,2.3.6,Third Citizen,"tongues into those wounds and speak for them, so, if"
25896,25897,Coriolanus,3.0,2.3.7,Third Citizen,"he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him"
25897,25898,Coriolanus,3.0,2.3.8,Third Citizen,our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
25898,25899,Coriolanus,3.0,2.3.9,Third Citizen,"monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,"
25899,25900,Coriolanus,3.0,2.3.10,Third Citizen,were to make a monster of the multitude: of the

25903,25904,Coriolanus,4.0,2.3.14,First Citizen,"will serve, for once we stood up about the corn, he"
25904,25905,Coriolanus,4.0,2.3.15,First Citizen,himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
25905,25906,Coriolanus,5.0,2.3.16,Third Citizen,"We have been called so of many, not that our heads"
25906,25907,Coriolanus,5.0,2.3.17,Third Citizen,"are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,"
25907,25908,Coriolanus,5.0,2.3.18,Third Citizen,but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
25908,25909,Coriolanus,5.0,2.3.19,Third Citizen,truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
25909,25910,Coriolanus,5.0,2.3.20,Third Citizen,"one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,"
25910,25911,Coriolanus,5.0,2.3.21,Third Citizen,and their consent of one direct way should be at
25911,25912,Coriolanus,5.0,2.3.22,Third Citizen,once to all the points o' the compass.

25914,25915,Coriolanus,7.0,2.3.25,Third Citizen,"Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's"

25917,25918,Coriolanus,8.0,2.3.28,Second Citizen,Why that way?
25918,25919,Coriolanus,9.0,2.3.29,Third Citizen,"To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts"
25919,25920,Coriolanus,9.0,2.3.30,Third Citizen,"melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return"
25920,25921,Coriolanus,9.0,2.3.31,Third Citizen,"for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife."
25921,25922,Coriolanus,10.0,2.3.32,Second Citizen,"You are never without your tricks: you may, you may."
25922,25923,Coriolanus,11.0,2.3.33,Third Citizen,Are you all resolved to give your voices? But

26000,26001,Coriolanus,37.0,2.3.104,CORIOLANUS,"bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,"
26001,26002,Coriolanus,37.0,2.3.105,CORIOLANUS,I may be consul.

26069,26070,Coriolanus,65.0,2.3.167,Second Citizen,"Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says"
26070,26071,Coriolanus,65.0,2.3.168,Second Citizen,He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
26071,26072,Coriolanus,65.0,2.3.169,Second Citizen,"His marks of merit, wounds received for's country."
26072,26073,Coriolanus,66.0,2.3.170,SICINIUS,"Why, so he did, I am sure."
26073,26074,Coriolanus,67.0,2.3.171,Citizens,"No, no, no man saw 'em."
26074,26075,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.172,Third Citizen,"He said he had wounds, which he could show"
26075,26076,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.173,Third Citizen,"in private,"
26076,26077,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.174,Third Citizen,"And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,"
26077,26078,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.175,Third Citizen,"'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,"
26078,26079,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.176,Third Citizen,"But by your voices, will not so permit me,"
26079,26080,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.177,Third Citizen,"Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,"
26080,26081,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.178,Third Citizen,Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
26081,26082,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.179,Third Citizen,Your most sweet voices: now you have left
26082,26083,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.180,Third Citizen,"your voices,"
26083,26084,Coriolanus,68.0,2.3.181,Third Citizen,I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
26084,26085,Coriolanus,69.0,2.3.182,SICINIUS,"Why either were you ignorant to see't,"
26085,26086,Coriolanus,69.0,2.3.183,SICINIUS,"Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness"
26086,26087,Coriolanus,69.0,2.3.184,SICINIUS,To yield your voices?
26087,26088,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.185,BRUTUS,Could you not have told him
26088,26089,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.186,BRUTUS,"As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,"
26089,26090,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.187,BRUTUS,"But was a petty servant to the state,"
26090,26091,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.188,BRUTUS,"He was your enemy, ever spake against"
26091,26092,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.189,BRUTUS,Your liberties and the charters that you bear
26092,26093,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.190,BRUTUS,"I' the body of the weal, and now, arriving"
26093,26094,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.191,BRUTUS,"A place of potency and sway o' the state,"
26094,26095,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.192,BRUTUS,If he should still malignantly remain
26095,26096,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.193,BRUTUS,"Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might"
26096,26097,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.194,BRUTUS,Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
26097,26098,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.195,BRUTUS,That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
26098,26099,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.196,BRUTUS,"Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature"
26099,26100,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.197,BRUTUS,Would think upon you for your voices and
26100,26101,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.198,BRUTUS,"Translate his malice towards you into love,"
26101,26102,Coriolanus,70.0,2.3.199,BRUTUS,Standing your friendly lord.
26102,26103,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.200,SICINIUS,"Thus to have said,"
26103,26104,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.201,SICINIUS,"As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit"
26104,26105,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.202,SICINIUS,"And tried his inclination, from him pluck'd"
26105,26106,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.203,SICINIUS,"Either his gracious promise, which you might,"
26106,26107,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.204,SICINIUS,"As cause had call'd you up, have held him to"
26107,26108,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.205,SICINIUS,"Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,"
26108,26109,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.206,SICINIUS,Which easily endures not article
26109,26110,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.207,SICINIUS,"Tying him to aught, so putting him to rage,"
26110,26111,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.208,SICINIUS,You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
26111,26112,Coriolanus,71.0,2.3.209,SICINIUS,And pass'd him unelected.
26112,26113,Coriolanus,72.0,2.3.210,BRUTUS,Did you perceive
26113,26114,Coriolanus,72.0,2.3.211,BRUTUS,He did solicit you in free contempt
26114,26115,Coriolanus,72.0,2.3.212,BRUTUS,"When he did need your loves, and do you think"
26115,26116,Coriolanus,72.0,2.3.213,BRUTUS,"That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,"
26116,26117,Coriolanus,72.0,2.3.214,BRUTUS,"When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies"
26117,26118,Coriolanus,72.0,2.3.215,BRUTUS,No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
26118,26119,Coriolanus,72.0,2.3.216,BRUTUS,Against the rectorship of judgment?
26119,26120,Coriolanus,73.0,2.3.217,SICINIUS,Have you
26120,26121,Coriolanus,73.0,2.3.218,SICINIUS,Ere now denied the asker? and now again
26121,26122,Coriolanus,73.0,2.3.219,SICINIUS,"Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow"
26122,26123,Coriolanus,73.0,2.3.220,SICINIUS,Your sued-for tongues?
26123,26124,Coriolanus,74.0,2.3.221,Third Citizen,"He's not confirm'd, we may deny him yet."
26124,26125,Coriolanus,75.0,2.3.222,Second Citizen,And will deny him:
26125,26126,Coriolanus,75.0,2.3.223,Second Citizen,I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
26126,26127,Coriolanus,76.0,2.3.224,First Citizen,I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
26127,26128,Coriolanus,77.0,2.3.225,BRUTUS,"Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,"
26128,26129,Coriolanus,77.0,2.3.226,BRUTUS,They have chose a consul that will from them take
26129,26130,Coriolanus,77.0,2.3.227,BRUTUS,"Their liberties, make them of no more voice"
26130,26131,Coriolanus,77.0,2.3.228,BRUTUS,Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
26131,26132,Coriolanus,77.0,2.3.229,BRUTUS,As therefore kept to do so.
26132,26133,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.230,SICINIUS,"Let them assemble,"
26133,26134,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.231,SICINIUS,And on a safer judgment all revoke
26134,26135,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.232,SICINIUS,"Your ignorant election, enforce his pride,"
26135,26136,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.233,SICINIUS,"And his old hate unto you, besides, forget not"
26136,26137,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.234,SICINIUS,"With what contempt he wore the humble weed,"
26137,26138,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.235,SICINIUS,"How in his suit he scorn'd you, but your loves,"
26138,26139,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.236,SICINIUS,"Thinking upon his services, took from you"
26139,26140,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.237,SICINIUS,"The apprehension of his present portance,"
26140,26141,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.238,SICINIUS,"Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion"
26141,26142,Coriolanus,78.0,2.3.239,SICINIUS,After the inveterate hate he bears you.
26142,26143,Coriolanus,79.0,2.3.240,BRUTUS,Lay
26143,26144,Coriolanus,79.0,2.3.241,BRUTUS,"A fault on us, your tribunes, that we laboured,"
26144,26145,Coriolanus,79.0,2.3.242,BRUTUS,"No impediment between, but that you must"
26145,26146,Coriolanus,79.0,2.3.243,BRUTUS,Cast your election on him.
26146,26147,Coriolanus,80.0,2.3.244,SICINIUS,"Say, you chose him"
26147,26148,Coriolanus,80.0,2.3.245,SICINIUS,More after our commandment than as guided
26148,26149,Coriolanus,80.0,2.3.246,SICINIUS,"By your own true affections, and that your minds,"
26149,26150,Coriolanus,80.0,2.3.247,SICINIUS,Preoccupied with what you rather must do
26150,26151,Coriolanus,80.0,2.3.248,SICINIUS,"Than what you should, made you against the grain"
26151,26152,Coriolanus,80.0,2.3.249,SICINIUS,To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
26152,26153,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.250,BRUTUS,"Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you."
26153,26154,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.251,BRUTUS,"How youngly he began to serve his country,"
26154,26155,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.252,BRUTUS,"How long continued, and what stock he springs of,"
26155,26156,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.253,BRUTUS,"The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came"
26156,26157,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.254,BRUTUS,"That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,"
26157,26158,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.255,BRUTUS,"Who, after great Hostilius, here was king,"
26158,26159,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.256,BRUTUS,"Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,"
26159,26160,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.257,BRUTUS,"That our beat water brought by conduits hither,"
26160,26161,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.258,BRUTUS,"And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,"
26161,26162,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.259,BRUTUS,"Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,"
26162,26163,Coriolanus,81.0,2.3.260,BRUTUS,Was his great ancestor.
26163,26164,Coriolanus,82.0,2.3.261,SICINIUS,"One thus descended,"
26164,26165,Coriolanus,82.0,2.3.262,SICINIUS,That hath beside well in his person wrought
26165,26166,Coriolanus,82.0,2.3.263,SICINIUS,"To be set high in place, we did commend"
26166,26167,Coriolanus,82.0,2.3.264,SICINIUS,"To your remembrances: but you have found,"
26167,26168,Coriolanus,82.0,2.3.265,SICINIUS,"Scaling his present bearing with his past,"
26168,26169,Coriolanus,82.0,2.3.266,SICINIUS,"That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke"
26169,26170,Coriolanus,82.0,2.3.267,SICINIUS,Your sudden approbation.
26170,26171,Coriolanus,83.0,2.3.268,BRUTUS,"Say, you ne'er had done't--"
26171,26172,Coriolanus,83.0,2.3.269,BRUTUS,"Harp on that still--but by our putting on,"
26172,26173,Coriolanus,83.0,2.3.270,BRUTUS,"And presently, when you have drawn your number,"
26173,26174,Coriolanus,83.0,2.3.271,BRUTUS,Repair to the Capitol.
26174,26175,Coriolanus,84.0,2.3.272,All,We will so: almost all
26175,26176,Coriolanus,84.0,2.3.273,All,Repent in their election.
26176,26177,Coriolanus,84.0,,All,Exeunt Citizens
26177,26178,Coriolanus,85.0,2.3.274,BRUTUS,"Let them go on,"
26178,26179,Coriolanus,85.0,2.3.275,BRUTUS,"This mutiny were better put in hazard,"
26179,26180,Coriolanus,85.0,2.3.276,BRUTUS,"Than stay, past doubt, for greater:"
26180,26181,Coriolanus,85.0,2.3.277,BRUTUS,"If, as his nature is, he fall in rage"
26181,26182,Coriolanus,85.0,2.3.278,BRUTUS,"With their refusal, both observe and answer"
26182,26183,Coriolanus,85.0,2.3.279,BRUTUS,The vantage of his anger.
26183,26184,Coriolanus,86.0,2.3.280,SICINIUS,"To the Capitol, come:"
26184,26185,Coriolanus,86.0,2.3.281,SICINIUS,"We will be there before the stream o' the people,"
26185,26186,Coriolanus,86.0,2.3.282,SICINIUS,"And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,"
26186,26187,Coriolanus,86.0,2.3.283,SICINIUS,Which we have goaded onward.
26187,26188,Coriolanus,86.0,,SICINIUS,Exeunt
26188,26189,Coriolanus,86.0,,SICINIUS,ACT III
26189,26190,Coriolanus,86.0,,SICINIUS,SCENE I. Rome. A street.
26190,26191,Coriolanus,86.0,,SICINIUS,"Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators"
26191,26192,Coriolanus,1.0,3.1.1,CORIOLANUS,Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
26192,26193,Coriolanus,2.0,3.1.2,LARTIUS,"He had, my lord, and that it was which caused"
26193,26194,Coriolanus,2.0,3.1.3,LARTIUS,Our swifter composition.
26194,26195,Coriolanus,3.0,3.1.4,CORIOLANUS,"So then the Volsces stand but as at first,"
26195,26196,Coriolanus,3.0,3.1.5,CORIOLANUS,"Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road."
26196,26197,Coriolanus,3.0,3.1.6,CORIOLANUS,Upon's again.
26197,26198,Coriolanus,4.0,3.1.7,COMINIUS,"They are worn, lord consul, so,"
26198,26199,Coriolanus,4.0,3.1.8,COMINIUS,That we shall hardly in our ages see
26199,26200,Coriolanus,4.0,3.1.9,COMINIUS,Their banners wave again.
26200,26201,Coriolanus,5.0,3.1.10,CORIOLANUS,Saw you Aufidius?
26201,26202,Coriolanus,6.0,3.1.11,LARTIUS,"On safe-guard he  came to me, and did curse"
26202,26203,Coriolanus,6.0,3.1.12,LARTIUS,"Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely"
26203,26204,Coriolanus,6.0,3.1.13,LARTIUS,Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
26204,26205,Coriolanus,7.0,3.1.14,CORIOLANUS,Spoke he of me?
26205,26206,Coriolanus,8.0,3.1.15,LARTIUS,"He did, my lord."
26206,26207,Coriolanus,9.0,3.1.16,CORIOLANUS,How? what?
26207,26208,Coriolanus,10.0,3.1.17,LARTIUS,"How often he had met you, sword to sword,"
26208,26209,Coriolanus,10.0,3.1.18,LARTIUS,That of all things upon the earth he hated
26209,26210,Coriolanus,10.0,3.1.19,LARTIUS,"Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes"
26210,26211,Coriolanus,10.0,3.1.20,LARTIUS,"To hopeless restitution, so he might"
26211,26212,Coriolanus,10.0,3.1.21,LARTIUS,Be call'd your vanquisher.
26212,26213,Coriolanus,11.0,3.1.22,CORIOLANUS,At Antium lives he?
26213,26214,Coriolanus,12.0,3.1.23,LARTIUS,At Antium.
26214,26215,Coriolanus,13.0,3.1.24,CORIOLANUS,"I wish I had a cause to seek him there,"
26215,26216,Coriolanus,13.0,3.1.25,CORIOLANUS,To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
26216,26217,Coriolanus,13.0,,CORIOLANUS,Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
26217,26218,Coriolanus,13.0,3.1.26,CORIOLANUS,"Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,"
26218,26219,Coriolanus,13.0,3.1.27,CORIOLANUS,"The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them,"
26219,26220,Coriolanus,13.0,3.1.28,CORIOLANUS,"For they do prank them in authority,"
26220,26221,Coriolanus,13.0,3.1.29,CORIOLANUS,Against all noble sufferance.
26221,26222,Coriolanus,14.0,3.1.30,SICINIUS,Pass no further.
26222,26223,Coriolanus,15.0,3.1.31,CORIOLANUS,Ha! what is that?
26223,26224,Coriolanus,16.0,3.1.32,BRUTUS,It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
26224,26225,Coriolanus,17.0,3.1.33,CORIOLANUS,What makes this change?
26225,26226,Coriolanus,18.0,3.1.34,MENENIUS,The matter?
26226,26227,Coriolanus,19.0,3.1.35,COMINIUS,Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
26227,26228,Coriolanus,20.0,3.1.36,BRUTUS,"Cominius, no."
26228,26229,Coriolanus,21.0,3.1.37,CORIOLANUS,Have I had children's voices?
26229,26230,Coriolanus,22.0,3.1.38,First Senator,"Tribunes, give way, he shall to the market-place."
26230,26231,Coriolanus,23.0,3.1.39,BRUTUS,The people are incensed against him.
26231,26232,Coriolanus,24.0,3.1.40,SICINIUS,"Stop,"
26232,26233,Coriolanus,24.0,3.1.41,SICINIUS,Or all will fall in broil.
26233,26234,Coriolanus,25.0,3.1.42,CORIOLANUS,Are these your herd?
26234,26235,Coriolanus,25.0,3.1.43,CORIOLANUS,"Must these have voices, that can yield them now"
26235,26236,Coriolanus,25.0,3.1.44,CORIOLANUS,And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
26236,26237,Coriolanus,25.0,3.1.45,CORIOLANUS,your offices?
26237,26238,Coriolanus,25.0,3.1.46,CORIOLANUS,"You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?"
26238,26239,Coriolanus,25.0,3.1.47,CORIOLANUS,Have you not set them on?
26239,26240,Coriolanus,26.0,3.1.48,MENENIUS,"Be calm, be calm."
26240,26241,Coriolanus,27.0,3.1.49,CORIOLANUS,"It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,"
26241,26242,Coriolanus,27.0,3.1.50,CORIOLANUS,To curb the will of the nobility:
26242,26243,Coriolanus,27.0,3.1.51,CORIOLANUS,"Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule"
26243,26244,Coriolanus,27.0,3.1.52,CORIOLANUS,Nor ever will be ruled.
26244,26245,Coriolanus,28.0,3.1.53,BRUTUS,Call't not a plot:
26245,26246,Coriolanus,28.0,3.1.54,BRUTUS,"The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,"
26246,26247,Coriolanus,28.0,3.1.55,BRUTUS,"When corn was given them gratis, you repined,"
26247,26248,Coriolanus,28.0,3.1.56,BRUTUS,"Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them"
26248,26249,Coriolanus,28.0,3.1.57,BRUTUS,"Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness."
26249,26250,Coriolanus,29.0,3.1.58,CORIOLANUS,"Why, this was known before."
26250,26251,Coriolanus,30.0,3.1.59,BRUTUS,Not to them all.
26251,26252,Coriolanus,31.0,3.1.60,CORIOLANUS,Have you inform'd them sithence?
26252,26253,Coriolanus,32.0,3.1.61,BRUTUS,How! I inform them!
26253,26254,Coriolanus,33.0,3.1.62,CORIOLANUS,You are like to do such business.
26254,26255,Coriolanus,34.0,3.1.63,BRUTUS,"Not unlike,"
26255,26256,Coriolanus,34.0,3.1.64,BRUTUS,"Each way, to better yours."
26256,26257,Coriolanus,35.0,3.1.65,CORIOLANUS,"Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,"
26257,26258,Coriolanus,35.0,3.1.66,CORIOLANUS,"Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me"
26258,26259,Coriolanus,35.0,3.1.67,CORIOLANUS,Your fellow tribune.
26259,26260,Coriolanus,36.0,3.1.68,SICINIUS,You show too much of that
26260,26261,Coriolanus,36.0,3.1.69,SICINIUS,For which the people stir: if you will pass
26261,26262,Coriolanus,36.0,3.1.70,SICINIUS,"To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,"
26262,26263,Coriolanus,36.0,3.1.71,SICINIUS,"Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,"
26263,26264,Coriolanus,36.0,3.1.72,SICINIUS,"Or never be so noble as a consul,"
26264,26265,Coriolanus,36.0,3.1.73,SICINIUS,Nor yoke with him for tribune.
26265,26266,Coriolanus,37.0,3.1.74,MENENIUS,Let's be calm.
26266,26267,Coriolanus,38.0,3.1.75,COMINIUS,"The people are abused, set on. This paltering"
26267,26268,Coriolanus,38.0,3.1.76,COMINIUS,"Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus"
26268,26269,Coriolanus,38.0,3.1.77,COMINIUS,"Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely"
26269,26270,Coriolanus,38.0,3.1.78,COMINIUS,I' the plain way of his merit.
26270,26271,Coriolanus,39.0,3.1.79,CORIOLANUS,Tell me of corn!
26271,26272,Coriolanus,39.0,3.1.80,CORIOLANUS,"This was my speech, and I will speak't again--"
26272,26273,Coriolanus,40.0,3.1.81,MENENIUS,"Not now, not now."
26273,26274,Coriolanus,41.0,3.1.82,First Senator,"Not in this heat, sir, now."
26274,26275,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.83,CORIOLANUS,"Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,"
26275,26276,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.84,CORIOLANUS,I crave their pardons:
26276,26277,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.85,CORIOLANUS,"For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them"
26277,26278,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.86,CORIOLANUS,"Regard me as I do not flatter, and"
26278,26279,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.87,CORIOLANUS,"Therein behold themselves: I say again,"
26279,26280,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.88,CORIOLANUS,"In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate"
26280,26281,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.89,CORIOLANUS,"The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,"
26281,26282,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.90,CORIOLANUS,"Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,"
26282,26283,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.91,CORIOLANUS,"and scatter'd,"
26283,26284,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.92,CORIOLANUS,"By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,"
26284,26285,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.93,CORIOLANUS,"Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that"
26285,26286,Coriolanus,42.0,3.1.94,CORIOLANUS,Which they have given to beggars.
26286,26287,Coriolanus,43.0,3.1.95,MENENIUS,"Well, no more."
26287,26288,Coriolanus,44.0,3.1.96,First Senator,"No more words, we beseech you."
26288,26289,Coriolanus,45.0,3.1.97,CORIOLANUS,How! no more!
26289,26290,Coriolanus,45.0,3.1.98,CORIOLANUS,"As for my country I have shed my blood,"
26290,26291,Coriolanus,45.0,3.1.99,CORIOLANUS,"Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs"
26291,26292,Coriolanus,45.0,3.1.100,CORIOLANUS,"Coin words till their decay against those measles,"
26292,26293,Coriolanus,45.0,3.1.101,CORIOLANUS,"Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought"
26293,26294,Coriolanus,45.0,3.1.102,CORIOLANUS,The very way to catch them.
26294,26295,Coriolanus,46.0,3.1.103,BRUTUS,"You speak o' the people,"
26295,26296,Coriolanus,46.0,3.1.104,BRUTUS,"As if you were a god to punish, not"
26296,26297,Coriolanus,46.0,3.1.105,BRUTUS,A man of their infirmity.
26297,26298,Coriolanus,47.0,3.1.106,SICINIUS,'Twere well
26298,26299,Coriolanus,47.0,3.1.107,SICINIUS,We let the people know't.

26300,26301,Coriolanus,49.0,3.1.109,CORIOLANUS,Choler!
26301,26302,Coriolanus,49.0,3.1.110,CORIOLANUS,"Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,"
26302,26303,Coriolanus,49.0,3.1.111,CORIOLANUS,"By Jove, 'twould be my mind!"
26303,26304,Coriolanus,50.0,3.1.112,SICINIUS,It is a mind
26304,26305,Coriolanus,50.0,3.1.113,SICINIUS,"That shall remain a poison where it is,"
26305,26306,Coriolanus,50.0,3.1.114,SICINIUS,Not poison any further.
26306,26307,Coriolanus,51.0,3.1.115,CORIOLANUS,Shall remain!
26307,26308,Coriolanus,51.0,3.1.116,CORIOLANUS,Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
26308,26309,Coriolanus,51.0,3.1.117,CORIOLANUS,His absolute 'shall'?
26309,26310,Coriolanus,52.0,3.1.118,COMINIUS,'Twas from the canon.

26312,26313,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.121,CORIOLANUS,"You grave but reckless senators, have you thus"
26313,26314,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.122,CORIOLANUS,"Given Hydra here to choose an officer,"
26314,26315,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.123,CORIOLANUS,"That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but"
26315,26316,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.124,CORIOLANUS,"The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit"
26316,26317,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.125,CORIOLANUS,"To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,"
26317,26318,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.126,CORIOLANUS,And make your channel his? If he have power
26318,26319,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.127,CORIOLANUS,"Then vail your ignorance, if none, awake"
26319,26320,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.128,CORIOLANUS,"Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,"

26323,26324,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.132,CORIOLANUS,"When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste"
26324,26325,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.133,CORIOLANUS,"Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,"
26325,26326,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.134,CORIOLANUS,"And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'"

26327,26328,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.136,CORIOLANUS,Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!

26330,26331,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.139,CORIOLANUS,"Neither supreme, how soon confusion"
26331,26332,Coriolanus,53.0,3.1.140,CORIOLANUS,May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take

26340,26341,Coriolanus,57.0,3.1.149,CORIOLANUS,The ruin of the state.
26341,26342,Coriolanus,58.0,3.1.150,BRUTUS,"Why, shall the people give"
26342,26343,Coriolanus,58.0,3.1.151,BRUTUS,One that speaks thus their voice?
26343,26344,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.152,CORIOLANUS,"I'll give my reasons,"
26344,26345,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.153,CORIOLANUS,More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
26345,26346,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.154,CORIOLANUS,"Was not our recompense, resting well assured"
26346,26347,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.155,CORIOLANUS,"That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,"
26347,26348,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.156,CORIOLANUS,"Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,"
26348,26349,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.157,CORIOLANUS,They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
26349,26350,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.158,CORIOLANUS,Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
26350,26351,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.159,CORIOLANUS,"Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd"
26351,26352,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.160,CORIOLANUS,"Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation"
26352,26353,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.161,CORIOLANUS,"Which they have often made against the senate,"

26355,26356,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.164,CORIOLANUS,How shall this bisson multitude digest
26356,26357,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.165,CORIOLANUS,The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
26357,26358,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.166,CORIOLANUS,"What's like to be their words: 'we did request it,"
26358,26359,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.167,CORIOLANUS,"We are the greater poll, and in true fear"
26359,26360,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.168,CORIOLANUS,They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase

26362,26363,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.171,CORIOLANUS,Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
26363,26364,Coriolanus,59.0,3.1.172,CORIOLANUS,The crows to peck the eagles.
26364,26365,Coriolanus,60.0,3.1.173,MENENIUS,"Come, enough."
26365,26366,Coriolanus,61.0,3.1.174,BRUTUS,"Enough, with over-measure."

26377,26378,Coriolanus,62.0,3.1.186,CORIOLANUS,"You that will be less fearful than discreet,"
26378,26379,Coriolanus,62.0,3.1.187,CORIOLANUS,That love the fundamental part of state
26379,26380,Coriolanus,62.0,3.1.188,CORIOLANUS,"More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer"

26387,26388,Coriolanus,62.0,3.1.196,CORIOLANUS,"Not having the power to do the good it would,"

26389,26390,Coriolanus,63.0,3.1.198,BRUTUS,Has said enough.

26417,26418,Coriolanus,73.0,3.1.223,SICINIUS,"Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles"
26418,26419,Coriolanus,74.0,3.1.224,MENENIUS,On both sides more respect.
26419,26420,Coriolanus,75.0,3.1.225,SICINIUS,Here's he that would take from you all your power.
26420,26421,Coriolanus,76.0,3.1.226,BRUTUS,"Seize him, AEdiles!"
26421,26422,Coriolanus,77.0,3.1.227,Citizens,Down with him! down with him!
26422,26423,Coriolanus,77.0,3.1.228,Citizens,"Senators,  and C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!"
26423,26424,Coriolanus,77.0,,Citizens,"They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying"
26424,26425,Coriolanus,77.0,3.1.229,Citizens,"'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'"
26425,26426,Coriolanus,77.0,3.1.230,Citizens,'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
26426,26427,Coriolanus,77.0,3.1.231,Citizens,"'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'"
26427,26428,Coriolanus,78.0,3.1.232,MENENIUS,"What is about to be? I am out of breath,"
26428,26429,Coriolanus,78.0,3.1.233,MENENIUS,"Confusion's near, I cannot speak. You, tribunes"
26429,26430,Coriolanus,78.0,3.1.234,MENENIUS,"To the people! Coriolanus, patience!"
26430,26431,Coriolanus,78.0,3.1.235,MENENIUS,"Speak, good Sicinius."
26431,26432,Coriolanus,79.0,3.1.236,SICINIUS,"Hear me, people, peace!"
26432,26433,Coriolanus,80.0,3.1.237,Citizens,"Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak."
26433,26434,Coriolanus,81.0,3.1.238,SICINIUS,You are at point to lose your liberties:
26434,26435,Coriolanus,81.0,3.1.239,SICINIUS,"Marcius would have all from you, Marcius,"
26435,26436,Coriolanus,81.0,3.1.240,SICINIUS,Whom late you have named for consul.
26436,26437,Coriolanus,82.0,3.1.241,MENENIUS,"Fie, fie, fie!"
26437,26438,Coriolanus,82.0,3.1.242,MENENIUS,"This is the way to kindle, not to quench."
26438,26439,Coriolanus,83.0,3.1.243,First Senator,To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
26439,26440,Coriolanus,84.0,3.1.244,SICINIUS,What is the city but the people?
26440,26441,Coriolanus,85.0,3.1.245,Citizens,"True,"
26441,26442,Coriolanus,85.0,3.1.246,Citizens,The people are the city.
26442,26443,Coriolanus,86.0,3.1.247,BRUTUS,"By the consent of all, we were establish'd"
26443,26444,Coriolanus,86.0,3.1.248,BRUTUS,The people's magistrates.
26444,26445,Coriolanus,87.0,3.1.249,Citizens,You so remain.
26445,26446,Coriolanus,88.0,3.1.250,MENENIUS,And so are like to do.
26446,26447,Coriolanus,89.0,3.1.251,COMINIUS,"That is the way to lay the city flat,"
26447,26448,Coriolanus,89.0,3.1.252,COMINIUS,"To bring the roof to the foundation,"
26448,26449,Coriolanus,89.0,3.1.253,COMINIUS,"And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,"
26449,26450,Coriolanus,89.0,3.1.254,COMINIUS,In heaps and piles of ruin.
26450,26451,Coriolanus,90.0,3.1.255,SICINIUS,This deserves death.
26451,26452,Coriolanus,91.0,3.1.256,BRUTUS,"Or let us stand to our authority,"
26452,26453,Coriolanus,91.0,3.1.257,BRUTUS,"Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,"
26453,26454,Coriolanus,91.0,3.1.258,BRUTUS,"Upon the part o' the people, in whose power"
26454,26455,Coriolanus,91.0,3.1.259,BRUTUS,"We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy"
26455,26456,Coriolanus,91.0,3.1.260,BRUTUS,Of present death.
26456,26457,Coriolanus,92.0,3.1.261,SICINIUS,"Therefore lay hold of him,"
26457,26458,Coriolanus,92.0,3.1.262,SICINIUS,"Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence"
26458,26459,Coriolanus,92.0,3.1.263,SICINIUS,Into destruction cast him.
26459,26460,Coriolanus,93.0,3.1.264,BRUTUS,"AEdiles, seize him!"
26460,26461,Coriolanus,94.0,3.1.265,Citizens,"Yield, Marcius, yield!"
26461,26462,Coriolanus,95.0,3.1.266,MENENIUS,"Hear me one word,"
26462,26463,Coriolanus,95.0,3.1.267,MENENIUS,"Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word."
26463,26464,Coriolanus,96.0,3.1.268,AEdile,"Peace, peace!"
26464,26465,Coriolanus,97.0,3.1.269,MENENIUS,"[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly your"

26466,26467,Coriolanus,97.0,3.1.271,MENENIUS,And temperately proceed to what you would
26467,26468,Coriolanus,97.0,3.1.272,MENENIUS,Thus violently redress.
26468,26469,Coriolanus,98.0,3.1.273,BRUTUS,"Sir, those cold ways,"
26469,26470,Coriolanus,98.0,3.1.274,BRUTUS,"That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous"
26470,26471,Coriolanus,98.0,3.1.275,BRUTUS,"Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,"
26471,26472,Coriolanus,98.0,3.1.276,BRUTUS,And bear him to the rock.
26472,26473,Coriolanus,99.0,3.1.277,CORIOLANUS,"No, I'll die here."
26473,26474,Coriolanus,99.0,,CORIOLANUS,Drawing his sword
26474,26475,Coriolanus,99.0,3.1.278,CORIOLANUS,There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
26475,26476,Coriolanus,99.0,3.1.279,CORIOLANUS,"Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me."
26476,26477,Coriolanus,100.0,3.1.280,MENENIUS,"Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile."
26477,26478,Coriolanus,101.0,3.1.281,BRUTUS,Lay hands upon him.
26478,26479,Coriolanus,102.0,3.1.282,COMINIUS,"Help Marcius, help,"
26479,26480,Coriolanus,102.0,3.1.283,COMINIUS,"You that be noble, help him, young and old!"
26480,26481,Coriolanus,103.0,3.1.284,Citizens,"Down with him, down with him!"
26481,26482,Coriolanus,103.0,,Citizens,"In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the People, are beat in"
26482,26483,Coriolanus,104.0,3.1.285,MENENIUS,"Go, get you to your house, be gone, away!"
26483,26484,Coriolanus,104.0,3.1.286,MENENIUS,All will be naught else.
26484,26485,Coriolanus,105.0,3.1.287,Second Senator,Get you gone.
26485,26486,Coriolanus,106.0,3.1.288,COMINIUS,"Stand fast,"
26486,26487,Coriolanus,106.0,3.1.289,COMINIUS,We have as many friends as enemies.
26487,26488,Coriolanus,107.0,3.1.290,MENENIUS,Sham it be put to that?
26488,26489,Coriolanus,108.0,3.1.291,First Senator,The gods forbid!
26489,26490,Coriolanus,108.0,3.1.292,First Senator,"I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house,"
26490,26491,Coriolanus,108.0,3.1.293,First Senator,Leave us to cure this cause.
26491,26492,Coriolanus,109.0,3.1.294,MENENIUS,"For 'tis a sore upon us,"
26492,26493,Coriolanus,109.0,3.1.295,MENENIUS,"You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you."
26493,26494,Coriolanus,110.0,3.1.296,COMINIUS,"Come, sir, along with us."
26494,26495,Coriolanus,111.0,3.1.297,CORIOLANUS,"I would they were barbarians--as they are,"
26495,26496,Coriolanus,111.0,3.1.298,CORIOLANUS,"Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,"
26496,26497,Coriolanus,111.0,3.1.299,CORIOLANUS,Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
26497,26498,Coriolanus,112.0,3.1.300,MENENIUS,"Be gone,"
26498,26499,Coriolanus,112.0,3.1.301,MENENIUS,"Put not your worthy rage into your tongue,"
26499,26500,Coriolanus,112.0,3.1.302,MENENIUS,One time will owe another.
26500,26501,Coriolanus,113.0,3.1.303,CORIOLANUS,On fair ground
26501,26502,Coriolanus,113.0,3.1.304,CORIOLANUS,I could beat forty of them.
26502,26503,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.305,COMINIUS,I could myself
26503,26504,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.306,COMINIUS,"Take up a brace o' the best of them, yea, the"
26504,26505,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.307,COMINIUS,two tribunes:
26505,26506,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.308,COMINIUS,"But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic,"
26506,26507,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.309,COMINIUS,"And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands"
26507,26508,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.310,COMINIUS,"Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,"
26508,26509,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.311,COMINIUS,Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
26509,26510,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.312,COMINIUS,Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
26510,26511,Coriolanus,114.0,3.1.313,COMINIUS,What they are used to bear.
26511,26512,Coriolanus,115.0,3.1.314,MENENIUS,"Pray you, be gone:"
26512,26513,Coriolanus,115.0,3.1.315,MENENIUS,I'll try whether my old wit be in request
26513,26514,Coriolanus,115.0,3.1.316,MENENIUS,With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
26514,26515,Coriolanus,115.0,3.1.317,MENENIUS,With cloth of any colour.
26515,26516,Coriolanus,116.0,3.1.318,COMINIUS,"Nay, come away."
26516,26517,Coriolanus,116.0,,COMINIUS,"Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others"
26517,26518,Coriolanus,117.0,3.1.319,A Patrician,This man has marr'd his fortune.
26518,26519,Coriolanus,118.0,3.1.320,MENENIUS,His nature is too noble for the world:
26519,26520,Coriolanus,118.0,3.1.321,MENENIUS,"He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,"
26520,26521,Coriolanus,118.0,3.1.322,MENENIUS,Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
26521,26522,Coriolanus,118.0,3.1.323,MENENIUS,"What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,"
26522,26523,Coriolanus,118.0,3.1.324,MENENIUS,"And, being angry, does forget that ever"
26523,26524,Coriolanus,118.0,3.1.325,MENENIUS,He heard the name of death.
26524,26525,Coriolanus,118.0,,MENENIUS,A noise within
26525,26526,Coriolanus,118.0,3.1.326,MENENIUS,Here's goodly work!
26526,26527,Coriolanus,119.0,3.1.327,Second Patrician,I would they were abed!
26527,26528,Coriolanus,120.0,3.1.328,MENENIUS,I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
26528,26529,Coriolanus,120.0,3.1.329,MENENIUS,Could he not speak 'em fair?
26529,26530,Coriolanus,120.0,,MENENIUS,"Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble"
26530,26531,Coriolanus,121.0,3.1.330,SICINIUS,Where is this viper
26531,26532,Coriolanus,121.0,3.1.331,SICINIUS,That would depopulate the city and
26532,26533,Coriolanus,121.0,3.1.332,SICINIUS,Be every man himself?
26533,26534,Coriolanus,122.0,3.1.333,MENENIUS,"You worthy tribunes,--"
26534,26535,Coriolanus,123.0,3.1.334,SICINIUS,He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
26535,26536,Coriolanus,123.0,3.1.335,SICINIUS,"With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,"
26536,26537,Coriolanus,123.0,3.1.336,SICINIUS,And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
26537,26538,Coriolanus,123.0,3.1.337,SICINIUS,Than the severity of the public power
26538,26539,Coriolanus,123.0,3.1.338,SICINIUS,Which he so sets at nought.
26539,26540,Coriolanus,124.0,3.1.339,First Citizen,He shall well know
26540,26541,Coriolanus,124.0,3.1.340,First Citizen,"The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,"
26541,26542,Coriolanus,124.0,3.1.341,First Citizen,And we their hands.
26542,26543,Coriolanus,125.0,3.1.342,Citizens,"He shall, sure on't."
26543,26544,Coriolanus,126.0,3.1.343,MENENIUS,"Sir, sir,--"
26544,26545,Coriolanus,127.0,3.1.344,SICINIUS,Peace!
26545,26546,Coriolanus,128.0,3.1.345,MENENIUS,"Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt"
26546,26547,Coriolanus,128.0,3.1.346,MENENIUS,With modest warrant.
26547,26548,Coriolanus,129.0,3.1.347,SICINIUS,"Sir, how comes't that you"
26548,26549,Coriolanus,129.0,3.1.348,SICINIUS,Have holp to make this rescue?
26549,26550,Coriolanus,130.0,3.1.349,MENENIUS,Hear me speak:
26550,26551,Coriolanus,130.0,3.1.350,MENENIUS,"As I do know the consul's worthiness,"
26551,26552,Coriolanus,130.0,3.1.351,MENENIUS,"So can I name his faults,--"
26552,26553,Coriolanus,131.0,3.1.352,SICINIUS,Consul! what consul?
26553,26554,Coriolanus,132.0,3.1.353,MENENIUS,The consul Coriolanus.
26554,26555,Coriolanus,133.0,3.1.354,BRUTUS,He consul!
26555,26556,Coriolanus,134.0,3.1.355,Citizens,"No, no, no, no, no."
26556,26557,Coriolanus,135.0,3.1.356,MENENIUS,"If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,"
26557,26558,Coriolanus,135.0,3.1.357,MENENIUS,"I may be heard, I would crave a word or two,"
26558,26559,Coriolanus,135.0,3.1.358,MENENIUS,The which shall turn you to no further harm
26559,26560,Coriolanus,135.0,3.1.359,MENENIUS,Than so much loss of time.
26560,26561,Coriolanus,136.0,3.1.360,SICINIUS,"Speak briefly then,"
26561,26562,Coriolanus,136.0,3.1.361,SICINIUS,For we are peremptory to dispatch
26562,26563,Coriolanus,136.0,3.1.362,SICINIUS,This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
26563,26564,Coriolanus,136.0,3.1.363,SICINIUS,"Were but one danger, and to keep him here"
26564,26565,Coriolanus,136.0,3.1.364,SICINIUS,Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
26565,26566,Coriolanus,136.0,3.1.365,SICINIUS,He dies to-night.
26566,26567,Coriolanus,137.0,3.1.366,MENENIUS,Now the good gods forbid
26567,26568,Coriolanus,137.0,3.1.367,MENENIUS,"That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude"
26568,26569,Coriolanus,137.0,3.1.368,MENENIUS,Towards her deserved children is enroll'd

26571,26572,Coriolanus,138.0,3.1.371,SICINIUS,He's a disease that must be cut away.
26572,26573,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.372,MENENIUS,"O, he's a limb that has but a disease,"
26573,26574,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.373,MENENIUS,"Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy."
26574,26575,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.374,MENENIUS,What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
26575,26576,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.375,MENENIUS,"Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--"
26576,26577,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.376,MENENIUS,"Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,"
26577,26578,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.377,MENENIUS,"By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country,"
26578,26579,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.378,MENENIUS,"And what is left, to lose it by his country,"
26579,26580,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.379,MENENIUS,"Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,"
26580,26581,Coriolanus,139.0,3.1.380,MENENIUS,A brand to the end o' the world.
26581,26582,Coriolanus,140.0,3.1.381,SICINIUS,This is clean kam.
26582,26583,Coriolanus,141.0,3.1.382,BRUTUS,"Merely awry: when he did love his country,"
26583,26584,Coriolanus,141.0,3.1.383,BRUTUS,It honour'd him.
26584,26585,Coriolanus,142.0,3.1.384,MENENIUS,The service of the foot
26585,26586,Coriolanus,142.0,3.1.385,MENENIUS,"Being once gangrened, is not then respected"
26586,26587,Coriolanus,142.0,3.1.386,MENENIUS,For what before it was.
26587,26588,Coriolanus,143.0,3.1.387,BRUTUS,We'll hear no more.
26588,26589,Coriolanus,143.0,3.1.388,BRUTUS,"Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:"
26589,26590,Coriolanus,143.0,3.1.389,BRUTUS,"Lest his infection, being of catching nature,"
26590,26591,Coriolanus,143.0,3.1.390,BRUTUS,Spread further.
26591,26592,Coriolanus,144.0,3.1.391,MENENIUS,"One word more, one word."
26592,26593,Coriolanus,144.0,3.1.392,MENENIUS,"This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find"
26593,26594,Coriolanus,144.0,3.1.393,MENENIUS,"The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late"
26594,26595,Coriolanus,144.0,3.1.394,MENENIUS,"Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process,"
26595,26596,Coriolanus,144.0,3.1.395,MENENIUS,"Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,"
26596,26597,Coriolanus,144.0,3.1.396,MENENIUS,And sack great Rome with Romans.
26597,26598,Coriolanus,145.0,3.1.397,BRUTUS,"If it were so,--"
26598,26599,Coriolanus,146.0,3.1.398,SICINIUS,What do ye talk?
26599,26600,Coriolanus,146.0,3.1.399,SICINIUS,Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
26600,26601,Coriolanus,146.0,3.1.400,SICINIUS,Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
26601,26602,Coriolanus,147.0,3.1.401,MENENIUS,Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
26602,26603,Coriolanus,147.0,3.1.402,MENENIUS,"Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd"
26603,26604,Coriolanus,147.0,3.1.403,MENENIUS,"In bolted language, meal and bran together"
26604,26605,Coriolanus,147.0,3.1.404,MENENIUS,"He throws without distinction. Give me leave,"
26605,26606,Coriolanus,147.0,3.1.405,MENENIUS,"I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him"
26606,26607,Coriolanus,147.0,3.1.406,MENENIUS,"Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,"
26607,26608,Coriolanus,147.0,3.1.407,MENENIUS,"In peace, to his utmost peril."
26608,26609,Coriolanus,148.0,3.1.408,First Senator,"Noble tribunes,"
26609,26610,Coriolanus,148.0,3.1.409,First Senator,It is the humane way: the other course
26610,26611,Coriolanus,148.0,3.1.410,First Senator,"Will prove too bloody, and the end of it"
26611,26612,Coriolanus,148.0,3.1.411,First Senator,Unknown to the beginning.
26612,26613,Coriolanus,149.0,3.1.412,SICINIUS,"Noble Menenius,"
26613,26614,Coriolanus,149.0,3.1.413,SICINIUS,Be you then as the people's officer.
26614,26615,Coriolanus,149.0,3.1.414,SICINIUS,"Masters, lay down your weapons."
26615,26616,Coriolanus,150.0,3.1.415,BRUTUS,Go not home.
26616,26617,Coriolanus,151.0,3.1.416,SICINIUS,Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
26617,26618,Coriolanus,151.0,3.1.417,SICINIUS,"Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed"
26618,26619,Coriolanus,151.0,3.1.418,SICINIUS,In our first way.
26619,26620,Coriolanus,152.0,3.1.419,MENENIUS,I'll bring him to you.
26620,26621,Coriolanus,152.0,,MENENIUS,To the Senators
26621,26622,Coriolanus,152.0,3.1.420,MENENIUS,"Let me desire your company: he must come,"
26622,26623,Coriolanus,152.0,3.1.421,MENENIUS,Or what is worst will follow.
26623,26624,Coriolanus,153.0,3.1.422,First Senator,"Pray you, let's to him."
26624,26625,Coriolanus,153.0,,First Senator,Exeunt
26625,26626,Coriolanus,153.0,,First Senator,SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.
26626,26627,Coriolanus,153.0,,First Senator,Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians
26627,26628,Coriolanus,1.0,3.2.1,CORIOLANUS,"Let them puff all about mine ears, present me"
26628,26629,Coriolanus,1.0,3.2.2,CORIOLANUS,"Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,"
26629,26630,Coriolanus,1.0,3.2.3,CORIOLANUS,"Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,"
26630,26631,Coriolanus,1.0,3.2.4,CORIOLANUS,That the precipitation might down stretch
26631,26632,Coriolanus,1.0,3.2.5,CORIOLANUS,"Below the beam of sight, yet will I still"
26632,26633,Coriolanus,1.0,3.2.6,CORIOLANUS,Be thus to them.
26633,26634,Coriolanus,2.0,3.2.7,A Patrician,You do the nobler.
26634,26635,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.8,CORIOLANUS,I muse my mother
26635,26636,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.9,CORIOLANUS,"Does not approve me further, who was wont"
26636,26637,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.10,CORIOLANUS,"To call them woollen vassals, things created"
26637,26638,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.11,CORIOLANUS,"To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads"
26638,26639,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.12,CORIOLANUS,"In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,"
26639,26640,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.13,CORIOLANUS,When one but of my ordinance stood up
26640,26641,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.14,CORIOLANUS,To speak of peace or war.
26641,26642,Coriolanus,3.0,,CORIOLANUS,Enter VOLUMNIA
26642,26643,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.15,CORIOLANUS,I talk of you:
26643,26644,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.16,CORIOLANUS,Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
26644,26645,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.17,CORIOLANUS,False to my nature? Rather say I play
26645,26646,Coriolanus,3.0,3.2.18,CORIOLANUS,The man I am.
26646,26647,Coriolanus,4.0,3.2.19,VOLUMNIA,"O, sir, sir, sir,"
26647,26648,Coriolanus,4.0,3.2.20,VOLUMNIA,"I would have had you put your power well on,"
26648,26649,Coriolanus,4.0,3.2.21,VOLUMNIA,Before you had worn it out.
26649,26650,Coriolanus,5.0,3.2.22,CORIOLANUS,Let go.
26650,26651,Coriolanus,6.0,3.2.23,VOLUMNIA,"You might have been enough the man you are,"
26651,26652,Coriolanus,6.0,3.2.24,VOLUMNIA,"With striving less to be so, lesser had been"
26652,26653,Coriolanus,6.0,3.2.25,VOLUMNIA,"The thwartings of your dispositions, if"
26653,26654,Coriolanus,6.0,3.2.26,VOLUMNIA,You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
26654,26655,Coriolanus,6.0,3.2.27,VOLUMNIA,Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
26655,26656,Coriolanus,7.0,3.2.28,CORIOLANUS,Let them hang.
26656,26657,Coriolanus,8.0,3.2.29,A Patrician,"Ay, and burn too."
26657,26658,Coriolanus,8.0,,A Patrician,Enter MENENIUS and Senators
26658,26659,Coriolanus,9.0,3.2.30,MENENIUS,"Come, come, you have been too rough, something"
26659,26660,Coriolanus,9.0,3.2.31,MENENIUS,"too rough,"
26660,26661,Coriolanus,9.0,3.2.32,MENENIUS,You must return and mend it.
26661,26662,Coriolanus,10.0,3.2.33,First Senator,"There's no remedy,"
26662,26663,Coriolanus,10.0,3.2.34,First Senator,"Unless, by not so doing, our good city"
26663,26664,Coriolanus,10.0,3.2.35,First Senator,"Cleave in the midst, and perish."
26664,26665,Coriolanus,11.0,3.2.36,VOLUMNIA,"Pray, be counsell'd:"
26665,26666,Coriolanus,11.0,3.2.37,VOLUMNIA,"I have a heart as little apt as yours,"
26666,26667,Coriolanus,11.0,3.2.38,VOLUMNIA,But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
26667,26668,Coriolanus,11.0,3.2.39,VOLUMNIA,To better vantage.
26668,26669,Coriolanus,12.0,3.2.40,MENENIUS,"Well said, noble woman?"
26669,26670,Coriolanus,12.0,3.2.41,MENENIUS,"Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that"
26670,26671,Coriolanus,12.0,3.2.42,MENENIUS,The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
26671,26672,Coriolanus,12.0,3.2.43,MENENIUS,"For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,"
26672,26673,Coriolanus,12.0,3.2.44,MENENIUS,Which I can scarcely bear.
26673,26674,Coriolanus,13.0,3.2.45,CORIOLANUS,What must I do?
26674,26675,Coriolanus,14.0,3.2.46,MENENIUS,Return to the tribunes.
26675,26676,Coriolanus,15.0,3.2.47,CORIOLANUS,"Well, what then? what then?"
26676,26677,Coriolanus,16.0,3.2.48,MENENIUS,Repent what you have spoke.
26677,26678,Coriolanus,17.0,3.2.49,CORIOLANUS,"For them! I cannot do it to the gods,"
26678,26679,Coriolanus,17.0,3.2.50,CORIOLANUS,Must I then do't to them?
26679,26680,Coriolanus,18.0,3.2.51,VOLUMNIA,"You are too absolute,"
26680,26681,Coriolanus,18.0,3.2.52,VOLUMNIA,"Though therein you can never be too noble,"
26681,26682,Coriolanus,18.0,3.2.53,VOLUMNIA,"But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,"
26682,26683,Coriolanus,18.0,3.2.54,VOLUMNIA,"Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,"
26683,26684,Coriolanus,18.0,3.2.55,VOLUMNIA,"I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,"
26684,26685,Coriolanus,18.0,3.2.56,VOLUMNIA,"In peace what each of them by the other lose,"
26685,26686,Coriolanus,18.0,3.2.57,VOLUMNIA,That they combine not there.
26686,26687,Coriolanus,19.0,3.2.58,CORIOLANUS,"Tush, tush!"
26687,26688,Coriolanus,20.0,3.2.59,MENENIUS,A good demand.
26688,26689,Coriolanus,21.0,3.2.60,VOLUMNIA,If it be honour in your wars to seem
26689,26690,Coriolanus,21.0,3.2.61,VOLUMNIA,"The same you are not, which, for your best ends,"
26690,26691,Coriolanus,21.0,3.2.62,VOLUMNIA,"You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,"
26691,26692,Coriolanus,21.0,3.2.63,VOLUMNIA,That it shall hold companionship in peace
26692,26693,Coriolanus,21.0,3.2.64,VOLUMNIA,"With honour, as in war, since that to both"
26693,26694,Coriolanus,21.0,3.2.65,VOLUMNIA,It stands in like request?
26694,26695,Coriolanus,22.0,3.2.66,CORIOLANUS,Why force you this?
26695,26696,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.67,VOLUMNIA,Because that now it lies you on to speak
26696,26697,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.68,VOLUMNIA,"To the people, not by your own instruction,"
26697,26698,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.69,VOLUMNIA,"Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,"
26698,26699,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.70,VOLUMNIA,But with such words that are but rooted in
26699,26700,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.71,VOLUMNIA,"Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables"
26700,26701,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.72,VOLUMNIA,Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
26701,26702,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.73,VOLUMNIA,"Now, this no more dishonours you at all"
26702,26703,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.74,VOLUMNIA,"Than to take in a town with gentle words,"
26703,26704,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.75,VOLUMNIA,Which else would put you to your fortune and
26704,26705,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.76,VOLUMNIA,The hazard of much blood.
26705,26706,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.77,VOLUMNIA,I would dissemble with my nature where
26706,26707,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.78,VOLUMNIA,My fortunes and my friends at stake required
26707,26708,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.79,VOLUMNIA,"I should do so in honour: I am in this,"
26708,26709,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.80,VOLUMNIA,"Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles,"
26709,26710,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.81,VOLUMNIA,And you will rather show our general louts
26710,26711,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.82,VOLUMNIA,"How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,"
26711,26712,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.83,VOLUMNIA,For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
26712,26713,Coriolanus,23.0,3.2.84,VOLUMNIA,Of what that want might ruin.
26713,26714,Coriolanus,24.0,3.2.85,MENENIUS,Noble lady!
26714,26715,Coriolanus,24.0,3.2.86,MENENIUS,"Come, go with us, speak fair: you may salve so,"
26715,26716,Coriolanus,24.0,3.2.87,MENENIUS,"Not what is dangerous present, but the loss"
26716,26717,Coriolanus,24.0,3.2.88,MENENIUS,Of what is past.
26717,26718,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.89,VOLUMNIA,"I prithee now, my son,"
26718,26719,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.90,VOLUMNIA,"Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand,"
26719,26720,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.91,VOLUMNIA,And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
26720,26721,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.92,VOLUMNIA,Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
26721,26722,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.93,VOLUMNIA,"Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant"
26722,26723,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.94,VOLUMNIA,"More learned than the ears--waving thy head,"
26723,26724,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.95,VOLUMNIA,"Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,"
26724,26725,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.96,VOLUMNIA,Now humble as the ripest mulberry
26725,26726,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.97,VOLUMNIA,"That will not hold the handling: or say to them,"
26726,26727,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.98,VOLUMNIA,"Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils"
26727,26728,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.99,VOLUMNIA,"Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,"
26728,26729,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.100,VOLUMNIA,"Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,"
26729,26730,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.101,VOLUMNIA,"In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame"
26730,26731,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.102,VOLUMNIA,"Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far"
26731,26732,Coriolanus,25.0,3.2.103,VOLUMNIA,As thou hast power and person.
26732,26733,Coriolanus,26.0,3.2.104,MENENIUS,"This but done,"
26733,26734,Coriolanus,26.0,3.2.105,MENENIUS,"Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours,"
26734,26735,Coriolanus,26.0,3.2.106,MENENIUS,"For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free"
26735,26736,Coriolanus,26.0,3.2.107,MENENIUS,As words to little purpose.
26736,26737,Coriolanus,27.0,3.2.108,VOLUMNIA,"Prithee now,"
26737,26738,Coriolanus,27.0,3.2.109,VOLUMNIA,"Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather"
26738,26739,Coriolanus,27.0,3.2.110,VOLUMNIA,Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
26739,26740,Coriolanus,27.0,3.2.111,VOLUMNIA,Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
26740,26741,Coriolanus,27.0,,VOLUMNIA,Enter COMINIUS
26741,26742,Coriolanus,28.0,3.2.112,COMINIUS,"I have been i' the market-place, and, sir,'tis fit"
26742,26743,Coriolanus,28.0,3.2.113,COMINIUS,"You make strong party, or defend yourself"
26743,26744,Coriolanus,28.0,3.2.114,COMINIUS,By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
26744,26745,Coriolanus,29.0,3.2.115,MENENIUS,Only fair speech.
26745,26746,Coriolanus,30.0,3.2.116,COMINIUS,"I think 'twill serve, if he"
26746,26747,Coriolanus,30.0,3.2.117,COMINIUS,Can thereto frame his spirit.
26747,26748,Coriolanus,31.0,3.2.118,VOLUMNIA,"He must, and will"
26748,26749,Coriolanus,31.0,3.2.119,VOLUMNIA,"Prithee now, say you will, and go about it."
26749,26750,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.120,CORIOLANUS,Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
26750,26751,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.121,CORIOLANUS,Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
26751,26752,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.122,CORIOLANUS,"A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:"
26752,26753,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.123,CORIOLANUS,"Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,"
26753,26754,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.124,CORIOLANUS,"This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it"
26754,26755,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.125,CORIOLANUS,And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
26755,26756,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.126,CORIOLANUS,You have put me now to such a part which never
26756,26757,Coriolanus,32.0,3.2.127,CORIOLANUS,I shall discharge to the life.
26757,26758,Coriolanus,33.0,3.2.128,COMINIUS,"Come, come, we'll prompt you."
26758,26759,Coriolanus,34.0,3.2.129,VOLUMNIA,"I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said"
26759,26760,Coriolanus,34.0,3.2.130,VOLUMNIA,"My praises made thee first a soldier, so,"
26760,26761,Coriolanus,34.0,3.2.131,VOLUMNIA,"To have my praise for this, perform a part"
26761,26762,Coriolanus,34.0,3.2.132,VOLUMNIA,Thou hast not done before.
26762,26763,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.133,CORIOLANUS,"Well, I must do't:"
26763,26764,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.134,CORIOLANUS,"Away, my disposition, and possess me"
26764,26765,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.135,CORIOLANUS,"Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,"
26765,26766,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.136,CORIOLANUS,"Which quired with my drum, into a pipe"
26766,26767,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.137,CORIOLANUS,"Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice"
26767,26768,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.138,CORIOLANUS,That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
26768,26769,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.139,CORIOLANUS,"Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up"
26769,26770,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.140,CORIOLANUS,The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
26770,26771,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.141,CORIOLANUS,"Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,"
26771,26772,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.142,CORIOLANUS,"Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his"
26772,26773,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.143,CORIOLANUS,"That hath received an alms! I will not do't,"
26773,26774,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.144,CORIOLANUS,Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
26774,26775,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.145,CORIOLANUS,And by my body's action teach my mind
26775,26776,Coriolanus,35.0,3.2.146,CORIOLANUS,A most inherent baseness.
26776,26777,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.147,VOLUMNIA,"At thy choice, then:"
26777,26778,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.148,VOLUMNIA,"To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour"
26778,26779,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.149,VOLUMNIA,"Than thou of them. Come all to ruin, let"
26779,26780,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.150,VOLUMNIA,Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
26780,26781,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.151,VOLUMNIA,"Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death"
26781,26782,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.152,VOLUMNIA,With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
26782,26783,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.153,VOLUMNIA,"Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,"
26783,26784,Coriolanus,36.0,3.2.154,VOLUMNIA,But owe thy pride thyself.

26785,26786,Coriolanus,37.0,3.2.156,CORIOLANUS,"Mother, I am going to the market-place,"
26786,26787,Coriolanus,37.0,3.2.157,CORIOLANUS,"Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,"
26787,26788,Coriolanus,37.0,3.2.158,CORIOLANUS,"Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved"
26788,26789,Coriolanus,37.0,3.2.159,CORIOLANUS,"Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:"
26789,26790,Coriolanus,37.0,3.2.160,CORIOLANUS,"Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul,"
26790,26791,Coriolanus,37.0,3.2.161,CORIOLANUS,Or never trust to what my tongue can do
26791,26792,Coriolanus,37.0,3.2.162,CORIOLANUS,I' the way of flattery further.
26792,26793,Coriolanus,38.0,3.2.163,VOLUMNIA,Do your will.
26793,26794,Coriolanus,38.0,,VOLUMNIA,Exit
26794,26795,Coriolanus,39.0,3.2.164,COMINIUS,Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
26795,26796,Coriolanus,39.0,3.2.165,COMINIUS,"To answer mildly, for they are prepared"
26796,26797,Coriolanus,39.0,3.2.166,COMINIUS,"With accusations, as I hear, more strong"
26797,26798,Coriolanus,39.0,3.2.167,COMINIUS,Than are upon you yet.
26798,26799,Coriolanus,40.0,3.2.168,CORIOLANUS,"The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:"
26799,26800,Coriolanus,40.0,3.2.169,CORIOLANUS,"Let them accuse me by invention, I"
26800,26801,Coriolanus,40.0,3.2.170,CORIOLANUS,Will answer in mine honour.
26801,26802,Coriolanus,41.0,3.2.171,MENENIUS,"Ay, but mildly."
26802,26803,Coriolanus,42.0,3.2.172,CORIOLANUS,"Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!"
26803,26804,Coriolanus,42.0,,CORIOLANUS,Exeunt
26804,26805,Coriolanus,42.0,,CORIOLANUS,SCENE III. The same. The Forum.
26805,26806,Coriolanus,42.0,,CORIOLANUS,Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
26806,26807,Coriolanus,1.0,3.3.1,BRUTUS,"In this point charge him home, that he affects"
26807,26808,Coriolanus,1.0,3.3.2,BRUTUS,"Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,"
26808,26809,Coriolanus,1.0,3.3.3,BRUTUS,"Enforce him with his envy to the people,"
26809,26810,Coriolanus,1.0,3.3.4,BRUTUS,And that the spoil got on the Antiates
26810,26811,Coriolanus,1.0,3.3.5,BRUTUS,Was ne'er distributed.
26811,26812,Coriolanus,1.0,,BRUTUS,Enter an AEdile
26812,26813,Coriolanus,1.0,3.3.6,BRUTUS,"What, will he come?"
26813,26814,Coriolanus,2.0,3.3.7,AEdile,He's coming.
26814,26815,Coriolanus,3.0,3.3.8,BRUTUS,How accompanied?
26815,26816,Coriolanus,4.0,3.3.9,AEdile,"With old Menenius, and those senators"
26816,26817,Coriolanus,4.0,3.3.10,AEdile,That always favour'd him.
26817,26818,Coriolanus,5.0,3.3.11,SICINIUS,Have you a catalogue
26818,26819,Coriolanus,5.0,3.3.12,SICINIUS,Of all the voices that we have procured
26819,26820,Coriolanus,5.0,3.3.13,SICINIUS,Set down by the poll?
26820,26821,Coriolanus,6.0,3.3.14,AEdile,"I have, 'tis ready."
26821,26822,Coriolanus,7.0,3.3.15,SICINIUS,Have you collected them by tribes?
26822,26823,Coriolanus,8.0,3.3.16,AEdile,I have.
26823,26824,Coriolanus,9.0,3.3.17,SICINIUS,"Assemble presently the people hither,"
26824,26825,Coriolanus,9.0,3.3.18,SICINIUS,And when they bear me say 'It shall be so

26826,26827,Coriolanus,9.0,3.3.20,SICINIUS,"For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them"

26828,26829,Coriolanus,9.0,3.3.22,SICINIUS,Insisting on the old prerogative
26829,26830,Coriolanus,9.0,3.3.23,SICINIUS,And power i' the truth o' the cause.
26830,26831,Coriolanus,10.0,3.3.24,AEdile,I shall inform them.
26831,26832,Coriolanus,11.0,3.3.25,BRUTUS,"And when such time they have begun to cry,"
26832,26833,Coriolanus,11.0,3.3.26,BRUTUS,"Let them not cease, but with a din confused"
26833,26834,Coriolanus,11.0,3.3.27,BRUTUS,Enforce the present execution
26834,26835,Coriolanus,11.0,3.3.28,BRUTUS,Of what we chance to sentence.
26835,26836,Coriolanus,12.0,3.3.29,AEdile,Very well.
26836,26837,Coriolanus,13.0,3.3.30,SICINIUS,"Make them be strong and ready for this hint,"
26837,26838,Coriolanus,13.0,3.3.31,SICINIUS,When we shall hap to give 't them.
26838,26839,Coriolanus,14.0,3.3.32,BRUTUS,Go about it.
26839,26840,Coriolanus,14.0,,BRUTUS,Exit AEdile
26840,26841,Coriolanus,14.0,3.3.33,BRUTUS,Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
26841,26842,Coriolanus,14.0,3.3.34,BRUTUS,"Ever to conquer, and to have his worth"
26842,26843,Coriolanus,14.0,3.3.35,BRUTUS,"Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot"
26843,26844,Coriolanus,14.0,3.3.36,BRUTUS,"Be rein'd again to temperance, then he speaks"
26844,26845,Coriolanus,14.0,3.3.37,BRUTUS,"What's in his heart, and that is there which looks"
26845,26846,Coriolanus,14.0,3.3.38,BRUTUS,With us to break his neck.
26846,26847,Coriolanus,15.0,3.3.39,SICINIUS,"Well, here he comes."
26847,26848,Coriolanus,15.0,,SICINIUS,"Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians"
26848,26849,Coriolanus,16.0,3.3.40,MENENIUS,"Calmly, I do beseech you."
26849,26850,Coriolanus,17.0,3.3.41,CORIOLANUS,"Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece"
26850,26851,Coriolanus,17.0,3.3.42,CORIOLANUS,Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
26851,26852,Coriolanus,17.0,3.3.43,CORIOLANUS,"Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice"
26852,26853,Coriolanus,17.0,3.3.44,CORIOLANUS,Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
26853,26854,Coriolanus,17.0,3.3.45,CORIOLANUS,"Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,"
26854,26855,Coriolanus,17.0,3.3.46,CORIOLANUS,And not our streets with war!
26855,26856,Coriolanus,18.0,3.3.47,First Senator,"Amen, amen."
26856,26857,Coriolanus,19.0,3.3.48,MENENIUS,A noble wish.
26857,26858,Coriolanus,19.0,,MENENIUS,"Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens"

26859,26860,Coriolanus,21.0,3.3.50,AEdile,"List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!"
26860,26861,Coriolanus,22.0,3.3.51,CORIOLANUS,"First, hear me speak."
26861,26862,Coriolanus,23.0,3.3.52,Both Tribunes,"Well, say. Peace, ho!"
26862,26863,Coriolanus,24.0,3.3.53,CORIOLANUS,Shall I be charged no further than this present?
26863,26864,Coriolanus,24.0,3.3.54,CORIOLANUS,Must all determine here?
26864,26865,Coriolanus,25.0,3.3.55,SICINIUS,"I do demand,"
26865,26866,Coriolanus,25.0,3.3.56,SICINIUS,"If you submit you to the people's voices,"
26866,26867,Coriolanus,25.0,3.3.57,SICINIUS,Allow their officers and are content
26867,26868,Coriolanus,25.0,3.3.58,SICINIUS,To suffer lawful censure for such faults
26868,26869,Coriolanus,25.0,3.3.59,SICINIUS,As shall be proved upon you?
26869,26870,Coriolanus,26.0,3.3.60,CORIOLANUS,I am content.
26870,26871,Coriolanus,27.0,3.3.61,MENENIUS,"Lo, citizens, he says he is content:"
26871,26872,Coriolanus,27.0,3.3.62,MENENIUS,"The warlike service he has done, consider, think"
26872,26873,Coriolanus,27.0,3.3.63,MENENIUS,"Upon the wounds his body bears, which show"
26873,26874,Coriolanus,27.0,3.3.64,MENENIUS,Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
26874,26875,Coriolanus,28.0,3.3.65,CORIOLANUS,"Scratches with briers,"
26875,26876,Coriolanus,28.0,3.3.66,CORIOLANUS,Scars to move laughter only.
26876,26877,Coriolanus,29.0,3.3.67,MENENIUS,"Consider further,"
26877,26878,Coriolanus,29.0,3.3.68,MENENIUS,"That when he speaks not like a citizen,"
26878,26879,Coriolanus,29.0,3.3.69,MENENIUS,You find him like a soldier: do not take
26879,26880,Coriolanus,29.0,3.3.70,MENENIUS,"His rougher accents for malicious sounds,"
26880,26881,Coriolanus,29.0,3.3.71,MENENIUS,"But, as I say, such as become a soldier,"
26881,26882,Coriolanus,29.0,3.3.72,MENENIUS,Rather than envy you.
26882,26883,Coriolanus,30.0,3.3.73,COMINIUS,"Well, well, no more."
26883,26884,Coriolanus,31.0,3.3.74,CORIOLANUS,What is the matter
26884,26885,Coriolanus,31.0,3.3.75,CORIOLANUS,"That being pass'd for consul with full voice,"
26885,26886,Coriolanus,31.0,3.3.76,CORIOLANUS,I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
26886,26887,Coriolanus,31.0,3.3.77,CORIOLANUS,You take it off again?
26887,26888,Coriolanus,32.0,3.3.78,SICINIUS,Answer to us.
26888,26889,Coriolanus,33.0,3.3.79,CORIOLANUS,"Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so."
26889,26890,Coriolanus,34.0,3.3.80,SICINIUS,"We charge you, that you have contrived to take"
26890,26891,Coriolanus,34.0,3.3.81,SICINIUS,From Rome all season'd office and to wind
26891,26892,Coriolanus,34.0,3.3.82,SICINIUS,"Yourself into a power tyrannical,"
26892,26893,Coriolanus,34.0,3.3.83,SICINIUS,For which you are a traitor to the people.
26893,26894,Coriolanus,35.0,3.3.84,CORIOLANUS,How! traitor!
26894,26895,Coriolanus,36.0,3.3.85,MENENIUS,"Nay, temperately, your promise."
26895,26896,Coriolanus,37.0,3.3.86,CORIOLANUS,The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
26896,26897,Coriolanus,37.0,3.3.87,CORIOLANUS,Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
26897,26898,Coriolanus,37.0,3.3.88,CORIOLANUS,"Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,"
26898,26899,Coriolanus,37.0,3.3.89,CORIOLANUS,"In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in"
26899,26900,Coriolanus,37.0,3.3.90,CORIOLANUS,"Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say"
26900,26901,Coriolanus,37.0,3.3.91,CORIOLANUS,'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
26901,26902,Coriolanus,37.0,3.3.92,CORIOLANUS,As I do pray the gods.
26902,26903,Coriolanus,38.0,3.3.93,SICINIUS,"Mark you this, people?"
26903,26904,Coriolanus,39.0,3.3.94,Citizens,"To the rock, to the rock with him!"
26904,26905,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.95,SICINIUS,Peace!
26905,26906,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.96,SICINIUS,We need not put new matter to his charge:
26906,26907,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.97,SICINIUS,"What you have seen him do and heard him speak,"
26907,26908,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.98,SICINIUS,"Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,"
26908,26909,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.99,SICINIUS,Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
26909,26910,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.100,SICINIUS,"Those whose great power must try him, even this,"
26910,26911,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.101,SICINIUS,"So criminal and in such capital kind,"
26911,26912,Coriolanus,40.0,3.3.102,SICINIUS,Deserves the extremest death.
26912,26913,Coriolanus,41.0,3.3.103,BRUTUS,But since he hath
26913,26914,Coriolanus,41.0,3.3.104,BRUTUS,"Served well for Rome,--"
26914,26915,Coriolanus,42.0,3.3.105,CORIOLANUS,What do you prate of service?
26915,26916,Coriolanus,43.0,3.3.106,BRUTUS,"I talk of that, that know it."
26916,26917,Coriolanus,44.0,3.3.107,CORIOLANUS,You?
26917,26918,Coriolanus,45.0,3.3.108,MENENIUS,Is this the promise that you made your mother?
26918,26919,Coriolanus,46.0,3.3.109,COMINIUS,"Know, I pray you,--"
26919,26920,Coriolanus,47.0,3.3.110,CORIOLANUS,I know no further:
26920,26921,Coriolanus,47.0,3.3.111,CORIOLANUS,"Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,"
26921,26922,Coriolanus,47.0,3.3.112,CORIOLANUS,"Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger"
26922,26923,Coriolanus,47.0,3.3.113,CORIOLANUS,"But with a grain a day, I would not buy"
26923,26924,Coriolanus,47.0,3.3.114,CORIOLANUS,"Their mercy at the price of one fair word,"
26924,26925,Coriolanus,47.0,3.3.115,CORIOLANUS,"Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,"
26925,26926,Coriolanus,47.0,3.3.116,CORIOLANUS,To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
26926,26927,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.117,SICINIUS,"For that he has,"
26927,26928,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.118,SICINIUS,"As much as in him lies, from time to time"
26928,26929,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.119,SICINIUS,"Envied against the people, seeking means"
26929,26930,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.120,SICINIUS,"To pluck away their power, as now at last"
26930,26931,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.121,SICINIUS,"Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence"

26933,26934,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.124,SICINIUS,"And in the power of us the tribunes, we,"
26934,26935,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.125,SICINIUS,"Even from this instant, banish him our city,"
26935,26936,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.126,SICINIUS,In peril of precipitation
26936,26937,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.127,SICINIUS,From off the rock Tarpeian never more
26937,26938,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.128,SICINIUS,"To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,"
26938,26939,Coriolanus,48.0,3.3.129,SICINIUS,I say it shall be so.
26939,26940,Coriolanus,49.0,3.3.130,Citizens,"It shall be so, it shall be so, let him away:"
26940,26941,Coriolanus,49.0,3.3.131,Citizens,"He's banish'd, and it shall be so."
26941,26942,Coriolanus,50.0,3.3.132,COMINIUS,"Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--"
26942,26943,Coriolanus,51.0,3.3.133,SICINIUS,"He's sentenced, no more hearing."

27305,27306,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.74,CORIOLANUS,"Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains,"
27306,27307,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.75,CORIOLANUS,"The cruelty and envy of the people,"
27307,27308,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.76,CORIOLANUS,"Permitted by our dastard nobles, who"
27308,27309,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.77,CORIOLANUS,"Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest,"
27309,27310,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.78,CORIOLANUS,And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
27310,27311,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.79,CORIOLANUS,Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
27311,27312,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.80,CORIOLANUS,"Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope--"
27312,27313,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.81,CORIOLANUS,"Mistake me not--to save my life, for if"
27313,27314,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.82,CORIOLANUS,"I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world"
27314,27315,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.83,CORIOLANUS,"I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,"
27315,27316,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.84,CORIOLANUS,"To be full quit of those my banishers,"
27316,27317,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.85,CORIOLANUS,Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
27317,27318,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.86,CORIOLANUS,"A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge"
27318,27319,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.87,CORIOLANUS,Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
27319,27320,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.88,CORIOLANUS,"Of shame seen through thy country, speed"
27320,27321,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.89,CORIOLANUS,"thee straight,"
27321,27322,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.90,CORIOLANUS,And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
27322,27323,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.91,CORIOLANUS,That my revengeful services may prove
27323,27324,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.92,CORIOLANUS,"As benefits to thee, for I will fight"
27324,27325,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.93,CORIOLANUS,Against my canker'd country with the spleen
27325,27326,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.94,CORIOLANUS,Of all the under fiends. But if so be
27326,27327,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.95,CORIOLANUS,Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
27327,27328,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.96,CORIOLANUS,"Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am"
27328,27329,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.97,CORIOLANUS,"Longer to live most weary, and present"
27329,27330,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.98,CORIOLANUS,"My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice,"
27330,27331,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.99,CORIOLANUS,"Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,"
27331,27332,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.100,CORIOLANUS,"Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,"
27332,27333,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.101,CORIOLANUS,"Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,"
27333,27334,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.102,CORIOLANUS,"And cannot live but to thy shame, unless"
27334,27335,Coriolanus,42.0,4.5.103,CORIOLANUS,It be to do thee service.
27335,27336,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.104,AUFIDIUS,"O Marcius, Marcius!"
27336,27337,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.105,AUFIDIUS,Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
27337,27338,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.106,AUFIDIUS,A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
27338,27339,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.107,AUFIDIUS,"Should from yond cloud speak divine things,"
27339,27340,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.108,AUFIDIUS,"And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more"
27340,27341,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.109,AUFIDIUS,"Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine"
27341,27342,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.110,AUFIDIUS,"Mine arms about that body, where against"
27342,27343,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.111,AUFIDIUS,My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
27343,27344,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.112,AUFIDIUS,And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
27344,27345,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.113,AUFIDIUS,"The anvil of my sword, and do contest"
27345,27346,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.114,AUFIDIUS,As hotly and as nobly with thy love
27346,27347,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.115,AUFIDIUS,As ever in ambitious strength I did
27347,27348,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.116,AUFIDIUS,"Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,"
27348,27349,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.117,AUFIDIUS,"I loved the maid I married, never man"
27349,27350,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.118,AUFIDIUS,"Sigh'd truer breath, but that I see thee here,"
27350,27351,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.119,AUFIDIUS,Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
27351,27352,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.120,AUFIDIUS,Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
27352,27353,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.121,AUFIDIUS,"Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,"
27353,27354,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.122,AUFIDIUS,"We have a power on foot, and I had purpose"
27354,27355,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.123,AUFIDIUS,"Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,"
27355,27356,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.124,AUFIDIUS,Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
27356,27357,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.125,AUFIDIUS,"Twelve several times, and I have nightly since"
27357,27358,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.126,AUFIDIUS,"Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me,"
27358,27359,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.127,AUFIDIUS,"We have been down together in my sleep,"
27359,27360,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.128,AUFIDIUS,"Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,"
27360,27361,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.129,AUFIDIUS,"And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,"
27361,27362,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.130,AUFIDIUS,"Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that"
27362,27363,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.131,AUFIDIUS,"Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all"
27363,27364,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.132,AUFIDIUS,"From twelve to seventy, and pouring war"
27364,27365,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.133,AUFIDIUS,"Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,"
27365,27366,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.134,AUFIDIUS,"Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,"
27366,27367,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.135,AUFIDIUS,"And take our friendly senators by the hands,"
27367,27368,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.136,AUFIDIUS,"Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,"
27368,27369,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.137,AUFIDIUS,"Who am prepared against your territories,"
27369,27370,Coriolanus,43.0,4.5.138,AUFIDIUS,Though not for Rome itself.
27370,27371,Coriolanus,44.0,4.5.139,CORIOLANUS,"You bless me, gods!"
27371,27372,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.140,AUFIDIUS,"Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have"
27372,27373,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.141,AUFIDIUS,"The leading of thine own revenges, take"
27373,27374,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.142,AUFIDIUS,"The one half of my commission, and set down--"
27374,27375,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.143,AUFIDIUS,"As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st"
27375,27376,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.144,AUFIDIUS,"Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways,"
27376,27377,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.145,AUFIDIUS,"Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,"
27377,27378,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.146,AUFIDIUS,"Or rudely visit them in parts remote,"
27378,27379,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.147,AUFIDIUS,"To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:"
27379,27380,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.148,AUFIDIUS,Let me commend thee first to those that shall
27380,27381,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.149,AUFIDIUS,Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
27381,27382,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.150,AUFIDIUS,"And more a friend than e'er an enemy,"
27382,27383,Coriolanus,45.0,4.5.151,AUFIDIUS,"Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!"
27383,27384,Coriolanus,45.0,,AUFIDIUS,Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward
27384,27385,Coriolanus,46.0,4.5.152,First Servingman,Here's a strange alteration!
27385,27386,Coriolanus,47.0,4.5.153,Second Servingman,"By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with"
27386,27387,Coriolanus,47.0,4.5.154,Second Servingman,"a cudgel, and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a"
27387,27388,Coriolanus,47.0,4.5.155,Second Servingman,false report of him.
27388,27389,Coriolanus,48.0,4.5.156,First Servingman,What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
27389,27390,Coriolanus,48.0,4.5.157,First Servingman,"finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top."
27390,27391,Coriolanus,49.0,4.5.158,Second Servingman,"Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in"
27391,27392,Coriolanus,49.0,4.5.159,Second Servingman,"him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I"
27392,27393,Coriolanus,49.0,4.5.160,Second Servingman,cannot tell how to term it.
27393,27394,Coriolanus,50.0,4.5.161,First Servingman,"He had so, looking as it were--would I were hanged,"
27394,27395,Coriolanus,50.0,4.5.162,First Servingman,but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
27395,27396,Coriolanus,51.0,4.5.163,Second Servingman,"So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest"
27396,27397,Coriolanus,51.0,4.5.164,Second Servingman,man i' the world.
27397,27398,Coriolanus,52.0,4.5.165,First Servingman,I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
27398,27399,Coriolanus,53.0,4.5.166,Second Servingman,"Who, my master?"
27399,27400,Coriolanus,54.0,4.5.167,First Servingman,"Nay, it's no matter for that."
27400,27401,Coriolanus,55.0,4.5.168,Second Servingman,Worth six on him.
27401,27402,Coriolanus,56.0,4.5.169,First Servingman,"Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the"
27402,27403,Coriolanus,56.0,4.5.170,First Servingman,greater soldier.
27403,27404,Coriolanus,57.0,4.5.171,Second Servingman,"Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:"
27404,27405,Coriolanus,57.0,4.5.172,Second Servingman,"for the defence of a town, our general is excellent."
27405,27406,Coriolanus,58.0,4.5.173,First Servingman,"Ay, and for an assault too."
27406,27407,Coriolanus,58.0,,First Servingman,Re-enter third Servingman
27407,27408,Coriolanus,59.0,4.5.174,Third Servingman,"O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!"
27408,27409,Coriolanus,61.0,4.5.175,Second Servingman,"What, what, what? let's partake."
27409,27410,Coriolanus,62.0,4.5.176,Third Servingman,"I would not be a Roman, of all nations, I had as"
27410,27411,Coriolanus,62.0,4.5.177,Third Servingman,lieve be a condemned man.
27411,27412,Coriolanus,64.0,4.5.178,Second Servingman,Wherefore? wherefore?
27412,27413,Coriolanus,65.0,4.5.179,Third Servingman,"Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,"
27413,27414,Coriolanus,65.0,4.5.180,Third Servingman,Caius Marcius.
27414,27415,Coriolanus,66.0,4.5.181,First Servingman,Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
27415,27416,Coriolanus,67.0,4.5.182,Third Servingman,"I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always"
27416,27417,Coriolanus,67.0,4.5.183,Third Servingman,good enough for him.
27417,27418,Coriolanus,68.0,4.5.184,Second Servingman,"Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too"
27418,27419,Coriolanus,68.0,4.5.185,Second Servingman,"hard for him, I have heard him say so himself."
27419,27420,Coriolanus,69.0,4.5.186,First Servingman,"He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth"
27420,27421,Coriolanus,69.0,4.5.187,First Servingman,on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
27421,27422,Coriolanus,69.0,4.5.188,First Servingman,him like a carbon ado.
27422,27423,Coriolanus,70.0,4.5.189,Second Servingman,"An he had been cannibally given, he might have"
27423,27424,Coriolanus,70.0,4.5.190,Second Servingman,broiled and eaten him too.
27424,27425,Coriolanus,71.0,4.5.191,First Servingman,"But, more of thy news?"
27425,27426,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.192,Third Servingman,"Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son"
27426,27427,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.193,Third Servingman,"and heir to Mars, set at upper end o' the table, no"
27427,27428,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.194,Third Servingman,"question asked him by any of the senators, but they"
27428,27429,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.195,Third Servingman,stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
27429,27430,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.196,Third Servingman,mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
27430,27431,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.197,Third Servingman,turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
27431,27432,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.198,Third Servingman,the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
27432,27433,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.199,Third Servingman,the middle and but one half of what he was
27433,27434,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.200,Third Servingman,"yesterday, for the other has half, by the entreaty"
27434,27435,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.201,Third Servingman,"and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,"
27435,27436,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.202,Third Servingman,and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
27436,27437,Coriolanus,72.0,4.5.203,Third Servingman,"will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled."
27437,27438,Coriolanus,73.0,4.5.204,Second Servingman,And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
27438,27439,Coriolanus,74.0,4.5.205,Third Servingman,"Do't! he will do't, for, look you, sir, he has as"
27439,27440,Coriolanus,74.0,4.5.206,Third Servingman,"many friends as enemies, which friends, sir, as it"
27440,27441,Coriolanus,74.0,4.5.207,Third Servingman,"were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as"
27441,27442,Coriolanus,74.0,4.5.208,Third Servingman,"we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude."
27442,27443,Coriolanus,75.0,4.5.209,First Servingman,Directitude! what's that?
27443,27444,Coriolanus,76.0,4.5.210,Third Servingman,"But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,"
27444,27445,Coriolanus,76.0,4.5.211,Third Servingman,"and the man in blood, they will out of their"
27445,27446,Coriolanus,76.0,4.5.212,Third Servingman,"burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with"
27446,27447,Coriolanus,76.0,4.5.213,Third Servingman,him.
27447,27448,Coriolanus,77.0,4.5.214,First Servingman,But when goes this forward?
27448,27449,Coriolanus,78.0,4.5.215,Third Servingman,"To-morrow, to-day, presently, you shall have the"
27449,27450,Coriolanus,78.0,4.5.216,Third Servingman,"drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a"
27450,27451,Coriolanus,78.0,4.5.217,Third Servingman,"parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they"
27451,27452,Coriolanus,78.0,4.5.218,Third Servingman,wipe their lips.
27452,27453,Coriolanus,79.0,4.5.219,Second Servingman,"Why, then we shall have a stirring world again."
27453,27454,Coriolanus,79.0,4.5.220,Second Servingman,"This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase"
27454,27455,Coriolanus,79.0,4.5.221,Second Servingman,"tailors, and breed ballad-makers."
27455,27456,Coriolanus,80.0,4.5.222,First Servingman,"Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as"
27456,27457,Coriolanus,80.0,4.5.223,First Servingman,"day does night, it's spritely, waking, audible, and"
27457,27458,Coriolanus,80.0,4.5.224,First Servingman,"full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy,"
27458,27459,Coriolanus,80.0,4.5.225,First Servingman,"mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more"
27459,27460,Coriolanus,80.0,4.5.226,First Servingman,bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
27460,27461,Coriolanus,81.0,4.5.227,Second Servingman,"'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to"
27461,27462,Coriolanus,81.0,4.5.228,Second Servingman,"be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a"
27462,27463,Coriolanus,81.0,4.5.229,Second Servingman,great maker of cuckolds.
27463,27464,Coriolanus,82.0,4.5.230,First Servingman,"Ay, and it makes men hate one another."
27464,27465,Coriolanus,83.0,4.5.231,Third Servingman,"Reason, because they then less need one another."
27465,27466,Coriolanus,83.0,4.5.232,Third Servingman,The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
27466,27467,Coriolanus,83.0,4.5.233,Third Servingman,"as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising."
27467,27468,Coriolanus,84.0,4.5.234,All,"In, in, in, in!"

27473,27474,Coriolanus,1.0,4.6.3,SICINIUS,"And quietness of the people, which before"
27474,27475,Coriolanus,1.0,4.6.4,SICINIUS,Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
27475,27476,Coriolanus,1.0,4.6.5,SICINIUS,"Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,"
27476,27477,Coriolanus,1.0,4.6.6,SICINIUS,"Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold"
27477,27478,Coriolanus,1.0,4.6.7,SICINIUS,Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
27478,27479,Coriolanus,1.0,4.6.8,SICINIUS,Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
27479,27480,Coriolanus,1.0,4.6.9,SICINIUS,About their functions friendly.
27480,27481,Coriolanus,2.0,4.6.10,BRUTUS,We stood to't in good time.
27481,27482,Coriolanus,2.0,,BRUTUS,Enter MENENIUS
27482,27483,Coriolanus,2.0,4.6.11,BRUTUS,Is this Menenius?
27483,27484,Coriolanus,3.0,4.6.12,SICINIUS,"'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late."
27484,27485,Coriolanus,4.0,4.6.13,Both Tribunes,Hail sir!
27485,27486,Coriolanus,5.0,4.6.14,MENENIUS,Hail to you both!
27486,27487,Coriolanus,6.0,4.6.15,SICINIUS,Your Coriolanus
27487,27488,Coriolanus,6.0,4.6.16,SICINIUS,"Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:"
27488,27489,Coriolanus,6.0,4.6.17,SICINIUS,"The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,"
27489,27490,Coriolanus,6.0,4.6.18,SICINIUS,Were he more angry at it.
27490,27491,Coriolanus,7.0,4.6.19,MENENIUS,"All's well, and might have been much better, if"
27491,27492,Coriolanus,7.0,4.6.20,MENENIUS,He could have temporized.
27492,27493,Coriolanus,8.0,4.6.21,SICINIUS,"Where is he, hear you?"
27493,27494,Coriolanus,9.0,4.6.22,MENENIUS,"Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife"
27494,27495,Coriolanus,9.0,4.6.23,MENENIUS,Hear nothing from him.
27495,27496,Coriolanus,9.0,,MENENIUS,Enter three or four Citizens
27496,27497,Coriolanus,10.0,4.6.24,Citizens,The gods preserve you both!
27497,27498,Coriolanus,11.0,4.6.25,SICINIUS,"God-den, our neighbours."
27498,27499,Coriolanus,12.0,4.6.26,BRUTUS,"God-den to you all, god-den to you all."
27499,27500,Coriolanus,13.0,4.6.27,First Citizen,"Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,"
27500,27501,Coriolanus,13.0,4.6.28,First Citizen,Are bound to pray for you both.
27501,27502,Coriolanus,14.0,4.6.29,SICINIUS,"Live, and thrive!"
27502,27503,Coriolanus,15.0,4.6.30,BRUTUS,"Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus"
27503,27504,Coriolanus,15.0,4.6.31,BRUTUS,Had loved you as we did.
27504,27505,Coriolanus,16.0,4.6.32,Citizens,Now the gods keep you!
27505,27506,Coriolanus,17.0,4.6.33,Both Tribunes,"Farewell, farewell."
27506,27507,Coriolanus,17.0,,Both Tribunes,Exeunt Citizens
27507,27508,Coriolanus,18.0,4.6.34,SICINIUS,This is a happier and more comely time
27508,27509,Coriolanus,18.0,4.6.35,SICINIUS,"Than when these fellows ran about the streets,"
27509,27510,Coriolanus,18.0,4.6.36,SICINIUS,Crying confusion.
27510,27511,Coriolanus,19.0,4.6.37,BRUTUS,Caius Marcius was
27511,27512,Coriolanus,19.0,4.6.38,BRUTUS,"A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,"
27512,27513,Coriolanus,19.0,4.6.39,BRUTUS,"O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,"
27513,27514,Coriolanus,19.0,4.6.40,BRUTUS,"Self-loving,--"
27514,27515,Coriolanus,20.0,4.6.41,SICINIUS,"And affecting one sole throne,"
27515,27516,Coriolanus,20.0,4.6.42,SICINIUS,Without assistance.
27516,27517,Coriolanus,21.0,4.6.43,MENENIUS,I think not so.
27517,27518,Coriolanus,22.0,4.6.44,SICINIUS,"We should by this, to all our lamentation,"
27518,27519,Coriolanus,22.0,4.6.45,SICINIUS,"If he had gone forth consul, found it so."
27519,27520,Coriolanus,23.0,4.6.46,BRUTUS,"The gods have well prevented it, and Rome"
27520,27521,Coriolanus,23.0,4.6.47,BRUTUS,Sits safe and still without him.
27521,27522,Coriolanus,23.0,,BRUTUS,Enter an AEdile
27522,27523,Coriolanus,24.0,4.6.48,AEdile,"Worthy tribunes,"
27523,27524,Coriolanus,24.0,4.6.49,AEdile,"There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,"
27524,27525,Coriolanus,24.0,4.6.50,AEdile,"Reports, the Volsces with two several powers"
27525,27526,Coriolanus,24.0,4.6.51,AEdile,"Are enter'd in the Roman territories,"
27526,27527,Coriolanus,24.0,4.6.52,AEdile,And with the deepest malice of the war
27527,27528,Coriolanus,24.0,4.6.53,AEdile,Destroy what lies before 'em.
27528,27529,Coriolanus,25.0,4.6.54,MENENIUS,"'Tis Aufidius,"
27529,27530,Coriolanus,25.0,4.6.55,MENENIUS,"Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,"
27530,27531,Coriolanus,25.0,4.6.56,MENENIUS,"Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,"
27531,27532,Coriolanus,25.0,4.6.57,MENENIUS,"Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,"
27532,27533,Coriolanus,25.0,4.6.58,MENENIUS,And durst not once peep out.
27533,27534,Coriolanus,26.0,4.6.59,SICINIUS,"Come, what talk you"
27534,27535,Coriolanus,26.0,4.6.60,SICINIUS,Of Marcius?
27535,27536,Coriolanus,27.0,4.6.61,BRUTUS,Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
27536,27537,Coriolanus,27.0,4.6.62,BRUTUS,The Volsces dare break with us.
27537,27538,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.63,MENENIUS,Cannot be!
27538,27539,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.64,MENENIUS,"We have record that very well it can,"
27539,27540,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.65,MENENIUS,And three examples of the like have been
27540,27541,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.66,MENENIUS,"Within my age. But reason with the fellow,"
27541,27542,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.67,MENENIUS,"Before you punish him, where he heard this,"
27542,27543,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.68,MENENIUS,Lest you shall chance to whip your information
27543,27544,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.69,MENENIUS,And beat the messenger who bids beware
27544,27545,Coriolanus,28.0,4.6.70,MENENIUS,Of what is to be dreaded.
27545,27546,Coriolanus,29.0,4.6.71,SICINIUS,Tell not me:
27546,27547,Coriolanus,29.0,4.6.72,SICINIUS,I know this cannot be.
27547,27548,Coriolanus,30.0,4.6.73,BRUTUS,Not possible.
27548,27549,Coriolanus,30.0,,BRUTUS,Enter a Messenger
27549,27550,Coriolanus,31.0,4.6.74,Messenger,The nobles in great earnestness are going
27550,27551,Coriolanus,31.0,4.6.75,Messenger,All to the senate-house: some news is come
27551,27552,Coriolanus,31.0,4.6.76,Messenger,That turns their countenances.
27552,27553,Coriolanus,32.0,4.6.77,SICINIUS,"'Tis this slave,--"
27553,27554,Coriolanus,32.0,4.6.78,SICINIUS,"Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising,"
27554,27555,Coriolanus,32.0,4.6.79,SICINIUS,Nothing but his report.
27555,27556,Coriolanus,33.0,4.6.80,Messenger,"Yes, worthy sir,"
27556,27557,Coriolanus,33.0,4.6.81,Messenger,"The slave's report is seconded, and more,"
27557,27558,Coriolanus,33.0,4.6.82,Messenger,"More fearful, is deliver'd."
27558,27559,Coriolanus,34.0,4.6.83,SICINIUS,What more fearful?
27559,27560,Coriolanus,35.0,4.6.84,Messenger,It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
27560,27561,Coriolanus,35.0,4.6.85,Messenger,"How probable I do not know--that Marcius,"
27561,27562,Coriolanus,35.0,4.6.86,Messenger,"Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,"
27562,27563,Coriolanus,35.0,4.6.87,Messenger,And vows revenge as spacious as between
27563,27564,Coriolanus,35.0,4.6.88,Messenger,The young'st and oldest thing.
27564,27565,Coriolanus,36.0,4.6.89,SICINIUS,This is most likely!
27565,27566,Coriolanus,37.0,4.6.90,BRUTUS,"Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish"
27566,27567,Coriolanus,37.0,4.6.91,BRUTUS,Good Marcius home again.
27567,27568,Coriolanus,38.0,4.6.92,SICINIUS,The very trick on't.
27568,27569,Coriolanus,39.0,4.6.93,MENENIUS,This is unlikely:
27569,27570,Coriolanus,39.0,4.6.94,MENENIUS,He and Aufidius can no more atone
27570,27571,Coriolanus,39.0,4.6.95,MENENIUS,Than violentest contrariety.
27571,27572,Coriolanus,39.0,,MENENIUS,Enter a second Messenger
27572,27573,Coriolanus,40.0,4.6.96,Second Messenger,You are sent for to the senate:
27573,27574,Coriolanus,40.0,4.6.97,Second Messenger,"A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius"
27574,27575,Coriolanus,40.0,4.6.98,Second Messenger,"Associated with Aufidius, rages"
27575,27576,Coriolanus,40.0,4.6.99,Second Messenger,"Upon our territories, and have already"
27576,27577,Coriolanus,40.0,4.6.100,Second Messenger,"O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took"
27577,27578,Coriolanus,40.0,4.6.101,Second Messenger,What lay before them.
27578,27579,Coriolanus,40.0,,Second Messenger,Enter COMINIUS
27579,27580,Coriolanus,41.0,4.6.102,COMINIUS,"O, you have made good work!"
27580,27581,Coriolanus,42.0,4.6.103,MENENIUS,What news? what news?
27581,27582,Coriolanus,43.0,4.6.104,COMINIUS,You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
27582,27583,Coriolanus,43.0,4.6.105,COMINIUS,"To melt the city leads upon your pates,"
27583,27584,Coriolanus,43.0,4.6.106,COMINIUS,"To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--"
27584,27585,Coriolanus,44.0,4.6.107,MENENIUS,What's the news? what's the news?
27585,27586,Coriolanus,45.0,4.6.108,COMINIUS,"Your temples burned in their cement, and"
27586,27587,Coriolanus,45.0,4.6.109,COMINIUS,"Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined"
27587,27588,Coriolanus,45.0,4.6.110,COMINIUS,Into an auger's bore.
27588,27589,Coriolanus,46.0,4.6.111,MENENIUS,"Pray now, your news?"
27589,27590,Coriolanus,46.0,4.6.112,MENENIUS,"You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--"
27590,27591,Coriolanus,46.0,4.6.113,MENENIUS,"If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--"
27591,27592,Coriolanus,47.0,4.6.114,COMINIUS,If!
27592,27593,Coriolanus,47.0,4.6.115,COMINIUS,He is their god: he leads them like a thing
27593,27594,Coriolanus,47.0,4.6.116,COMINIUS,"Made by some other deity than nature,"
27594,27595,Coriolanus,47.0,4.6.117,COMINIUS,"That shapes man better, and they follow him,"
27595,27596,Coriolanus,47.0,4.6.118,COMINIUS,"Against us brats, with no less confidence"
27596,27597,Coriolanus,47.0,4.6.119,COMINIUS,"Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,"
27597,27598,Coriolanus,47.0,4.6.120,COMINIUS,Or butchers killing flies.
27598,27599,Coriolanus,48.0,4.6.121,MENENIUS,"You have made good work,"
27599,27600,Coriolanus,48.0,4.6.122,MENENIUS,"You and your apron-men, you that stood so up much"
27600,27601,Coriolanus,48.0,4.6.123,MENENIUS,on the voice of occupation and
27601,27602,Coriolanus,48.0,4.6.124,MENENIUS,The breath of garlic-eaters!
27602,27603,Coriolanus,49.0,4.6.125,COMINIUS,He will shake
27603,27604,Coriolanus,49.0,4.6.126,COMINIUS,Your Rome about your ears.
27604,27605,Coriolanus,50.0,4.6.127,MENENIUS,As Hercules
27605,27606,Coriolanus,50.0,4.6.128,MENENIUS,Did shake down mellow fruit.
27606,27607,Coriolanus,50.0,4.6.129,MENENIUS,You have made fair work!
27607,27608,Coriolanus,51.0,4.6.130,BRUTUS,"But is this true, sir?"
27608,27609,Coriolanus,52.0,4.6.131,COMINIUS,"Ay, and you'll look pale"
27609,27610,Coriolanus,52.0,4.6.132,COMINIUS,Before you find it other. All the regions
27610,27611,Coriolanus,52.0,4.6.133,COMINIUS,"Do smilingly revolt, and who resist"
27611,27612,Coriolanus,52.0,4.6.134,COMINIUS,"Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,"
27612,27613,Coriolanus,52.0,4.6.135,COMINIUS,And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?

27614,27615,Coriolanus,53.0,4.6.137,MENENIUS,"We are all undone, unless"
27615,27616,Coriolanus,53.0,4.6.138,MENENIUS,The noble man have mercy.
27616,27617,Coriolanus,54.0,4.6.139,COMINIUS,Who shall ask it?
27617,27618,Coriolanus,54.0,4.6.140,COMINIUS,"The tribunes cannot do't for shame, the people"
27618,27619,Coriolanus,54.0,4.6.141,COMINIUS,Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
27619,27620,Coriolanus,54.0,4.6.142,COMINIUS,"Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they"
27620,27621,Coriolanus,54.0,4.6.143,COMINIUS,"Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even"
27621,27622,Coriolanus,54.0,4.6.144,COMINIUS,"As those should do that had deserved his hate,"
27622,27623,Coriolanus,54.0,4.6.145,COMINIUS,And therein show'd like enemies.
27623,27624,Coriolanus,55.0,4.6.146,MENENIUS,'Tis true:

27626,27627,Coriolanus,55.0,4.6.149,MENENIUS,"To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,"
27627,27628,Coriolanus,55.0,4.6.150,MENENIUS,You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
27628,27629,Coriolanus,56.0,4.6.151,COMINIUS,You have brought

27630,27631,Coriolanus,56.0,4.6.153,COMINIUS,So incapable of help.
27631,27632,Coriolanus,57.0,4.6.154,Both Tribunes,Say not we brought it.
27632,27633,Coriolanus,58.0,4.6.155,MENENIUS,"How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts"
27633,27634,Coriolanus,58.0,4.6.156,MENENIUS,"And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,"
27634,27635,Coriolanus,58.0,4.6.157,MENENIUS,Who did hoot him out o' the city.
27635,27636,Coriolanus,59.0,4.6.158,COMINIUS,But I fear
27636,27637,Coriolanus,59.0,4.6.159,COMINIUS,"They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,"
27637,27638,Coriolanus,59.0,4.6.160,COMINIUS,"The second name of men, obeys his points"
27638,27639,Coriolanus,59.0,4.6.161,COMINIUS,As if he were his officer: desperation
27639,27640,Coriolanus,59.0,4.6.162,COMINIUS,"Is all the policy, strength and defence,"
27640,27641,Coriolanus,59.0,4.6.163,COMINIUS,That Rome can make against them.
27641,27642,Coriolanus,59.0,,COMINIUS,Enter a troop of Citizens
27642,27643,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.164,MENENIUS,Here come the clusters.
27643,27644,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.165,MENENIUS,And is Aufidius with him? You are they
27644,27645,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.166,MENENIUS,"That made the air unwholesome, when you cast"
27645,27646,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.167,MENENIUS,Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at

27647,27648,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.169,MENENIUS,And not a hair upon a soldier's head
27648,27649,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.170,MENENIUS,Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
27649,27650,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.171,MENENIUS,"As you threw caps up will he tumble down,"
27650,27651,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.172,MENENIUS,"And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter,"
27651,27652,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.173,MENENIUS,"if he could burn us all into one coal,"
27652,27653,Coriolanus,60.0,4.6.174,MENENIUS,We have deserved it.

27655,27656,Coriolanus,62.0,4.6.177,First Citizen,"When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity."
27656,27657,Coriolanus,63.0,4.6.178,Second Citizen,And so did I.
27657,27658,Coriolanus,64.0,4.6.179,Third Citizen,"And so did I, and, to say the truth, so did very"
27658,27659,Coriolanus,64.0,4.6.180,Third Citizen,"many of us: that we did, we did for the best, and"
27659,27660,Coriolanus,64.0,4.6.181,Third Citizen,"though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet"
27660,27661,Coriolanus,64.0,4.6.182,Third Citizen,it was against our will.
27661,27662,Coriolanus,65.0,4.6.183,COMINIUS,"Ye re goodly things, you voices!"
27662,27663,Coriolanus,66.0,4.6.184,MENENIUS,You have made
27663,27664,Coriolanus,66.0,4.6.185,MENENIUS,"Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?"
27664,27665,Coriolanus,67.0,4.6.186,COMINIUS,"O, ay, what else?"
27665,27666,Coriolanus,67.0,,COMINIUS,Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
27666,27667,Coriolanus,68.0,4.6.187,SICINIUS,"Go, masters, get you home, be not dismay'd:"
27667,27668,Coriolanus,68.0,4.6.188,SICINIUS,These are a side that would be glad to have
27668,27669,Coriolanus,68.0,4.6.189,SICINIUS,"This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,"
27669,27670,Coriolanus,68.0,4.6.190,SICINIUS,And show no sign of fear.
27670,27671,Coriolanus,69.0,4.6.191,First Citizen,"The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home."
27671,27672,Coriolanus,69.0,4.6.192,First Citizen,I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
27672,27673,Coriolanus,69.0,4.6.193,First Citizen,him.
27673,27674,Coriolanus,70.0,4.6.194,Second Citizen,"So did we all. But, come, let's home."

27675,27676,Coriolanus,71.0,4.6.195,BRUTUS,I do not like this news.
27676,27677,Coriolanus,72.0,4.6.196,SICINIUS,Nor I.
27677,27678,Coriolanus,73.0,4.6.197,BRUTUS,Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
27678,27679,Coriolanus,73.0,4.6.198,BRUTUS,Would buy this for a lie!
27679,27680,Coriolanus,74.0,4.6.199,SICINIUS,"Pray, let us go."

27682,27683,Coriolanus,74.0,,SICINIUS,Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant
27683,27684,Coriolanus,1.0,4.7.1,AUFIDIUS,Do they still fly to the Roman?
27684,27685,Coriolanus,2.0,4.7.2,Lieutenant,"I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but"
27685,27686,Coriolanus,2.0,4.7.3,Lieutenant,"Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,"
27686,27687,Coriolanus,2.0,4.7.4,Lieutenant,"Their talk at table, and their thanks at end,"
27687,27688,Coriolanus,2.0,4.7.5,Lieutenant,"And you are darken'd in this action, sir,"
27688,27689,Coriolanus,2.0,4.7.6,Lieutenant,Even by your own.
27689,27690,Coriolanus,3.0,4.7.7,AUFIDIUS,"I cannot help it now,"
27690,27691,Coriolanus,3.0,4.7.8,AUFIDIUS,"Unless, by using means, I lame the foot"
27691,27692,Coriolanus,3.0,4.7.9,AUFIDIUS,"Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,"
27692,27693,Coriolanus,3.0,4.7.10,AUFIDIUS,"Even to my person, than I thought he would"
27693,27694,Coriolanus,3.0,4.7.11,AUFIDIUS,When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
27694,27695,Coriolanus,3.0,4.7.12,AUFIDIUS,"In that's no changeling, and I must excuse"
27695,27696,Coriolanus,3.0,4.7.13,AUFIDIUS,What cannot be amended.
27696,27697,Coriolanus,4.0,4.7.14,Lieutenant,"Yet I wish, sir,--"
27697,27698,Coriolanus,4.0,4.7.15,Lieutenant,"I mean for your particular,--you had not"
27698,27699,Coriolanus,4.0,4.7.16,Lieutenant,"Join'd in commission with him, but either"
27699,27700,Coriolanus,4.0,4.7.17,Lieutenant,"Had borne the action of yourself, or else"
27700,27701,Coriolanus,4.0,4.7.18,Lieutenant,To him had left it solely.
27701,27702,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.19,AUFIDIUS,"I understand thee well, and be thou sure,"
27702,27703,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.20,AUFIDIUS,"when he shall come to his account, he knows not"
27703,27704,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.21,AUFIDIUS,"What I can urge against him. Although it seems,"
27704,27705,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.22,AUFIDIUS,"And so he thinks, and is no less apparent"
27705,27706,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.23,AUFIDIUS,"To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly."
27706,27707,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.24,AUFIDIUS,"And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,"
27707,27708,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.25,AUFIDIUS,"Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon"
27708,27709,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.26,AUFIDIUS,"As draw his sword, yet he hath left undone"
27709,27710,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.27,AUFIDIUS,"That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,"
27710,27711,Coriolanus,5.0,4.7.28,AUFIDIUS,Whene'er we come to our account.
27711,27712,Coriolanus,6.0,4.7.29,Lieutenant,"Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?"
27712,27713,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.30,AUFIDIUS,"All places yield to him ere he sits down,"
27713,27714,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.31,AUFIDIUS,And the nobility of Rome are his:
27714,27715,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.32,AUFIDIUS,The senators and patricians love him too:
27715,27716,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.33,AUFIDIUS,"The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people"
27716,27717,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.34,AUFIDIUS,"Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty"
27717,27718,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.35,AUFIDIUS,To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
27718,27719,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.36,AUFIDIUS,"As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it"
27719,27720,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.37,AUFIDIUS,By sovereignty of nature. First he was
27720,27721,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.38,AUFIDIUS,"A noble servant to them, but he could not"
27721,27722,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.39,AUFIDIUS,"Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,"
27722,27723,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.40,AUFIDIUS,Which out of daily fortune ever taints
27723,27724,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.41,AUFIDIUS,"The happy man, whether defect of judgment,"
27724,27725,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.42,AUFIDIUS,To fail in the disposing of those chances
27725,27726,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.43,AUFIDIUS,"Which he was lord of, or whether nature,"
27726,27727,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.44,AUFIDIUS,"Not to be other than one thing, not moving"
27727,27728,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.45,AUFIDIUS,"From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace"
27728,27729,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.46,AUFIDIUS,Even with the same austerity and garb
27729,27730,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.47,AUFIDIUS,"As he controll'd the war, but one of these--"
27730,27731,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.48,AUFIDIUS,"As he hath spices of them all, not all,"
27731,27732,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.49,AUFIDIUS,"For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,"
27732,27733,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.50,AUFIDIUS,"So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,"
27733,27734,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.51,AUFIDIUS,To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
27734,27735,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.52,AUFIDIUS,Lie in the interpretation of the time:
27735,27736,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.53,AUFIDIUS,"And power, unto itself most commendable,"
27736,27737,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.54,AUFIDIUS,Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
27737,27738,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.55,AUFIDIUS,To extol what it hath done.
27738,27739,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.56,AUFIDIUS,"One fire drives out one fire, one nail, one nail,"
27739,27740,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.57,AUFIDIUS,"Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail."
27740,27741,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.58,AUFIDIUS,"Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,"
27741,27742,Coriolanus,7.0,4.7.59,AUFIDIUS,"Thou art poor'st of all, then shortly art thou mine."
27742,27743,Coriolanus,7.0,,AUFIDIUS,Exeunt
27743,27744,Coriolanus,7.0,,AUFIDIUS,ACT V
27744,27745,Coriolanus,7.0,,AUFIDIUS,SCENE I. Rome. A public place.
27745,27746,Coriolanus,7.0,,AUFIDIUS,"Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and others"
27746,27747,Coriolanus,1.0,5.1.1,MENENIUS,"No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said"
27747,27748,Coriolanus,1.0,5.1.2,MENENIUS,"Which was sometime his general, who loved him"
27748,27749,Coriolanus,1.0,5.1.3,MENENIUS,In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
27749,27750,Coriolanus,1.0,5.1.4,MENENIUS,"But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him,"
27750,27751,Coriolanus,1.0,5.1.5,MENENIUS,"A mile before his tent fall down, and knee"
27751,27752,Coriolanus,1.0,5.1.6,MENENIUS,"The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd"
27752,27753,Coriolanus,1.0,5.1.7,MENENIUS,"To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home."
27753,27754,Coriolanus,2.0,5.1.8,COMINIUS,He would not seem to know me.
27754,27755,Coriolanus,3.0,5.1.9,MENENIUS,Do you hear?
27755,27756,Coriolanus,4.0,5.1.10,COMINIUS,Yet one time he did call me by my name:
27756,27757,Coriolanus,4.0,5.1.11,COMINIUS,"I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops"
27757,27758,Coriolanus,4.0,5.1.12,COMINIUS,That we have bled together. Coriolanus
27758,27759,Coriolanus,4.0,5.1.13,COMINIUS,"He would not answer to: forbad all names,"
27759,27760,Coriolanus,4.0,5.1.14,COMINIUS,"He was a kind of nothing, titleless,"
27760,27761,Coriolanus,4.0,5.1.15,COMINIUS,Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
27761,27762,Coriolanus,4.0,5.1.16,COMINIUS,Of burning Rome.
27762,27763,Coriolanus,5.0,5.1.17,MENENIUS,"Why, so: you have made good work!"
27763,27764,Coriolanus,5.0,5.1.18,MENENIUS,"A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,"
27764,27765,Coriolanus,5.0,5.1.19,MENENIUS,"To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!"
27765,27766,Coriolanus,6.0,5.1.20,COMINIUS,I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
27766,27767,Coriolanus,6.0,5.1.21,COMINIUS,"When it was less expected: he replied,"
27767,27768,Coriolanus,6.0,5.1.22,COMINIUS,It was a bare petition of a state
27768,27769,Coriolanus,6.0,5.1.23,COMINIUS,To one whom they had punish'd.
27769,27770,Coriolanus,7.0,5.1.24,MENENIUS,Very well:
27770,27771,Coriolanus,7.0,5.1.25,MENENIUS,Could he say less?
27771,27772,Coriolanus,8.0,5.1.26,COMINIUS,I offer'd to awaken his regard
27772,27773,Coriolanus,8.0,5.1.27,COMINIUS,"For's private friends: his answer to me was,"
27773,27774,Coriolanus,8.0,5.1.28,COMINIUS,He could not stay to pick them in a pile
27774,27775,Coriolanus,8.0,5.1.29,COMINIUS,"Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,"
27775,27776,Coriolanus,8.0,5.1.30,COMINIUS,"For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,"
27776,27777,Coriolanus,8.0,5.1.31,COMINIUS,And still to nose the offence.
27777,27778,Coriolanus,9.0,5.1.32,MENENIUS,For one poor grain or two!
27778,27779,Coriolanus,9.0,5.1.33,MENENIUS,"I am one of those, his mother, wife, his child,"
27779,27780,Coriolanus,9.0,5.1.34,MENENIUS,"And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:"
27780,27781,Coriolanus,9.0,5.1.35,MENENIUS,"You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt"
27781,27782,Coriolanus,9.0,5.1.36,MENENIUS,Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
27782,27783,Coriolanus,10.0,5.1.37,SICINIUS,"Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid"
27783,27784,Coriolanus,10.0,5.1.38,SICINIUS,"In this so never-needed help, yet do not"
27784,27785,Coriolanus,10.0,5.1.39,SICINIUS,"Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you"
27785,27786,Coriolanus,10.0,5.1.40,SICINIUS,"Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,"
27786,27787,Coriolanus,10.0,5.1.41,SICINIUS,"More than the instant army we can make,"
27787,27788,Coriolanus,10.0,5.1.42,SICINIUS,Might stop our countryman.
27788,27789,Coriolanus,11.0,5.1.43,MENENIUS,"No, I'll not meddle."
27789,27790,Coriolanus,12.0,5.1.44,SICINIUS,"Pray you, go to him."
27790,27791,Coriolanus,13.0,5.1.45,MENENIUS,What should I do?
27791,27792,Coriolanus,14.0,5.1.46,BRUTUS,Only make trial what your love can do
27792,27793,Coriolanus,14.0,5.1.47,BRUTUS,"For Rome, towards Marcius."
27793,27794,Coriolanus,15.0,5.1.48,MENENIUS,"Well, and say that Marcius"
27794,27795,Coriolanus,15.0,5.1.49,MENENIUS,"Return me, as Cominius is return'd,"
27795,27796,Coriolanus,15.0,5.1.50,MENENIUS,"Unheard, what then?"
27796,27797,Coriolanus,15.0,5.1.51,MENENIUS,"But as a discontented friend, grief-shot"
27797,27798,Coriolanus,15.0,5.1.52,MENENIUS,With his unkindness? say't be so?
27798,27799,Coriolanus,16.0,5.1.53,SICINIUS,Yet your good will
27799,27800,Coriolanus,16.0,5.1.54,SICINIUS,"must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure"
27800,27801,Coriolanus,16.0,5.1.55,SICINIUS,As you intended well.
27801,27802,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.56,MENENIUS,I'll undertake 't:
27802,27803,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.57,MENENIUS,"I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip"
27803,27804,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.58,MENENIUS,"And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me."
27804,27805,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.59,MENENIUS,"He was not taken well, he had not dined:"
27805,27806,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.60,MENENIUS,"The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then"
27806,27807,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.61,MENENIUS,"We pout upon the morning, are unapt"
27807,27808,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.62,MENENIUS,"To give or to forgive, but when we have stuff'd"
27808,27809,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.63,MENENIUS,These and these conveyances of our blood
27809,27810,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.64,MENENIUS,"With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls"
27810,27811,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.65,MENENIUS,Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
27811,27812,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.66,MENENIUS,"Till he be dieted to my request,"
27812,27813,Coriolanus,17.0,5.1.67,MENENIUS,And then I'll set upon him.
27813,27814,Coriolanus,18.0,5.1.68,BRUTUS,"You know the very road into his kindness,"
27814,27815,Coriolanus,18.0,5.1.69,BRUTUS,And cannot lose your way.
27815,27816,Coriolanus,19.0,5.1.70,MENENIUS,"Good faith, I'll prove him,"
27816,27817,Coriolanus,19.0,5.1.71,MENENIUS,Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
27817,27818,Coriolanus,19.0,5.1.72,MENENIUS,Of my success.
27818,27819,Coriolanus,19.0,,MENENIUS,Exit
27819,27820,Coriolanus,20.0,5.1.73,COMINIUS,He'll never hear him.
27820,27821,Coriolanus,21.0,5.1.74,SICINIUS,Not?
27821,27822,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.75,COMINIUS,"I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye"
27822,27823,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.76,COMINIUS,"Red as 'twould burn Rome, and his injury"
27823,27824,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.77,COMINIUS,"The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him,"
27824,27825,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.78,COMINIUS,"'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise,' dismiss'd me"
27825,27826,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.79,COMINIUS,"Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,"
27826,27827,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.80,COMINIUS,"He sent in writing after me, what he would not,"
27827,27828,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.81,COMINIUS,Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
27828,27829,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.82,COMINIUS,So that all hope is vain.
27829,27830,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.83,COMINIUS,"Unless his noble mother, and his wife,"
27830,27831,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.84,COMINIUS,"Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him"
27831,27832,Coriolanus,22.0,5.1.85,COMINIUS,"For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,"

27839,27840,Coriolanus,3.0,5.2.4,MENENIUS,"You guard like men, 'tis well: but, by your leave,"
27840,27841,Coriolanus,3.0,5.2.5,MENENIUS,"I am an officer of state, and come"
27841,27842,Coriolanus,3.0,5.2.6,MENENIUS,To speak with Coriolanus.

27849,27850,Coriolanus,8.0,5.2.14,MENENIUS,"If you have heard your general talk of Rome,"
27850,27851,Coriolanus,8.0,5.2.15,MENENIUS,"And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,"
27851,27852,Coriolanus,8.0,5.2.16,MENENIUS,My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
27852,27853,Coriolanus,9.0,5.2.17,First Senator,"Be it so, go back: the virtue of your name"
27853,27854,Coriolanus,9.0,5.2.18,First Senator,Is not here passable.
27854,27855,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.19,MENENIUS,"I tell thee, fellow,"
27855,27856,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.20,MENENIUS,The general is my lover: I have been

27858,27859,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.23,MENENIUS,"For I have ever verified my friends,"
27859,27860,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.24,MENENIUS,"Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity"
27860,27861,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.25,MENENIUS,"Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,"
27861,27862,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.26,MENENIUS,"Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,"
27862,27863,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.27,MENENIUS,"I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise"
27863,27864,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.28,MENENIUS,"Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,"
27864,27865,Coriolanus,10.0,5.2.29,MENENIUS,I must have leave to pass.
27865,27866,Coriolanus,11.0,5.2.30,First Senator,"Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his"
27866,27867,Coriolanus,11.0,5.2.31,First Senator,"behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you"
27867,27868,Coriolanus,11.0,5.2.32,First Senator,"should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous"
27868,27869,Coriolanus,11.0,5.2.33,First Senator,"to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back."
27869,27870,Coriolanus,12.0,5.2.34,MENENIUS,"Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,"
27870,27871,Coriolanus,12.0,5.2.35,MENENIUS,always factionary on the party of your general.
27871,27872,Coriolanus,13.0,5.2.36,Second Senator,"Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you"
27872,27873,Coriolanus,13.0,5.2.37,Second Senator,"have, I am one that, telling true under him, must"
27873,27874,Coriolanus,13.0,5.2.38,Second Senator,"say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back."
27874,27875,Coriolanus,14.0,5.2.39,MENENIUS,"Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not"
27875,27876,Coriolanus,14.0,5.2.40,MENENIUS,speak with him till after dinner.
27876,27877,Coriolanus,15.0,5.2.41,First Senator,"You are a Roman, are you?"
27877,27878,Coriolanus,16.0,5.2.42,MENENIUS,"I am, as thy general is."
27878,27879,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.43,First Senator,"Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,"
27879,27880,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.44,First Senator,when you have pushed out your gates the very
27880,27881,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.45,First Senator,"defender of them, and, in a violent popular"
27881,27882,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.46,First Senator,"ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to"
27882,27883,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.47,First Senator,front his revenges with the easy groans of old
27883,27884,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.48,First Senator,"women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with"
27884,27885,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.49,First Senator,the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
27885,27886,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.50,First Senator,you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
27886,27887,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.51,First Senator,"intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with"
27887,27888,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.52,First Senator,"such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived,"
27888,27889,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.53,First Senator,"therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your"
27889,27890,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.54,First Senator,"execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn"
27890,27891,Coriolanus,17.0,5.2.55,First Senator,you out of reprieve and pardon.
27891,27892,Coriolanus,18.0,5.2.56,MENENIUS,"Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would"
27892,27893,Coriolanus,18.0,5.2.57,MENENIUS,use me with estimation.
27893,27894,Coriolanus,19.0,5.2.58,Second Senator,"Come, my captain knows you not."
27894,27895,Coriolanus,20.0,5.2.59,MENENIUS,"I mean, thy general."
27895,27896,Coriolanus,21.0,5.2.60,First Senator,"My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go, lest"
27896,27897,Coriolanus,21.0,5.2.61,First Senator,"I let forth your half-pint of blood, back,--that's"
27897,27898,Coriolanus,21.0,5.2.62,First Senator,the utmost of your having: back.

27901,27902,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.65,MENENIUS,"Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:"
27902,27903,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.66,MENENIUS,"You shall know now that I am in estimation, you shall"
27903,27904,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.67,MENENIUS,perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
27904,27905,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.68,MENENIUS,"my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment"
27905,27906,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.69,MENENIUS,"with him, if thou standest not i' the state of"
27906,27907,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.70,MENENIUS,"hanging, or of some death more long in"
27907,27908,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.71,MENENIUS,"spectatorship, and crueller in suffering, behold now"
27908,27909,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.72,MENENIUS,"presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee."

27913,27914,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.76,MENENIUS,"thou art preparing fire for us, look thee, here's"
27914,27915,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.77,MENENIUS,water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to

27916,27917,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.79,MENENIUS,"thee, I have been blown out of your gates with"
27917,27918,Coriolanus,24.0,5.2.80,MENENIUS,"sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy"

27929,27930,Coriolanus,27.0,5.2.92,CORIOLANUS,"Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone."
27930,27931,Coriolanus,27.0,5.2.93,CORIOLANUS,Mine ears against your suits are stronger than

27945,27946,Coriolanus,33.0,5.2.106,MENENIUS,I neither care for the world nor your general: for
27946,27947,Coriolanus,33.0,5.2.107,MENENIUS,"such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,"
27947,27948,Coriolanus,33.0,5.2.108,MENENIUS,ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
27948,27949,Coriolanus,33.0,5.2.109,MENENIUS,himself fears it not from another: let your general
27949,27950,Coriolanus,33.0,5.2.110,MENENIUS,"do his worst. For you, be that you are, long, and"

28016,28017,Coriolanus,7.0,5.3.55,CORIOLANUS,Of thy deep duty more impression show
28017,28018,Coriolanus,7.0,5.3.56,CORIOLANUS,Than that of common sons.
28018,28019,Coriolanus,8.0,5.3.57,VOLUMNIA,"O, stand up blest!"
28019,28020,Coriolanus,8.0,5.3.58,VOLUMNIA,"Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,"
28020,28021,Coriolanus,8.0,5.3.59,VOLUMNIA,"I kneel before thee, and unproperly"
28021,28022,Coriolanus,8.0,5.3.60,VOLUMNIA,"Show duty, as mistaken all this while"

28026,28027,Coriolanus,9.0,5.3.64,CORIOLANUS,Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
28027,28028,Coriolanus,9.0,5.3.65,CORIOLANUS,"Fillip the stars, then let the mutinous winds"
28028,28029,Coriolanus,9.0,5.3.66,CORIOLANUS,"Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun,"

28034,28035,Coriolanus,11.0,5.3.72,CORIOLANUS,"The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle"
28035,28036,Coriolanus,11.0,5.3.73,CORIOLANUS,That's curdied by the frost from purest snow

28038,28039,Coriolanus,12.0,5.3.76,VOLUMNIA,Which by the interpretation of full time
28039,28040,Coriolanus,12.0,5.3.77,VOLUMNIA,May show like all yourself.

28052,28053,Coriolanus,17.0,5.3.90,CORIOLANUS,The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
28053,28054,Coriolanus,17.0,5.3.91,CORIOLANUS,Be held by you denials. Do not bid me

28058,28059,Coriolanus,17.0,5.3.96,CORIOLANUS,Your colder reasons.
28059,28060,Coriolanus,18.0,5.3.97,VOLUMNIA,"O, no more, no more!"
28060,28061,Coriolanus,18.0,5.3.98,VOLUMNIA,"You have said you will not grant us any thing,"
28061,28062,Coriolanus,18.0,5.3.99,VOLUMNIA,"For we have nothing else to ask, but that"
28062,28063,Coriolanus,18.0,5.3.100,VOLUMNIA,"Which you deny already: yet we will ask,"
28063,28064,Coriolanus,18.0,5.3.101,VOLUMNIA,"That, if you fail in our request, the blame"
28064,28065,Coriolanus,18.0,5.3.102,VOLUMNIA,May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

28066,28067,Coriolanus,19.0,5.3.104,CORIOLANUS,Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
28067,28068,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.105,VOLUMNIA,"Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment"
28068,28069,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.106,VOLUMNIA,And state of bodies would bewray what life
28069,28070,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.107,VOLUMNIA,We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
28070,28071,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.108,VOLUMNIA,How more unfortunate than all living women
28071,28072,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.109,VOLUMNIA,"Are we come hither: since that thy sight,"
28072,28073,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.110,VOLUMNIA,which should
28073,28074,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.111,VOLUMNIA,"Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance"
28074,28075,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.112,VOLUMNIA,"with comforts,"

28076,28077,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.114,VOLUMNIA,"Making the mother, wife and child to see"
28077,28078,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.115,VOLUMNIA,"The son, the husband and the father tearing"
28078,28079,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.116,VOLUMNIA,His country's bowels out. And to poor we
28079,28080,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.117,VOLUMNIA,Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
28080,28081,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.118,VOLUMNIA,"Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort"
28081,28082,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.119,VOLUMNIA,"That all but we enjoy, for how can we,"
28082,28083,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.120,VOLUMNIA,"Alas, how can we for our country pray."
28083,28084,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.121,VOLUMNIA,"Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,"
28084,28085,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.122,VOLUMNIA,"Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose"
28085,28086,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.123,VOLUMNIA,"The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,"
28086,28087,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.124,VOLUMNIA,Our comfort in the country. We must find
28087,28088,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.125,VOLUMNIA,"An evident calamity, though we had"
28088,28089,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.126,VOLUMNIA,"Our wish, which side should win: for either thou"
28089,28090,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.127,VOLUMNIA,"Must, as a foreign recreant, be led"

28092,28093,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.130,VOLUMNIA,And bear the palm for having bravely shed
28093,28094,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.131,VOLUMNIA,"Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,"
28094,28095,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.132,VOLUMNIA,I purpose not to wait on fortune till
28095,28096,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.133,VOLUMNIA,These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
28096,28097,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.134,VOLUMNIA,Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
28097,28098,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.135,VOLUMNIA,"Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner"
28098,28099,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.136,VOLUMNIA,March to assault thy country than to tread--
28099,28100,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.137,VOLUMNIA,"Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,"
28100,28101,Coriolanus,20.0,5.3.138,VOLUMNIA,That brought thee to this world.
28101,28102,Coriolanus,21.0,5.3.139,VIRGILIA,"Ay, and mine,"
28102,28103,Coriolanus,21.0,5.3.140,VIRGILIA,"That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name"
28103,28104,Coriolanus,21.0,5.3.141,VIRGILIA,Living to time.
28104,28105,Coriolanus,22.0,5.3.142,Young MARCIUS,"A' shall not tread on me,"

28107,28108,Coriolanus,23.0,5.3.145,CORIOLANUS,Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
28108,28109,Coriolanus,23.0,5.3.146,CORIOLANUS,I have sat too long.
28109,28110,Coriolanus,23.0,,CORIOLANUS,Rising
28110,28111,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.147,VOLUMNIA,"Nay, go not from us thus."
28111,28112,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.148,VOLUMNIA,If it were so that our request did tend
28112,28113,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.149,VOLUMNIA,"To save the Romans, thereby to destroy"
28113,28114,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.150,VOLUMNIA,"The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,"
28114,28115,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.151,VOLUMNIA,"As poisonous of your honour: no, our suit"
28115,28116,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.152,VOLUMNIA,Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
28116,28117,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.153,VOLUMNIA,"May say 'This mercy we have show'd,' the Romans,"
28117,28118,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.154,VOLUMNIA,"'This we received,' and each in either side"
28118,28119,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.155,VOLUMNIA,Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
28119,28120,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.156,VOLUMNIA,"For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,"
28120,28121,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.157,VOLUMNIA,"The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,"
28121,28122,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.158,VOLUMNIA,"That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit"
28122,28123,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.159,VOLUMNIA,"Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,"
28123,28124,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.160,VOLUMNIA,"Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses,"
28124,28125,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.161,VOLUMNIA,"Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,"
28125,28126,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.162,VOLUMNIA,"But with his last attempt he wiped it out,"
28126,28127,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.163,VOLUMNIA,"Destroy'd his country, and his name remains"
28127,28128,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.164,VOLUMNIA,"To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:"
28128,28129,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.165,VOLUMNIA,"Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,"
28129,28130,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.166,VOLUMNIA,"To imitate the graces of the gods,"
28130,28131,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.167,VOLUMNIA,"To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,"
28131,28132,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.168,VOLUMNIA,And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
28132,28133,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.169,VOLUMNIA,That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
28133,28134,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.170,VOLUMNIA,Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
28134,28135,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.171,VOLUMNIA,"Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:"
28135,28136,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.172,VOLUMNIA,"He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:"
28136,28137,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.173,VOLUMNIA,Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
28137,28138,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.174,VOLUMNIA,Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
28138,28139,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.175,VOLUMNIA,"More bound to 's mother, yet here he lets me prate"
28139,28140,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.176,VOLUMNIA,Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
28140,28141,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.177,VOLUMNIA,"Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,"
28141,28142,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.178,VOLUMNIA,"When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,"
28142,28143,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.179,VOLUMNIA,"Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,"
28143,28144,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.180,VOLUMNIA,"Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,"
28144,28145,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.181,VOLUMNIA,"And spurn me back: but if it be not so,"
28145,28146,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.182,VOLUMNIA,"Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee,"
28146,28147,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.183,VOLUMNIA,That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
28147,28148,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.184,VOLUMNIA,To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
28148,28149,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.185,VOLUMNIA,"Down, ladies, let us shame him with our knees."
28149,28150,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.186,VOLUMNIA,To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
28150,28151,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.187,VOLUMNIA,"Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end,"
28151,28152,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.188,VOLUMNIA,"This is the last: so we will home to Rome,"
28152,28153,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.189,VOLUMNIA,"And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:"
28153,28154,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.190,VOLUMNIA,"This boy, that cannot tell what he would have"
28154,28155,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.191,VOLUMNIA,"But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,"
28155,28156,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.192,VOLUMNIA,Does reason our petition with more strength
28156,28157,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.193,VOLUMNIA,"Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:"
28157,28158,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.194,VOLUMNIA,"This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,"
28158,28159,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.195,VOLUMNIA,His wife is in Corioli and his child
28159,28160,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.196,VOLUMNIA,Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
28160,28161,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.197,VOLUMNIA,"I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,"
28161,28162,Coriolanus,24.0,5.3.198,VOLUMNIA,And then I'll speak a little.
28162,28163,Coriolanus,24.0,,VOLUMNIA,"He holds her by the hand, silent"
28163,28164,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.199,CORIOLANUS,"O mother, mother!"
28164,28165,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.200,CORIOLANUS,"What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,"
28165,28166,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.201,CORIOLANUS,"The gods look down, and this unnatural scene"
28166,28167,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.202,CORIOLANUS,"They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!"
28167,28168,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.203,CORIOLANUS,"You have won a happy victory to Rome,"
28168,28169,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.204,CORIOLANUS,"But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,"
28169,28170,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.205,CORIOLANUS,"Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,"
28170,28171,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.206,CORIOLANUS,"If not most mortal to him. But, let it come."
28171,28172,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.207,CORIOLANUS,"Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,"
28172,28173,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.208,CORIOLANUS,"I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,"
28173,28174,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.209,CORIOLANUS,"Were you in my stead, would you have heard"
28174,28175,Coriolanus,25.0,5.3.210,CORIOLANUS,"A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?"
28175,28176,Coriolanus,26.0,5.3.211,AUFIDIUS,I was moved withal.
28176,28177,Coriolanus,27.0,5.3.212,CORIOLANUS,I dare be sworn you were:
28177,28178,Coriolanus,27.0,5.3.213,CORIOLANUS,"And, sir, it is no little thing to make"
28178,28179,Coriolanus,27.0,5.3.214,CORIOLANUS,"Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,"

28191,28192,Coriolanus,29.0,5.3.225,CORIOLANUS,"On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd."
28192,28193,Coriolanus,29.0,5.3.226,CORIOLANUS,"Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve"
28193,28194,Coriolanus,29.0,5.3.227,CORIOLANUS,To have a temple built you: all the swords
28194,28195,Coriolanus,29.0,5.3.228,CORIOLANUS,"In Italy, and her confederate arms,"
28195,28196,Coriolanus,29.0,5.3.229,CORIOLANUS,Could not have made this peace.

28198,28199,Coriolanus,29.0,,CORIOLANUS,Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
28199,28200,Coriolanus,1.0,5.4.1,MENENIUS,"See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond"
28200,28201,Coriolanus,1.0,5.4.2,MENENIUS,corner-stone?
28201,28202,Coriolanus,2.0,5.4.3,SICINIUS,"Why, what of that?"
28202,28203,Coriolanus,3.0,5.4.4,MENENIUS,If it be possible for you to displace it with your
28203,28204,Coriolanus,3.0,5.4.5,MENENIUS,"little finger, there is some hope the ladies of"
28204,28205,Coriolanus,3.0,5.4.6,MENENIUS,"Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him."
28205,28206,Coriolanus,3.0,5.4.7,MENENIUS,But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
28206,28207,Coriolanus,3.0,5.4.8,MENENIUS,sentenced and stay upon execution.
28207,28208,Coriolanus,4.0,5.4.9,SICINIUS,Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
28208,28209,Coriolanus,4.0,5.4.10,SICINIUS,condition of a man!
28209,28210,Coriolanus,5.0,5.4.11,MENENIUS,"There is differency between a grub and a butterfly,"
28210,28211,Coriolanus,5.0,5.4.12,MENENIUS,yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown

28212,28213,Coriolanus,5.0,5.4.14,MENENIUS,creeping thing.
28213,28214,Coriolanus,6.0,5.4.15,SICINIUS,He loved his mother dearly.
28214,28215,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.16,MENENIUS,So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
28215,28216,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.17,MENENIUS,now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
28216,28217,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.18,MENENIUS,"of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he"
28217,28218,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.19,MENENIUS,"moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before"
28218,28219,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.20,MENENIUS,his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
28219,28220,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.21,MENENIUS,"his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a"
28220,28221,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.22,MENENIUS,"battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for"
28221,28222,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.23,MENENIUS,Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
28222,28223,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.24,MENENIUS,his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
28223,28224,Coriolanus,7.0,5.4.25,MENENIUS,and a heaven to throne in.
28224,28225,Coriolanus,8.0,5.4.26,SICINIUS,"Yes, mercy, if you report him truly."
28225,28226,Coriolanus,9.0,5.4.27,MENENIUS,I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
28226,28227,Coriolanus,9.0,5.4.28,MENENIUS,mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
28227,28228,Coriolanus,9.0,5.4.29,MENENIUS,"in him than there is milk in a male tiger, that"
28228,28229,Coriolanus,9.0,5.4.30,MENENIUS,shall our poor city find: and all this is long of

28232,28233,Coriolanus,11.0,5.4.34,MENENIUS,"us. When we banished him, we respected not them,"
28233,28234,Coriolanus,11.0,5.4.35,MENENIUS,"and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us."

28247,28248,Coriolanus,15.0,5.4.47,SICINIUS,Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
28248,28249,Coriolanus,16.0,5.4.48,Second Messenger,As certain as I know the sun is fire:
28249,28250,Coriolanus,16.0,5.4.49,Second Messenger,"Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?"
28250,28251,Coriolanus,16.0,5.4.50,Second Messenger,"Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,"
28251,28252,Coriolanus,16.0,5.4.51,Second Messenger,"As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!"

28261,28262,Coriolanus,17.0,5.4.59,MENENIUS,A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:

28314,28315,Coriolanus,7.0,5.6.27,AUFIDIUS,"He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,"

28354,28355,Coriolanus,14.0,5.6.66,Third Conspirator,"Which we will second. When he lies along,"
28355,28356,Coriolanus,14.0,5.6.67,Third Conspirator,After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
28356,28357,Coriolanus,14.0,5.6.68,Third Conspirator,His reasons with his body.

28361,28362,Coriolanus,17.0,5.6.72,AUFIDIUS,I have not deserved it.
28362,28363,Coriolanus,17.0,5.6.73,AUFIDIUS,"But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused"
28363,28364,Coriolanus,17.0,5.6.74,AUFIDIUS,What I have written to you?
28364,28365,Coriolanus,18.0,5.6.75,Lords,We have.
28365,28366,Coriolanus,19.0,5.6.76,First Lord,And grieve to hear't.
28366,28367,Coriolanus,19.0,5.6.77,First Lord,"What faults he made before the last, I think"
28367,28368,Coriolanus,19.0,5.6.78,First Lord,Might have found easy fines: but there to end
28368,28369,Coriolanus,19.0,5.6.79,First Lord,Where he was to begin and give away
28369,28370,Coriolanus,19.0,5.6.80,First Lord,"The benefit of our levies, answering us"
28370,28371,Coriolanus,19.0,5.6.81,First Lord,"With our own charge, making a treaty where"
28371,28372,Coriolanus,19.0,5.6.82,First Lord,"There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse."
28372,28373,Coriolanus,20.0,5.6.83,AUFIDIUS,He approaches: you shall hear him.
28373,28374,Coriolanus,20.0,5.6.83,AUFIDIUS,"Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours, commoners being with him"
28374,28375,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.84,CORIOLANUS,"Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,"
28375,28376,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.85,CORIOLANUS,No more infected with my country's love
28376,28377,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.86,CORIOLANUS,"Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting"
28377,28378,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.87,CORIOLANUS,Under your great command. You are to know
28378,28379,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.88,CORIOLANUS,That prosperously I have attempted and
28379,28380,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.89,CORIOLANUS,With bloody passage led your wars even to
28380,28381,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.90,CORIOLANUS,The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
28381,28382,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.91,CORIOLANUS,Do more than counterpoise a full third part
28382,28383,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.92,CORIOLANUS,The charges of the action. We have made peace
28383,28384,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.93,CORIOLANUS,With no less honour to the Antiates
28384,28385,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.94,CORIOLANUS,"Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,"
28385,28386,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.95,CORIOLANUS,"Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,"
28386,28387,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.96,CORIOLANUS,"Together with the seal o' the senate, what"
28387,28388,Coriolanus,21.0,5.6.97,CORIOLANUS,We have compounded on.
28388,28389,Coriolanus,22.0,5.6.98,AUFIDIUS,"Read it not, noble lords,"
28389,28390,Coriolanus,22.0,5.6.99,AUFIDIUS,"But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree"
28390,28391,Coriolanus,22.0,5.6.100,AUFIDIUS,He hath abused your powers.
28391,28392,Coriolanus,23.0,5.6.101,CORIOLANUS,Traitor! how now!
28392,28393,Coriolanus,24.0,5.6.102,AUFIDIUS,"Ay, traitor, Marcius!"
28393,28394,Coriolanus,25.0,5.6.103,CORIOLANUS,Marcius!
28394,28395,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.104,AUFIDIUS,"Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think"
28395,28396,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.105,AUFIDIUS,"I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name"
28396,28397,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.106,AUFIDIUS,Coriolanus in Corioli?
28397,28398,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.107,AUFIDIUS,"You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously"
28398,28399,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.108,AUFIDIUS,"He has betray'd your business, and given up,"
28399,28400,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.109,AUFIDIUS,"For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,"
28400,28401,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.110,AUFIDIUS,"I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother,"
28401,28402,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.111,AUFIDIUS,Breaking his oath and resolution like
28402,28403,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.112,AUFIDIUS,"A twist of rotten silk, never admitting"
28403,28404,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.113,AUFIDIUS,"Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears"
28404,28405,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.114,AUFIDIUS,"He whined and roar'd away your victory,"
28405,28406,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.115,AUFIDIUS,That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
28406,28407,Coriolanus,26.0,5.6.116,AUFIDIUS,Look'd wondering each at other.
28407,28408,Coriolanus,27.0,5.6.117,CORIOLANUS,"Hear'st thou, Mars?"
28408,28409,Coriolanus,28.0,5.6.118,AUFIDIUS,"Name not the god, thou boy of tears!"
28409,28410,Coriolanus,29.0,5.6.119,CORIOLANUS,Ha!
28410,28411,Coriolanus,30.0,5.6.120,AUFIDIUS,No more.
28411,28412,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.121,CORIOLANUS,"Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart"
28412,28413,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.122,CORIOLANUS,Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
28413,28414,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.123,CORIOLANUS,"Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever"
28414,28415,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.124,CORIOLANUS,"I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,"
28415,28416,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.125,CORIOLANUS,Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
28416,28417,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.126,CORIOLANUS,"Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him, that"
28417,28418,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.127,CORIOLANUS,Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
28418,28419,Coriolanus,31.0,5.6.128,CORIOLANUS,To thrust the lie unto him.
28419,28420,Coriolanus,32.0,5.6.129,First Lord,"Peace, both, and hear me speak."
28420,28421,Coriolanus,33.0,5.6.130,CORIOLANUS,"Cut me to pieces, Volsces, men and lads,"
28421,28422,Coriolanus,33.0,5.6.131,CORIOLANUS,Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
28422,28423,Coriolanus,33.0,5.6.132,CORIOLANUS,"If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,"
28423,28424,Coriolanus,33.0,5.6.133,CORIOLANUS,"That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I"
28424,28425,Coriolanus,33.0,5.6.134,CORIOLANUS,Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
28425,28426,Coriolanus,33.0,5.6.135,CORIOLANUS,Alone I did it. Boy!
28426,28427,Coriolanus,34.0,5.6.136,AUFIDIUS,"Why, noble lords,"
28427,28428,Coriolanus,34.0,5.6.137,AUFIDIUS,"Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,"
28428,28429,Coriolanus,34.0,5.6.138,AUFIDIUS,"Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,"
28429,28430,Coriolanus,34.0,5.6.139,AUFIDIUS,'Fore your own eyes and ears?
28430,28431,Coriolanus,35.0,5.6.140,All Conspirators,Let him die for't.
28431,28432,Coriolanus,36.0,5.6.141,All The People,'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd

28435,28436,Coriolanus,37.0,5.6.145,Second Lord,The man is noble and his fame folds-in
28436,28437,Coriolanus,37.0,5.6.146,Second Lord,This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
28437,28438,Coriolanus,37.0,5.6.147,Second Lord,"Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,"
28438,28439,Coriolanus,37.0,5.6.148,Second Lord,And trouble not the peace.
28439,28440,Coriolanus,38.0,5.6.149,CORIOLANUS,"O that I had him,"
28440,28441,Coriolanus,38.0,5.6.150,CORIOLANUS,"With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,"
28441,28442,Coriolanus,38.0,5.6.151,CORIOLANUS,To use my lawful sword!
28442,28443,Coriolanus,39.0,5.6.152,AUFIDIUS,Insolent villain!
28443,28444,Coriolanus,40.0,5.6.153,All Conspirators,"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!"
28444,28445,Coriolanus,40.0,5.6.153,All Conspirators,"The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body"

28450,28451,Coriolanus,45.0,5.6.159,Third Lord,Put up your swords.

28454,28455,Coriolanus,46.0,5.6.163,AUFIDIUS,That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
28455,28456,Coriolanus,46.0,5.6.164,AUFIDIUS,"To call me to your senate, I'll deliver"

28458,28459,Coriolanus,47.0,5.6.167,First Lord,"Bear from hence his body,"
28459,28460,Coriolanus,47.0,5.6.168,First Lord,And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
28460,28461,Coriolanus,47.0,5.6.169,First Lord,As the most noble corse that ever herald

28463,28464,Coriolanus,48.0,5.6.172,Second Lord,Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
28464,28465,Coriolanus,48.0,5.6.173,Second Lord,Let's make the best of it.

28466,28467,Coriolanus,49.0,5.6.175,AUFIDIUS,And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.

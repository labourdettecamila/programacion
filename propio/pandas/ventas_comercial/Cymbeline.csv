28474,28475,Cymbeline,49.0,,AUFIDIUS,ACT I
28475,28476,Cymbeline,49.0,,AUFIDIUS,SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.
28476,28477,Cymbeline,49.0,,AUFIDIUS,Enter two Gentlemen
28477,28478,Cymbeline,1.0,1.1.1,First Gentleman,You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
28478,28479,Cymbeline,1.0,1.1.2,First Gentleman,No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
28479,28480,Cymbeline,1.0,1.1.3,First Gentleman,Still seem as does the king.
28480,28481,Cymbeline,2.0,1.1.4,Second Gentleman,But what's the matter?
28481,28482,Cymbeline,3.0,1.1.5,First Gentleman,"His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom"
28482,28483,Cymbeline,3.0,1.1.6,First Gentleman,He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
28483,28484,Cymbeline,3.0,1.1.7,First Gentleman,That late he married--hath referr'd herself
28484,28485,Cymbeline,3.0,1.1.8,First Gentleman,"Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded,"
28485,28486,Cymbeline,3.0,1.1.9,First Gentleman,"Her husband banish'd, she imprison'd: all"
28486,28487,Cymbeline,3.0,1.1.10,First Gentleman,"Is outward sorrow, though I think the king"
28487,28488,Cymbeline,3.0,1.1.11,First Gentleman,Be touch'd at very heart.
28488,28489,Cymbeline,4.0,1.1.12,Second Gentleman,None but the king?
28489,28490,Cymbeline,5.0,1.1.13,First Gentleman,"He that hath lost her too, so is the queen,"
28490,28491,Cymbeline,5.0,1.1.14,First Gentleman,"That most desired the match, but not a courtier,"
28491,28492,Cymbeline,5.0,1.1.15,First Gentleman,Although they wear their faces to the bent
28492,28493,Cymbeline,5.0,1.1.16,First Gentleman,"Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not"
28493,28494,Cymbeline,5.0,1.1.17,First Gentleman,Glad at the thing they scowl at.
28494,28495,Cymbeline,6.0,1.1.18,Second Gentleman,And why so?
28495,28496,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.19,First Gentleman,He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
28496,28497,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.20,First Gentleman,Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
28497,28498,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.21,First Gentleman,"I mean, that married her, alack, good man!"
28498,28499,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.22,First Gentleman,And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
28499,28500,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.23,First Gentleman,"As, to seek through the regions of the earth"
28500,28501,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.24,First Gentleman,"For one his like, there would be something failing"
28501,28502,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.25,First Gentleman,In him that should compare. I do not think
28502,28503,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.26,First Gentleman,So fair an outward and such stuff within
28503,28504,Cymbeline,7.0,1.1.27,First Gentleman,Endows a man but he.
28504,28505,Cymbeline,8.0,1.1.28,Second Gentleman,You speak him far.
28505,28506,Cymbeline,9.0,1.1.29,First Gentleman,"I do extend him, sir, within himself,"
28506,28507,Cymbeline,9.0,1.1.30,First Gentleman,Crush him together rather than unfold
28507,28508,Cymbeline,9.0,1.1.31,First Gentleman,His measure duly.
28508,28509,Cymbeline,10.0,1.1.32,Second Gentleman,What's his name and birth?
28509,28510,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.33,First Gentleman,I cannot delve him to the root: his father
28510,28511,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.34,First Gentleman,"Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour"
28511,28512,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.35,First Gentleman,"Against the Romans with Cassibelan,"
28512,28513,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.36,First Gentleman,But had his titles by Tenantius whom
28513,28514,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.37,First Gentleman,"He served with glory and admired success,"
28514,28515,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.38,First Gentleman,"So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus,"
28515,28516,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.39,First Gentleman,"And had, besides this gentleman in question,"
28516,28517,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.40,First Gentleman,"Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time"
28517,28518,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.41,First Gentleman,"Died with their swords in hand, for which"
28518,28519,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.42,First Gentleman,"their father,"
28519,28520,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.43,First Gentleman,"Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow"
28520,28521,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.44,First Gentleman,"That he quit being, and his gentle lady,"
28521,28522,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.45,First Gentleman,"Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased"
28522,28523,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.46,First Gentleman,As he was born. The king he takes the babe
28523,28524,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.47,First Gentleman,"To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,"
28524,28525,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.48,First Gentleman,"Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,"
28525,28526,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.49,First Gentleman,Puts to him all the learnings that his time
28526,28527,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.50,First Gentleman,"Could make him the receiver of, which he took,"
28527,28528,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.51,First Gentleman,"As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,"
28528,28529,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.52,First Gentleman,"And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--"
28529,28530,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.53,First Gentleman,"Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,"
28530,28531,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.54,First Gentleman,"A sample to the youngest, to the more mature"
28531,28532,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.55,First Gentleman,"A glass that feated them, and to the graver"
28532,28533,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.56,First Gentleman,"A child that guided dotards, to his mistress,"
28533,28534,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.57,First Gentleman,"For whom he now is banish'd, her own price"
28534,28535,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.58,First Gentleman,"Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue,"
28535,28536,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.59,First Gentleman,By her election may be truly read
28536,28537,Cymbeline,11.0,1.1.60,First Gentleman,What kind of man he is.
28537,28538,Cymbeline,12.0,1.1.61,Second Gentleman,I honour him
28538,28539,Cymbeline,12.0,1.1.62,Second Gentleman,"Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,"
28539,28540,Cymbeline,12.0,1.1.63,Second Gentleman,Is she sole child to the king?
28540,28541,Cymbeline,13.0,1.1.64,First Gentleman,His only child.
28541,28542,Cymbeline,13.0,1.1.65,First Gentleman,"He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,"
28542,28543,Cymbeline,13.0,1.1.66,First Gentleman,"Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,"
28543,28544,Cymbeline,13.0,1.1.67,First Gentleman,"I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery"
28544,28545,Cymbeline,13.0,1.1.68,First Gentleman,"Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge"
28545,28546,Cymbeline,13.0,1.1.69,First Gentleman,Which way they went.
28546,28547,Cymbeline,14.0,1.1.70,Second Gentleman,How long is this ago?
28547,28548,Cymbeline,15.0,1.1.71,First Gentleman,Some twenty years.
28548,28549,Cymbeline,16.0,1.1.72,Second Gentleman,"That a king's children should be so convey'd,"
28549,28550,Cymbeline,16.0,1.1.73,Second Gentleman,"So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,"
28550,28551,Cymbeline,16.0,1.1.74,Second Gentleman,That could not trace them!
28551,28552,Cymbeline,17.0,1.1.75,First Gentleman,"Howsoe'er 'tis strange,"
28552,28553,Cymbeline,17.0,1.1.76,First Gentleman,"Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,"
28553,28554,Cymbeline,17.0,1.1.77,First Gentleman,"Yet is it true, sir."
28554,28555,Cymbeline,18.0,1.1.78,Second Gentleman,I do well believe you.
28555,28556,Cymbeline,19.0,1.1.79,First Gentleman,"We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,"
28556,28557,Cymbeline,19.0,1.1.80,First Gentleman,"The queen, and princess."
28557,28558,Cymbeline,19.0,,First Gentleman,Exeunt
28558,28559,Cymbeline,19.0,,First Gentleman,"Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN"
28559,28560,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.81,QUEEN,"No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,"
28560,28561,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.82,QUEEN,"After the slander of most stepmothers,"
28561,28562,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.83,QUEEN,"Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but"
28562,28563,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.84,QUEEN,Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
28563,28564,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.85,QUEEN,"That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,"
28564,28565,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.86,QUEEN,"So soon as I can win the offended king,"
28565,28566,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.87,QUEEN,"I will be known your advocate: marry, yet"
28566,28567,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.88,QUEEN,"The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good"
28567,28568,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.89,QUEEN,You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
28568,28569,Cymbeline,20.0,1.1.90,QUEEN,Your wisdom may inform you.
28569,28570,Cymbeline,21.0,1.1.91,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Please your highness,"
28570,28571,Cymbeline,21.0,1.1.92,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I will from hence to-day.
28571,28572,Cymbeline,22.0,1.1.93,QUEEN,You know the peril.
28572,28573,Cymbeline,22.0,1.1.94,QUEEN,"I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying"
28573,28574,Cymbeline,22.0,1.1.95,QUEEN,"The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king"
28574,28575,Cymbeline,22.0,1.1.96,QUEEN,Hath charged you should not speak together.
28575,28576,Cymbeline,22.0,,QUEEN,Exit
28576,28577,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.97,IMOGEN,O
28577,28578,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.98,IMOGEN,Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
28578,28579,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.99,IMOGEN,"Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,"
28579,28580,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.100,IMOGEN,"I something fear my father's wrath, but nothing--"
28580,28581,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.101,IMOGEN,Always reserved my holy duty--what
28581,28582,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.102,IMOGEN,"His rage can do on me: you must be gone,"
28582,28583,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.103,IMOGEN,And I shall here abide the hourly shot
28583,28584,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.104,IMOGEN,"Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,"
28584,28585,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.105,IMOGEN,But that there is this jewel in the world
28585,28586,Cymbeline,23.0,1.1.106,IMOGEN,That I may see again.
28586,28587,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.107,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,My queen! my mistress!
28587,28588,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.108,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause"
28588,28589,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.109,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To be suspected of more tenderness
28589,28590,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.110,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Than doth become a man. I will remain
28590,28591,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.111,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
28591,28592,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.112,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"My residence in Rome at one Philario's,"
28592,28593,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.113,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who to my father was a friend, to me"
28593,28594,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.114,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,"
28594,28595,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.115,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,"
28595,28596,Cymbeline,24.0,1.1.116,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Though ink be made of gall.
28596,28597,Cymbeline,24.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Re-enter QUEEN
28597,28598,Cymbeline,25.0,1.1.117,QUEEN,"Be brief, I pray you:"
28598,28599,Cymbeline,25.0,1.1.118,QUEEN,"If the king come, I shall incur I know not"
28599,28600,Cymbeline,25.0,1.1.119,QUEEN,How much of his displeasure.
28600,28601,Cymbeline,25.0,,QUEEN,Aside
28601,28602,Cymbeline,25.0,1.1.120,QUEEN,Yet I'll move him
28602,28603,Cymbeline,25.0,1.1.121,QUEEN,"To walk this way: I never do him wrong,"
28603,28604,Cymbeline,25.0,1.1.122,QUEEN,"But he does buy my injuries, to be friends,"
28604,28605,Cymbeline,25.0,1.1.123,QUEEN,Pays dear for my offences.
28605,28606,Cymbeline,25.0,,QUEEN,Exit
28606,28607,Cymbeline,26.0,1.1.124,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Should we be taking leave
28607,28608,Cymbeline,26.0,1.1.125,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As long a term as yet we have to live,"
28608,28609,Cymbeline,26.0,1.1.126,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
28609,28610,Cymbeline,27.0,1.1.127,IMOGEN,"Nay, stay a little:"
28610,28611,Cymbeline,27.0,1.1.128,IMOGEN,"Were you but riding forth to air yourself,"
28611,28612,Cymbeline,27.0,1.1.129,IMOGEN,"Such parting were too petty. Look here, love,"
28612,28613,Cymbeline,27.0,1.1.130,IMOGEN,"This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart,"
28613,28614,Cymbeline,27.0,1.1.131,IMOGEN,"But keep it till you woo another wife,"
28614,28615,Cymbeline,27.0,1.1.132,IMOGEN,When Imogen is dead.
28615,28616,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.133,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"How, how! another?"
28616,28617,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.134,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You gentle gods, give me but this I have,"
28617,28618,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.135,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And sear up my embracements from a next
28618,28619,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.136,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,With bonds of death!
28619,28620,Cymbeline,28.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Putting on the ring
28620,28621,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.137,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Remain, remain thou here"
28621,28622,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.138,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,"
28622,28623,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.139,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As I my poor self did exchange for you,"
28623,28624,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.140,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles"
28624,28625,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.141,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I still win of you: for my sake wear this,"
28625,28626,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.142,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is a manacle of love, I'll place it"
28626,28627,Cymbeline,28.0,1.1.143,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Upon this fairest prisoner.
28627,28628,Cymbeline,28.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Putting a bracelet upon her arm
28628,28629,Cymbeline,29.0,1.1.144,IMOGEN,O the gods!
28629,28630,Cymbeline,29.0,1.1.145,IMOGEN,When shall we see again?
28630,28631,Cymbeline,29.0,,IMOGEN,Enter CYMBELINE and Lords
28631,28632,Cymbeline,30.0,1.1.146,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Alack, the king!"
28632,28633,Cymbeline,31.0,1.1.147,CYMBELINE,"Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!"
28633,28634,Cymbeline,31.0,1.1.148,CYMBELINE,If after this command thou fraught the court
28634,28635,Cymbeline,31.0,1.1.149,CYMBELINE,"With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!"
28635,28636,Cymbeline,31.0,1.1.150,CYMBELINE,Thou'rt poison to my blood.
28636,28637,Cymbeline,32.0,1.1.151,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The gods protect you!
28637,28638,Cymbeline,32.0,1.1.152,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
28638,28639,Cymbeline,32.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Exit
28639,28640,Cymbeline,33.0,1.1.153,IMOGEN,There cannot be a pinch in death
28640,28641,Cymbeline,33.0,1.1.154,IMOGEN,More sharp than this is.
28641,28642,Cymbeline,34.0,1.1.155,CYMBELINE,"O disloyal thing,"
28642,28643,Cymbeline,34.0,1.1.156,CYMBELINE,"That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st"
28643,28644,Cymbeline,34.0,1.1.157,CYMBELINE,A year's age on me.
28644,28645,Cymbeline,35.0,1.1.158,IMOGEN,"I beseech you, sir,"
28645,28646,Cymbeline,35.0,1.1.159,IMOGEN,Harm not yourself with your vexation
28646,28647,Cymbeline,35.0,1.1.160,IMOGEN,"I am senseless of your wrath, a touch more rare"
28647,28648,Cymbeline,35.0,1.1.161,IMOGEN,"Subdues all pangs, all fears."
28648,28649,Cymbeline,36.0,1.1.162,CYMBELINE,Past grace? obedience?
28649,28650,Cymbeline,37.0,1.1.163,IMOGEN,"Past hope, and in despair, that way, past grace."
28650,28651,Cymbeline,38.0,1.1.164,CYMBELINE,That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
28651,28652,Cymbeline,39.0,1.1.165,IMOGEN,"O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,"
28652,28653,Cymbeline,39.0,1.1.166,IMOGEN,And did avoid a puttock.
28653,28654,Cymbeline,40.0,1.1.167,CYMBELINE,"Thou took'st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne"
28654,28655,Cymbeline,40.0,1.1.168,CYMBELINE,A seat for baseness.
28655,28656,Cymbeline,41.0,1.1.169,IMOGEN,"No, I rather added"
28656,28657,Cymbeline,41.0,1.1.170,IMOGEN,A lustre to it.
28657,28658,Cymbeline,42.0,1.1.171,CYMBELINE,O thou vile one!

28659,28660,Cymbeline,43.0,1.1.173,IMOGEN,It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
28660,28661,Cymbeline,43.0,1.1.174,IMOGEN,"You bred him as my playfellow, and he is"
28661,28662,Cymbeline,43.0,1.1.175,IMOGEN,"A man worth any woman, overbuys me"
28662,28663,Cymbeline,43.0,1.1.176,IMOGEN,Almost the sum he pays.
28663,28664,Cymbeline,44.0,1.1.177,CYMBELINE,"What, art thou mad?"
28664,28665,Cymbeline,45.0,1.1.178,IMOGEN,"Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were"
28665,28666,Cymbeline,45.0,1.1.179,IMOGEN,"A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus"
28666,28667,Cymbeline,45.0,1.1.180,IMOGEN,Our neighbour shepherd's son!

28669,28670,Cymbeline,46.0,1.1.182,CYMBELINE,They were again together: you have done
28670,28671,Cymbeline,46.0,1.1.183,CYMBELINE,"Not after our command. Away with her,"
28671,28672,Cymbeline,46.0,1.1.184,CYMBELINE,And pen her up.
28672,28673,Cymbeline,47.0,1.1.185,QUEEN,"Beseech your patience. Peace,"
28673,28674,Cymbeline,47.0,1.1.186,QUEEN,"Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,"
28674,28675,Cymbeline,47.0,1.1.187,QUEEN,"Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort"
28675,28676,Cymbeline,47.0,1.1.188,QUEEN,Out of your best advice.
28676,28677,Cymbeline,48.0,1.1.189,CYMBELINE,"Nay, let her languish"

28683,28684,Cymbeline,50.0,1.1.194,PISANIO,My lord your son drew on my master.
28684,28685,Cymbeline,51.0,1.1.195,QUEEN,Ha!
28685,28686,Cymbeline,51.0,1.1.196,QUEEN,"No harm, I trust, is done?"
28686,28687,Cymbeline,52.0,1.1.197,PISANIO,"There might have been,"
28687,28688,Cymbeline,52.0,1.1.198,PISANIO,But that my master rather play'd than fought
28688,28689,Cymbeline,52.0,1.1.199,PISANIO,And had no help of anger: they were parted
28689,28690,Cymbeline,52.0,1.1.200,PISANIO,By gentlemen at hand.
28690,28691,Cymbeline,53.0,1.1.201,QUEEN,I am very glad on't.
28691,28692,Cymbeline,54.0,1.1.202,IMOGEN,"Your son's my father's friend, he takes his part."
28692,28693,Cymbeline,54.0,1.1.203,IMOGEN,To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
28693,28694,Cymbeline,54.0,1.1.204,IMOGEN,"I would they were in Afric both together,"
28694,28695,Cymbeline,54.0,1.1.205,IMOGEN,"Myself by with a needle, that I might prick"
28695,28696,Cymbeline,54.0,1.1.206,IMOGEN,The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
28696,28697,Cymbeline,55.0,1.1.207,PISANIO,On his command: he would not suffer me
28697,28698,Cymbeline,55.0,1.1.208,PISANIO,"To bring him to the haven, left these notes"
28698,28699,Cymbeline,55.0,1.1.209,PISANIO,"Of what commands I should be subject to,"
28699,28700,Cymbeline,55.0,1.1.210,PISANIO,When 't pleased you to employ me.
28700,28701,Cymbeline,56.0,1.1.211,QUEEN,This hath been
28701,28702,Cymbeline,56.0,1.1.212,QUEEN,Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour

28703,28704,Cymbeline,57.0,1.1.214,PISANIO,I humbly thank your highness.

28710,28711,Cymbeline,59.0,,IMOGEN,Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
28711,28712,Cymbeline,1.0,1.2.1,First Lord,"Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt, the"
28712,28713,Cymbeline,1.0,1.2.2,First Lord,violence of action hath made you reek as a
28713,28714,Cymbeline,1.0,1.2.3,First Lord,"sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:"
28714,28715,Cymbeline,1.0,1.2.4,First Lord,there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
28715,28716,Cymbeline,2.0,1.2.5,CLOTEN,"If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?"
28716,28717,Cymbeline,3.0,1.2.6,Second Lord,"[Aside]  No, 'faith, not so much as his patience."
28717,28718,Cymbeline,4.0,1.2.7,First Lord,"Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be"
28718,28719,Cymbeline,4.0,1.2.8,First Lord,"not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt."
28719,28720,Cymbeline,5.0,1.2.9,Second Lord,"[Aside]  His steel was in debt, it went o' the"
28720,28721,Cymbeline,5.0,1.2.10,Second Lord,backside the town.
28721,28722,Cymbeline,6.0,1.2.11,CLOTEN,The villain would not stand me.
28722,28723,Cymbeline,7.0,1.2.12,Second Lord,"[Aside]  No, but he fled forward still, toward your face."
28723,28724,Cymbeline,8.0,1.2.13,First Lord,Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
28724,28725,Cymbeline,8.0,1.2.14,First Lord,"he added to your having, gave you some ground."
28725,28726,Cymbeline,9.0,1.2.15,Second Lord,[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
28726,28727,Cymbeline,10.0,1.2.16,CLOTEN,I would they had not come between us.
28727,28728,Cymbeline,11.0,1.2.17,Second Lord,"[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long"
28728,28729,Cymbeline,11.0,1.2.18,Second Lord,a fool you were upon the ground.
28729,28730,Cymbeline,12.0,1.2.19,CLOTEN,And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
28730,28731,Cymbeline,13.0,1.2.20,Second Lord,"[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she"
28731,28732,Cymbeline,13.0,1.2.21,Second Lord,is damned.
28732,28733,Cymbeline,14.0,1.2.22,First Lord,"Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain"
28733,28734,Cymbeline,14.0,1.2.23,First Lord,"go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen"
28734,28735,Cymbeline,14.0,1.2.24,First Lord,small reflection of her wit.
28735,28736,Cymbeline,15.0,1.2.25,Second Lord,"[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the"
28736,28737,Cymbeline,15.0,1.2.26,Second Lord,reflection should hurt her.
28737,28738,Cymbeline,16.0,1.2.27,CLOTEN,"Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some"
28738,28739,Cymbeline,16.0,1.2.28,CLOTEN,hurt done!
28739,28740,Cymbeline,17.0,1.2.29,Second Lord,"[Aside]  I wish not so, unless it had been the fall"
28740,28741,Cymbeline,17.0,1.2.30,Second Lord,"of an ass, which is no great hurt."
28741,28742,Cymbeline,18.0,1.2.31,CLOTEN,You'll go with us?
28742,28743,Cymbeline,19.0,1.2.32,First Lord,I'll attend your lordship.
28743,28744,Cymbeline,20.0,1.2.33,CLOTEN,"Nay, come, let's go together."
28744,28745,Cymbeline,21.0,1.2.34,Second Lord,"Well, my lord."

28749,28750,Cymbeline,1.0,1.3.2,IMOGEN,And question'dst every sail: if he should write
28750,28751,Cymbeline,1.0,1.3.3,IMOGEN,"And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,"
28751,28752,Cymbeline,1.0,1.3.4,IMOGEN,As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
28752,28753,Cymbeline,1.0,1.3.5,IMOGEN,That he spake to thee?
28753,28754,Cymbeline,2.0,1.3.6,PISANIO,"It was his queen, his queen!"
28754,28755,Cymbeline,3.0,1.3.7,IMOGEN,Then waved his handkerchief?
28755,28756,Cymbeline,4.0,1.3.8,PISANIO,"And kiss'd it, madam."
28756,28757,Cymbeline,5.0,1.3.9,IMOGEN,Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
28757,28758,Cymbeline,5.0,1.3.10,IMOGEN,And that was all?
28758,28759,Cymbeline,6.0,1.3.11,PISANIO,"No, madam, for so long"
28759,28760,Cymbeline,6.0,1.3.12,PISANIO,As he could make me with this eye or ear
28760,28761,Cymbeline,6.0,1.3.13,PISANIO,"Distinguish him from others, he did keep"
28761,28762,Cymbeline,6.0,1.3.14,PISANIO,"The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,"
28762,28763,Cymbeline,6.0,1.3.15,PISANIO,"Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind"
28763,28764,Cymbeline,6.0,1.3.16,PISANIO,"Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,"
28764,28765,Cymbeline,6.0,1.3.17,PISANIO,How swift his ship.
28765,28766,Cymbeline,7.0,1.3.18,IMOGEN,Thou shouldst have made him
28766,28767,Cymbeline,7.0,1.3.19,IMOGEN,"As little as a crow, or less, ere left"
28767,28768,Cymbeline,7.0,1.3.20,IMOGEN,To after-eye him.
28768,28769,Cymbeline,8.0,1.3.21,PISANIO,"Madam, so I did."
28769,28770,Cymbeline,9.0,1.3.22,IMOGEN,"I would have broke mine eye-strings, crack'd them, but"
28770,28771,Cymbeline,9.0,1.3.23,IMOGEN,"To look upon him, till the diminution"
28771,28772,Cymbeline,9.0,1.3.24,IMOGEN,"Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,"
28772,28773,Cymbeline,9.0,1.3.25,IMOGEN,"Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from"
28773,28774,Cymbeline,9.0,1.3.26,IMOGEN,"The smallness of a gnat to air, and then"
28774,28775,Cymbeline,9.0,1.3.27,IMOGEN,"Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,"
28775,28776,Cymbeline,9.0,1.3.28,IMOGEN,When shall we hear from him?
28776,28777,Cymbeline,10.0,1.3.29,PISANIO,"Be assured, madam,"
28777,28778,Cymbeline,10.0,1.3.30,PISANIO,With his next vantage.
28778,28779,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.31,IMOGEN,"I did not take my leave of him, but had"
28779,28780,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.32,IMOGEN,Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
28780,28781,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.33,IMOGEN,How I would think on him at certain hours
28781,28782,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.34,IMOGEN,"Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear"
28782,28783,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.35,IMOGEN,The shes of Italy should not betray
28783,28784,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.36,IMOGEN,"Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,"
28784,28785,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.37,IMOGEN,"At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,"
28785,28786,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.38,IMOGEN,"To encounter me with orisons, for then"
28786,28787,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.39,IMOGEN,"I am in heaven for him, or ere I could"
28787,28788,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.40,IMOGEN,Give him that parting kiss which I had set
28788,28789,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.41,IMOGEN,"Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father"
28789,28790,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.42,IMOGEN,And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
28790,28791,Cymbeline,11.0,1.3.43,IMOGEN,Shakes all our buds from growing.
28791,28792,Cymbeline,11.0,,IMOGEN,Enter a Lady
28792,28793,Cymbeline,12.0,1.3.44,Lady,"The queen, madam,"
28793,28794,Cymbeline,12.0,1.3.45,Lady,Desires your highness' company.
28794,28795,Cymbeline,13.0,1.3.46,IMOGEN,"Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd."
28795,28796,Cymbeline,13.0,1.3.47,IMOGEN,I will attend the queen.
28796,28797,Cymbeline,14.0,1.3.48,PISANIO,"Madam, I shall."
28797,28798,Cymbeline,14.0,,PISANIO,Exeunt
28798,28799,Cymbeline,14.0,,PISANIO,SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.
28799,28800,Cymbeline,14.0,,PISANIO,"Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard"
28800,28801,Cymbeline,1.0,1.4.1,IACHIMO,"Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was"
28801,28802,Cymbeline,1.0,1.4.2,IACHIMO,"then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy"
28802,28803,Cymbeline,1.0,1.4.3,IACHIMO,"as since he hath been allowed the name of, but I"
28803,28804,Cymbeline,1.0,1.4.4,IACHIMO,could then have looked on him without the help of
28804,28805,Cymbeline,1.0,1.4.5,IACHIMO,"admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments"
28805,28806,Cymbeline,1.0,1.4.6,IACHIMO,had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
28806,28807,Cymbeline,2.0,1.4.7,PHILARIO,You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
28807,28808,Cymbeline,2.0,1.4.8,PHILARIO,he is with that which makes him both without and within.
28808,28809,Cymbeline,3.0,1.4.9,Frenchman,I have seen him in France: we had very many there
28809,28810,Cymbeline,3.0,1.4.10,Frenchman,could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
28810,28811,Cymbeline,4.0,1.4.11,IACHIMO,"This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein"
28811,28812,Cymbeline,4.0,1.4.12,IACHIMO,"he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,"
28812,28813,Cymbeline,4.0,1.4.13,IACHIMO,"words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter."
28813,28814,Cymbeline,5.0,1.4.14,Frenchman,And then his banishment.
28814,28815,Cymbeline,6.0,1.4.15,IACHIMO,"Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this"
28815,28816,Cymbeline,6.0,1.4.16,IACHIMO,lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
28816,28817,Cymbeline,6.0,1.4.17,IACHIMO,"to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment,"
28817,28818,Cymbeline,6.0,1.4.18,IACHIMO,"which else an easy battery might lay flat, for"
28818,28819,Cymbeline,6.0,1.4.19,IACHIMO,taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
28819,28820,Cymbeline,6.0,1.4.20,IACHIMO,it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
28820,28821,Cymbeline,6.0,1.4.21,IACHIMO,acquaintance?
28821,28822,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.22,PHILARIO,"His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I"
28822,28823,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.23,PHILARIO,have been often bound for no less than my life.
28823,28824,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.24,PHILARIO,Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
28824,28825,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.25,PHILARIO,"amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your"
28825,28826,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.26,PHILARIO,"knowing, to a stranger of his quality."
28826,28827,Cymbeline,7.0,,PHILARIO,Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
28827,28828,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.27,PHILARIO,"I beseech you all, be better known to this"
28828,28829,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.28,PHILARIO,"gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend"
28829,28830,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.29,PHILARIO,of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
28830,28831,Cymbeline,7.0,1.4.30,PHILARIO,"hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing."
28831,28832,Cymbeline,8.0,1.4.31,Frenchman,"Sir, we have known together in Orleans."
28832,28833,Cymbeline,9.0,1.4.32,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,"
28833,28834,Cymbeline,9.0,1.4.33,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
28834,28835,Cymbeline,10.0,1.4.34,Frenchman,"Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I"
28835,28836,Cymbeline,10.0,1.4.35,Frenchman,"did atone my countryman and you, it had been pity"
28836,28837,Cymbeline,10.0,1.4.36,Frenchman,you should have been put together with so mortal a
28837,28838,Cymbeline,10.0,1.4.37,Frenchman,"purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so"
28838,28839,Cymbeline,10.0,1.4.38,Frenchman,slight and trivial a nature.
28839,28840,Cymbeline,11.0,1.4.39,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller,"
28840,28841,Cymbeline,11.0,1.4.40,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
28841,28842,Cymbeline,11.0,1.4.41,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
28842,28843,Cymbeline,11.0,1.4.42,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
28843,28844,Cymbeline,11.0,1.4.43,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
28844,28845,Cymbeline,12.0,1.4.44,Frenchman,"'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,"
28845,28846,Cymbeline,12.0,1.4.45,Frenchman,and by such two that would by all likelihood have
28846,28847,Cymbeline,12.0,1.4.46,Frenchman,"confounded one the other, or have fallen both."
28847,28848,Cymbeline,13.0,1.4.47,IACHIMO,"Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?"
28848,28849,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.48,Frenchman,"Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,"
28849,28850,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.49,Frenchman,"which may, without contradiction, suffer the report."
28850,28851,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.50,Frenchman,It was much like an argument that fell out last
28851,28852,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.51,Frenchman,"night, where each of us fell in praise of our"
28852,28853,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.52,Frenchman,"country mistresses, this gentleman at that time"
28853,28854,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.53,Frenchman,vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
28854,28855,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.54,Frenchman,"affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,"
28855,28856,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.55,Frenchman,"chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable"
28856,28857,Cymbeline,14.0,1.4.56,Frenchman,than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
28857,28858,Cymbeline,15.0,1.4.57,IACHIMO,"That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's"
28858,28859,Cymbeline,15.0,1.4.58,IACHIMO,opinion by this worn out.
28859,28860,Cymbeline,16.0,1.4.59,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
28860,28861,Cymbeline,17.0,1.4.60,IACHIMO,You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
28861,28862,Cymbeline,18.0,1.4.61,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would"
28862,28863,Cymbeline,18.0,1.4.62,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"abate her nothing, though I profess myself her"
28863,28864,Cymbeline,18.0,1.4.63,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"adorer, not her friend."
28864,28865,Cymbeline,19.0,1.4.64,IACHIMO,As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
28865,28866,Cymbeline,19.0,1.4.65,IACHIMO,comparison--had been something too fair and too good
28866,28867,Cymbeline,19.0,1.4.66,IACHIMO,for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
28867,28868,Cymbeline,19.0,1.4.67,IACHIMO,"I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres"
28868,28869,Cymbeline,19.0,1.4.68,IACHIMO,many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
28869,28870,Cymbeline,19.0,1.4.69,IACHIMO,excelled many: but I have not seen the most
28870,28871,Cymbeline,19.0,1.4.70,IACHIMO,"precious diamond that is, nor you the lady."
28871,28872,Cymbeline,20.0,1.4.71,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
28872,28873,Cymbeline,21.0,1.4.72,IACHIMO,What do you esteem it at?
28873,28874,Cymbeline,22.0,1.4.73,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,More than the world enjoys.
28874,28875,Cymbeline,23.0,1.4.74,IACHIMO,"Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's"
28875,28876,Cymbeline,23.0,1.4.75,IACHIMO,outprized by a trifle.
28876,28877,Cymbeline,24.0,1.4.76,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if"
28877,28878,Cymbeline,24.0,1.4.77,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit"
28878,28879,Cymbeline,24.0,1.4.78,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,"
28879,28880,Cymbeline,24.0,1.4.79,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,and only the gift of the gods.
28880,28881,Cymbeline,25.0,1.4.80,IACHIMO,Which the gods have given you?
28881,28882,Cymbeline,26.0,1.4.81,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which, by their graces, I will keep."
28882,28883,Cymbeline,27.0,1.4.82,IACHIMO,"You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,"
28883,28884,Cymbeline,27.0,1.4.83,IACHIMO,strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
28884,28885,Cymbeline,27.0,1.4.84,IACHIMO,ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
28885,28886,Cymbeline,27.0,1.4.85,IACHIMO,"estimations, the one is but frail and the other"
28886,28887,Cymbeline,27.0,1.4.86,IACHIMO,"casual, a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished"
28887,28888,Cymbeline,27.0,1.4.87,IACHIMO,"courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last."
28888,28889,Cymbeline,28.0,1.4.88,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
28889,28890,Cymbeline,28.0,1.4.89,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the"
28890,28891,Cymbeline,28.0,1.4.90,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do"
28891,28892,Cymbeline,28.0,1.4.91,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"nothing doubt you have store of thieves,"
28892,28893,Cymbeline,28.0,1.4.92,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"notwithstanding, I fear not my ring."
28893,28894,Cymbeline,29.0,1.4.93,PHILARIO,"Let us leave here, gentlemen."
28894,28895,Cymbeline,30.0,1.4.94,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I"
28895,28896,Cymbeline,30.0,1.4.95,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"thank him, makes no stranger of me, we are familiar at first."
28896,28897,Cymbeline,31.0,1.4.96,IACHIMO,"With five times so much conversation, I should get"

28899,28900,Cymbeline,32.0,1.4.99,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No, no."
28900,28901,Cymbeline,33.0,1.4.100,IACHIMO,I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
28901,28902,Cymbeline,33.0,1.4.101,IACHIMO,"your ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it"
28902,28903,Cymbeline,33.0,1.4.102,IACHIMO,something: but I make my wager rather against your
28903,28904,Cymbeline,33.0,1.4.103,IACHIMO,"confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your"
28904,28905,Cymbeline,33.0,1.4.104,IACHIMO,"offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any"
28905,28906,Cymbeline,33.0,1.4.105,IACHIMO,lady in the world.
28906,28907,Cymbeline,34.0,1.4.106,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,You are a great deal abused in too bold a

28908,28909,Cymbeline,34.0,1.4.108,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,worthy of by your attempt.
28909,28910,Cymbeline,35.0,1.4.109,IACHIMO,What's that?
28910,28911,Cymbeline,36.0,1.4.110,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,"
28911,28912,Cymbeline,36.0,1.4.111,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"deserve more, a punishment too."
28912,28913,Cymbeline,37.0,1.4.112,PHILARIO,"Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly,"
28913,28914,Cymbeline,37.0,1.4.113,PHILARIO,"let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be"
28914,28915,Cymbeline,37.0,1.4.114,PHILARIO,better acquainted.
28915,28916,Cymbeline,38.0,1.4.115,IACHIMO,Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
28916,28917,Cymbeline,38.0,1.4.116,IACHIMO,approbation of what I have spoke!
28917,28918,Cymbeline,39.0,1.4.117,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,What lady would you choose to assail?
28918,28919,Cymbeline,40.0,1.4.118,IACHIMO,"Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe."
28919,28920,Cymbeline,40.0,1.4.119,IACHIMO,"I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,"
28920,28921,Cymbeline,40.0,1.4.120,IACHIMO,"that, commend me to the court where your lady is,"
28921,28922,Cymbeline,40.0,1.4.121,IACHIMO,with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
28922,28923,Cymbeline,40.0,1.4.122,IACHIMO,"second conference, and I will bring from thence"
28923,28924,Cymbeline,40.0,1.4.123,IACHIMO,that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
28924,28925,Cymbeline,41.0,1.4.124,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring"
28925,28926,Cymbeline,41.0,1.4.125,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I hold dear as my finger, 'tis part of it."
28926,28927,Cymbeline,42.0,1.4.126,IACHIMO,"You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy"
28927,28928,Cymbeline,42.0,1.4.127,IACHIMO,"ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot"
28928,28929,Cymbeline,42.0,1.4.128,IACHIMO,preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
28929,28930,Cymbeline,42.0,1.4.129,IACHIMO,"religion in you, that you fear."
28930,28931,Cymbeline,43.0,1.4.130,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is but a custom in your tongue, you bear a"

28932,28933,Cymbeline,44.0,1.4.132,IACHIMO,"I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo"
28933,28934,Cymbeline,44.0,1.4.133,IACHIMO,"what's spoken, I swear."
28934,28935,Cymbeline,45.0,1.4.134,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
28935,28936,Cymbeline,45.0,1.4.135,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
28936,28937,Cymbeline,45.0,1.4.136,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
28937,28938,Cymbeline,45.0,1.4.137,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
28938,28939,Cymbeline,46.0,1.4.138,PHILARIO,I will have it no lay.
28939,28940,Cymbeline,47.0,1.4.139,IACHIMO,"By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no"
28940,28941,Cymbeline,47.0,1.4.140,IACHIMO,sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest

28942,28943,Cymbeline,47.0,1.4.142,IACHIMO,"are yours, so is your diamond too: if I come off,"
28943,28944,Cymbeline,47.0,1.4.143,IACHIMO,"and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,"
28944,28945,Cymbeline,47.0,1.4.144,IACHIMO,"she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are"
28945,28946,Cymbeline,47.0,1.4.145,IACHIMO,yours: provided I have your commendation for my more

29022,29023,Cymbeline,10.0,1.5.50,CORNELIUS,"With a most false effect, and I the truer,"
29023,29024,Cymbeline,10.0,1.5.51,CORNELIUS,So to be false with her.
29024,29025,Cymbeline,11.0,1.5.52,QUEEN,"No further service, doctor,"
29025,29026,Cymbeline,11.0,1.5.53,QUEEN,Until I send for thee.
29026,29027,Cymbeline,12.0,1.5.54,CORNELIUS,I humbly take my leave.

29032,29033,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.59,QUEEN,I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then

29037,29038,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.64,QUEEN,"Is to exchange one misery with another,"
29038,29039,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.65,QUEEN,And every day that comes comes to decay
29039,29040,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.66,QUEEN,"A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,"
29040,29041,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.67,QUEEN,"To be depender on a thing that leans,"

29043,29044,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.69,QUEEN,The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up
29044,29045,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.70,QUEEN,Thou takest up
29045,29046,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.71,QUEEN,"Thou know'st not what, but take it for thy labour:"

29049,29050,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.75,QUEEN,It is an earnest of a further good
29050,29051,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.76,QUEEN,That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
29051,29052,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.77,QUEEN,"The case stands with her, do't as from thyself."

29058,29059,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.84,QUEEN,To load thy merit richly. Call my women:

29064,29065,Cymbeline,13.0,1.5.89,QUEEN,The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that

29084,29085,Cymbeline,1.0,1.6.4,IMOGEN,My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated

29086,29087,Cymbeline,1.0,1.6.6,IMOGEN,"As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable"
29087,29088,Cymbeline,1.0,1.6.7,IMOGEN,"Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,"

29089,29090,Cymbeline,1.0,1.6.9,IMOGEN,Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

29104,29105,Cymbeline,5.0,1.6.22,IACHIMO,"Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight,"
29105,29106,Cymbeline,5.0,1.6.23,IACHIMO,Rather directly fly.
29106,29107,Cymbeline,6.0,1.6.24,IMOGEN,"[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose"

29139,29140,Cymbeline,12.0,1.6.57,IMOGEN,Thus raps you? Are you well?

29144,29145,Cymbeline,13.0,1.6.61,IACHIMO,Is strange and peevish.

29146,29147,Cymbeline,14.0,1.6.63,PISANIO,To give him welcome.

29149,29150,Cymbeline,16.0,1.6.65,IACHIMO,"Well, madam."
29150,29151,Cymbeline,17.0,1.6.66,IMOGEN,Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
29151,29152,Cymbeline,18.0,1.6.67,IACHIMO,"Exceeding pleasant, none a stranger there"
29152,29153,Cymbeline,18.0,1.6.68,IACHIMO,So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
29153,29154,Cymbeline,18.0,1.6.69,IACHIMO,The Briton reveller.

29178,29179,Cymbeline,24.0,1.6.94,IACHIMO,To pity too.
29179,29180,Cymbeline,25.0,1.6.95,IMOGEN,"What do you pity, sir?"
29180,29181,Cymbeline,26.0,1.6.96,IACHIMO,Two creatures heartily.
29181,29182,Cymbeline,27.0,1.6.97,IMOGEN,"Am I one, sir?"
29182,29183,Cymbeline,27.0,1.6.98,IMOGEN,You look on me: what wreck discern you in me

29184,29185,Cymbeline,28.0,1.6.100,IACHIMO,"Lamentable! What,"
29185,29186,Cymbeline,28.0,1.6.101,IACHIMO,To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
29186,29187,Cymbeline,28.0,1.6.102,IACHIMO,I' the dungeon by a snuff?
29187,29188,Cymbeline,29.0,1.6.103,IMOGEN,"I pray you, sir,"

29196,29197,Cymbeline,31.0,1.6.112,IMOGEN,Since doubling things go ill often hurts more

29285,29286,Cymbeline,44.0,1.6.201,IACHIMO,Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him

29290,29291,Cymbeline,46.0,1.6.206,IACHIMO,My humble thanks. I had almost forgot

29315,29316,Cymbeline,52.0,1.6.231,IACHIMO,By lengthening my return. From Gallia

29333,29334,Cymbeline,1.0,2.1.2,CLOTEN,"jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a"
29334,29335,Cymbeline,1.0,2.1.3,CLOTEN,hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
29335,29336,Cymbeline,1.0,2.1.4,CLOTEN,"must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine"
29336,29337,Cymbeline,1.0,2.1.5,CLOTEN,oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
29337,29338,Cymbeline,2.0,2.1.6,First Lord,What got he by that? You have broke his pate with

29339,29340,Cymbeline,3.0,2.1.8,Second Lord,"[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,"
29340,29341,Cymbeline,3.0,2.1.9,Second Lord,it would have run all out.
29341,29342,Cymbeline,4.0,2.1.10,CLOTEN,"When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for"

29349,29350,Cymbeline,8.0,2.1.17,CLOTEN,I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a

29355,29356,Cymbeline,9.0,2.1.23,Second Lord,"[Aside]  You are cock and capon too, and you crow,"
29356,29357,Cymbeline,9.0,2.1.24,Second Lord,"cock, with your comb on."
29357,29358,Cymbeline,10.0,2.1.25,CLOTEN,Sayest thou?
29358,29359,Cymbeline,11.0,2.1.26,Second Lord,It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
29359,29360,Cymbeline,11.0,2.1.27,Second Lord,companion that you give offence to.
29360,29361,Cymbeline,12.0,2.1.28,CLOTEN,"No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit"
29361,29362,Cymbeline,12.0,2.1.29,CLOTEN,offence to my inferiors.
29362,29363,Cymbeline,13.0,2.1.30,Second Lord,"Ay, it is fit for your lordship only."
29363,29364,Cymbeline,14.0,2.1.31,CLOTEN,"Why, so I say."
29364,29365,Cymbeline,15.0,2.1.32,First Lord,Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
29365,29366,Cymbeline,16.0,2.1.33,CLOTEN,"A stranger, and I not know on't!"
29366,29367,Cymbeline,17.0,2.1.34,Second Lord,"[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it"
29367,29368,Cymbeline,17.0,2.1.35,Second Lord,not.
29368,29369,Cymbeline,18.0,2.1.36,First Lord,"There's an Italian come, and, 'tis thought, one of"
29369,29370,Cymbeline,18.0,2.1.37,First Lord,Leonatus' friends.
29370,29371,Cymbeline,19.0,2.1.38,CLOTEN,"Leonatus! a banished rascal, and he's another,"
29371,29372,Cymbeline,19.0,2.1.39,CLOTEN,whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
29372,29373,Cymbeline,20.0,2.1.40,First Lord,One of your lordship's pages.
29373,29374,Cymbeline,21.0,2.1.41,CLOTEN,Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
29374,29375,Cymbeline,21.0,2.1.42,CLOTEN,derogation in't?
29375,29376,Cymbeline,22.0,2.1.43,Second Lord,"You cannot derogate, my lord."
29376,29377,Cymbeline,23.0,2.1.44,CLOTEN,"Not easily, I think."
29377,29378,Cymbeline,24.0,2.1.45,Second Lord,"[Aside]  You are a fool granted, therefore your"

29379,29380,Cymbeline,25.0,2.1.47,CLOTEN,"Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost"
29380,29381,Cymbeline,25.0,2.1.48,CLOTEN,"to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go."
29381,29382,Cymbeline,26.0,2.1.49,Second Lord,I'll attend your lordship.

29399,29400,Cymbeline,26.0,2.2.1,Second Lord,a trunk in one corner of it.
29400,29401,Cymbeline,26.0,2.2.1,Second Lord,"IMOGEN in bed, reading, a Lady attending"
29401,29402,Cymbeline,1.0,2.2.2,IMOGEN,Who's there? my woman Helen?

29403,29404,Cymbeline,3.0,2.2.4,IMOGEN,What hour is it?
29404,29405,Cymbeline,4.0,2.2.5,Lady,"Almost midnight, madam."
29405,29406,Cymbeline,5.0,2.2.6,IMOGEN,I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
29406,29407,Cymbeline,5.0,2.2.7,IMOGEN,Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
29407,29408,Cymbeline,5.0,2.2.8,IMOGEN,"Take not away the taper, leave it burning,"
29408,29409,Cymbeline,5.0,2.2.9,IMOGEN,"And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,"

29416,29417,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.15,IACHIMO,Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus

29418,29419,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.17,IACHIMO,"The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,"

29420,29421,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.19,IACHIMO,And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
29421,29422,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.20,IACHIMO,"But kiss, one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,"
29422,29423,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.21,IACHIMO,How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
29423,29424,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.22,IACHIMO,Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
29424,29425,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.23,IACHIMO,"Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,"
29425,29426,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.24,IACHIMO,"To see the enclosed lights, now canopied"
29426,29427,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.25,IACHIMO,"Under these windows, white and azure laced"
29427,29428,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.26,IACHIMO,"With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,"
29428,29429,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.27,IACHIMO,To note the chamber: I will write all down:
29429,29430,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.28,IACHIMO,"Such and such pictures, there the window, such"
29430,29431,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.29,IACHIMO,"The adornment of her bed, the arras, figures,"
29431,29432,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.30,IACHIMO,"Why, such and such, and the contents o' the story."
29432,29433,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.31,IACHIMO,"Ah, but some natural notes about her body,"
29433,29434,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.32,IACHIMO,Above ten thousand meaner moveables

29435,29436,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.34,IACHIMO,"O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!"
29436,29437,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.35,IACHIMO,"And be her sense but as a monument,"
29437,29438,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.36,IACHIMO,"Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:"
29438,29439,Cymbeline,6.0,,IACHIMO,Taking off her bracelet
29439,29440,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.37,IACHIMO,As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
29440,29441,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.38,IACHIMO,"'Tis mine, and this will witness outwardly,"
29441,29442,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.39,IACHIMO,"As strongly as the conscience does within,"
29442,29443,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.40,IACHIMO,To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
29443,29444,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.41,IACHIMO,"A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops"
29444,29445,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.42,IACHIMO,"I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,"
29445,29446,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.43,IACHIMO,Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
29446,29447,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.44,IACHIMO,Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
29447,29448,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.45,IACHIMO,The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
29448,29449,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.46,IACHIMO,"Why should I write this down, that's riveted,"
29449,29450,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.47,IACHIMO,Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
29450,29451,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.48,IACHIMO,"The tale of Tereus, here the leaf's turn'd down"
29451,29452,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.49,IACHIMO,Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
29452,29453,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.50,IACHIMO,"To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it."
29453,29454,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.51,IACHIMO,"Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning"
29454,29455,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.52,IACHIMO,"May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear,"
29455,29456,Cymbeline,6.0,2.2.53,IACHIMO,"Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here."
29456,29457,Cymbeline,6.0,,IACHIMO,Clock strikes

29463,29464,Cymbeline,9.0,2.2.58,CLOTEN,It would make any man cold to lose.
29464,29465,Cymbeline,10.0,2.2.59,First Lord,But not every man patient after the noble temper of
29465,29466,Cymbeline,10.0,2.2.60,First Lord,your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
29466,29467,Cymbeline,11.0,2.2.61,CLOTEN,Winning will put any man into courage. If I could

29753,29754,Cymbeline,28.0,2.4.98,IACHIMO,More particulars
29754,29755,Cymbeline,28.0,2.4.99,IACHIMO,Must justify my knowledge.
29755,29756,Cymbeline,29.0,2.4.100,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So they must,"
29756,29757,Cymbeline,29.0,2.4.101,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Or do your honour injury.
29757,29758,Cymbeline,30.0,2.4.102,IACHIMO,The chimney
29758,29759,Cymbeline,30.0,2.4.103,IACHIMO,"Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece"
29759,29760,Cymbeline,30.0,2.4.104,IACHIMO,Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
29760,29761,Cymbeline,30.0,2.4.105,IACHIMO,So likely to report themselves: the cutter
29761,29762,Cymbeline,30.0,2.4.106,IACHIMO,"Was as another nature, dumb, outwent her,"
29762,29763,Cymbeline,30.0,2.4.107,IACHIMO,Motion and breath left out.
29763,29764,Cymbeline,31.0,2.4.108,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,This is a thing
29764,29765,Cymbeline,31.0,2.4.109,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which you might from relation likewise reap,"
29765,29766,Cymbeline,31.0,2.4.110,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Being, as it is, much spoke of."
29766,29767,Cymbeline,32.0,2.4.111,IACHIMO,The roof o' the chamber
29767,29768,Cymbeline,32.0,2.4.112,IACHIMO,With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
29768,29769,Cymbeline,32.0,2.4.113,IACHIMO,I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
29769,29770,Cymbeline,32.0,2.4.114,IACHIMO,"Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely"
29770,29771,Cymbeline,32.0,2.4.115,IACHIMO,Depending on their brands.
29771,29772,Cymbeline,33.0,2.4.116,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,This is her honour!
29772,29773,Cymbeline,33.0,2.4.117,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
29773,29774,Cymbeline,33.0,2.4.118,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Be given to your remembrance--the description
29774,29775,Cymbeline,33.0,2.4.119,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
29775,29776,Cymbeline,33.0,2.4.120,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The wager you have laid.
29776,29777,Cymbeline,34.0,2.4.121,IACHIMO,"Then, if you can,"
29777,29778,Cymbeline,34.0,,IACHIMO,Showing the bracelet
29778,29779,Cymbeline,34.0,2.4.122,IACHIMO,"Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel, see!"
29779,29780,Cymbeline,34.0,2.4.123,IACHIMO,And now 'tis up again: it must be married
29780,29781,Cymbeline,34.0,2.4.124,IACHIMO,"To that your diamond, I'll keep them."
29781,29782,Cymbeline,35.0,2.4.125,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Jove!
29782,29783,Cymbeline,35.0,2.4.126,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Once more let me behold it: is it that
29783,29784,Cymbeline,35.0,2.4.127,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Which I left with her?
29784,29785,Cymbeline,36.0,2.4.128,IACHIMO,Sir--I thank her--that:
29785,29786,Cymbeline,36.0,2.4.129,IACHIMO,"She stripp'd it from her arm, I see her yet,"
29786,29787,Cymbeline,36.0,2.4.130,IACHIMO,"Her pretty action did outsell her gift,"
29787,29788,Cymbeline,36.0,2.4.131,IACHIMO,"And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said"
29788,29789,Cymbeline,36.0,2.4.132,IACHIMO,She prized it once.
29789,29790,Cymbeline,37.0,2.4.133,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,May be she pluck'd it off
29790,29791,Cymbeline,37.0,2.4.134,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To send it me.
29791,29792,Cymbeline,38.0,2.4.135,IACHIMO,"She writes so to you, doth she?"
29792,29793,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.136,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too,"
29793,29794,Cymbeline,39.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Gives the ring
29794,29795,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.137,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is a basilisk unto mine eye,"
29795,29796,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.138,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
29796,29797,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.139,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Where there is beauty, truth, where semblance, love,"
29797,29798,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.140,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Where there's another man: the vows of women
29798,29799,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.141,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,"
29799,29800,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.142,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing."
29800,29801,Cymbeline,39.0,2.4.143,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, above measure false!"
29801,29802,Cymbeline,40.0,2.4.144,PHILARIO,"Have patience, sir,"
29802,29803,Cymbeline,40.0,2.4.145,PHILARIO,"And take your ring again, 'tis not yet won:"
29803,29804,Cymbeline,40.0,2.4.146,PHILARIO,"It may be probable she lost it, or"
29804,29805,Cymbeline,40.0,2.4.147,PHILARIO,"Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,"
29805,29806,Cymbeline,40.0,2.4.148,PHILARIO,Hath stol'n it from her?
29806,29807,Cymbeline,41.0,2.4.149,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Very true,"
29807,29808,Cymbeline,41.0,2.4.150,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:"
29808,29809,Cymbeline,41.0,2.4.151,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Render to me some corporal sign about her,"
29809,29810,Cymbeline,41.0,2.4.152,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More evident than this, for this was stolen."
29810,29811,Cymbeline,42.0,2.4.153,IACHIMO,"By Jupiter, I had it from her arm."
29811,29812,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.154,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Hark you, he swears, by Jupiter he swears."
29812,29813,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.155,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure"
29813,29814,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.156,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,She would not lose it: her attendants are
29814,29815,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.157,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
29815,29816,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.158,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:"
29816,29817,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.159,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The cognizance of her incontinency
29817,29818,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.160,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
29818,29819,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.161,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,thus dearly.
29819,29820,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.162,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"There, take thy hire, and all the fiends of hell"
29820,29821,Cymbeline,43.0,2.4.163,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Divide themselves between you!
29821,29822,Cymbeline,44.0,2.4.164,PHILARIO,"Sir, be patient:"
29822,29823,Cymbeline,44.0,2.4.165,PHILARIO,This is not strong enough to be believed
29823,29824,Cymbeline,44.0,2.4.166,PHILARIO,Of one persuaded well of--
29824,29825,Cymbeline,45.0,2.4.167,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Never talk on't,"
29825,29826,Cymbeline,45.0,2.4.168,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,She hath been colted by him.
29826,29827,Cymbeline,46.0,2.4.169,IACHIMO,If you seek
29827,29828,Cymbeline,46.0,2.4.170,IACHIMO,"For further satisfying, under her breast--"
29828,29829,Cymbeline,46.0,2.4.171,IACHIMO,"Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud"
29829,29830,Cymbeline,46.0,2.4.172,IACHIMO,"Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,"
29830,29831,Cymbeline,46.0,2.4.173,IACHIMO,"I kiss'd it, and it gave me present hunger"
29831,29832,Cymbeline,46.0,2.4.174,IACHIMO,"To feed again, though full. You do remember"
29832,29833,Cymbeline,46.0,2.4.175,IACHIMO,This stain upon her?
29833,29834,Cymbeline,47.0,2.4.176,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Ay, and it doth confirm"
29834,29835,Cymbeline,47.0,2.4.177,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Another stain, as big as hell can hold,"
29835,29836,Cymbeline,47.0,2.4.178,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Were there no more but it.
29836,29837,Cymbeline,48.0,2.4.179,IACHIMO,Will you hear more?
29837,29838,Cymbeline,49.0,2.4.180,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns,"
29838,29839,Cymbeline,49.0,2.4.181,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Once, and a million!"
29839,29840,Cymbeline,50.0,2.4.182,IACHIMO,I'll be sworn--
29840,29841,Cymbeline,51.0,2.4.183,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,No swearing.
29841,29842,Cymbeline,51.0,2.4.184,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If you will swear you have not done't, you lie,"
29842,29843,Cymbeline,51.0,2.4.185,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny"
29843,29844,Cymbeline,51.0,2.4.186,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Thou'st made me cuckold.
29844,29845,Cymbeline,52.0,2.4.187,IACHIMO,I'll deny nothing.
29845,29846,Cymbeline,53.0,2.4.188,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!"
29846,29847,Cymbeline,53.0,2.4.189,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I will go there and do't, i' the court, before"
29847,29848,Cymbeline,53.0,2.4.190,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Her father. I'll do something--
29848,29849,Cymbeline,53.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Exit
29849,29850,Cymbeline,54.0,2.4.191,PHILARIO,Quite besides
29850,29851,Cymbeline,54.0,2.4.192,PHILARIO,The government of patience! You have won:
29851,29852,Cymbeline,54.0,2.4.193,PHILARIO,"Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath"
29852,29853,Cymbeline,54.0,2.4.194,PHILARIO,He hath against himself.
29853,29854,Cymbeline,55.0,2.4.195,IACHIMO,With an my heart.

29859,29860,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.3,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And that most venerable man which I
29860,29861,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.4,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Did call my father, was I know not where"
29861,29862,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.5,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"When I was stamp'd, some coiner with his tools"
29862,29863,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.6,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd
29863,29864,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.7,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The Dian of that time so doth my wife

29865,29866,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.9,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
29866,29867,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.10,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And pray'd me oft forbearance, did it with"
29867,29868,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.11,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
29868,29869,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.12,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Might well have warm'd old Saturn, that I thought her"
29869,29870,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.13,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!"
29870,29871,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.14,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--"
29871,29872,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.15,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,"
29872,29873,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.16,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,"
29873,29874,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.17,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Cried 'O!' and mounted, found no opposition"
29874,29875,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.18,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,But what he look'd for should oppose and she
29875,29876,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.19,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
29876,29877,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.20,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
29877,29878,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.21,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That tends to vice in man, but I affirm"
29878,29879,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.22,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,"
29879,29880,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.23,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The woman's, flattering, hers, deceiving, hers,"
29880,29881,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.24,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers, revenges, hers,"
29881,29882,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.25,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,"
29882,29883,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.26,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nice longing, slanders, mutability,"
29883,29884,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.27,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,"
29884,29885,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.28,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Why, hers, in part or all, but rather, all,"
29885,29886,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.29,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,For even to vice
29886,29887,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.30,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,They are not constant but are changing still

29889,29890,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.33,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill"
29890,29891,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.34,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"In a true hate, to pray they have their will:"
29891,29892,Cymbeline,1.0,2.5.35,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The very devils cannot plague them better.

29902,29903,Cymbeline,2.0,3.1.7,CAIUS LUCIUS,Than in his feats deserving it--for him
29903,29904,Cymbeline,2.0,3.1.8,CAIUS LUCIUS,"And his succession granted Rome a tribute,"
29904,29905,Cymbeline,2.0,3.1.9,CAIUS LUCIUS,"Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately"
29905,29906,Cymbeline,2.0,3.1.10,CAIUS LUCIUS,Is left untender'd.

29920,29921,Cymbeline,5.0,3.1.25,QUEEN,But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest

30113,30114,Cymbeline,4.0,3.3.25,BELARIUS,"Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,"
30114,30115,Cymbeline,4.0,3.3.26,BELARIUS,Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:

30124,30125,Cymbeline,5.0,3.3.36,GUIDERIUS,"A prison for a debtor, that not dares"

30126,30127,Cymbeline,6.0,3.3.38,ARVIRAGUS,What should we speak of
30127,30128,Cymbeline,6.0,3.3.39,ARVIRAGUS,When we are old as you? when we shall hear
30128,30129,Cymbeline,6.0,3.3.40,ARVIRAGUS,"The rain and wind beat dark December, how,"
30129,30130,Cymbeline,6.0,3.3.41,ARVIRAGUS,"In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse"
30130,30131,Cymbeline,6.0,3.3.42,ARVIRAGUS,"The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing,"

30137,30138,Cymbeline,7.0,3.3.49,BELARIUS,Did you but know the city's usuries
30138,30139,Cymbeline,7.0,3.3.50,BELARIUS,"And felt them knowingly, the art o' the court"
30139,30140,Cymbeline,7.0,3.3.51,BELARIUS,"As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb"

30142,30143,Cymbeline,7.0,3.3.54,BELARIUS,A pain that only seems to seek out danger

30153,30154,Cymbeline,7.0,3.3.65,BELARIUS,Was not far off: then was I as a tree

30157,30158,Cymbeline,7.0,3.3.69,BELARIUS,And left me bare to weather.
30158,30159,Cymbeline,8.0,3.3.70,GUIDERIUS,Uncertain favour!
30159,30160,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.71,BELARIUS,My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
30160,30161,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.72,BELARIUS,"But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd"

30162,30163,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.74,BELARIUS,I was confederate with the Romans: so
30163,30164,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.75,BELARIUS,"Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years"

30168,30169,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.80,BELARIUS,This is not hunters' language: he that strikes

30174,30175,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.85,BELARIUS,How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
30175,30176,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.86,BELARIUS,"These boys know little they are sons to the king,"
30176,30177,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.87,BELARIUS,Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.

30190,30191,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.101,BELARIUS,Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
30191,30192,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.102,BELARIUS,"That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,"
30192,30193,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.103,BELARIUS,"Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,"
30193,30194,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.104,BELARIUS,Strikes life into my speech and shows much more

30195,30196,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.106,BELARIUS,O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
30196,30197,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.107,BELARIUS,"Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,"
30197,30198,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.108,BELARIUS,"At three and two years old, I stole these babes,"
30198,30199,Cymbeline,9.0,3.3.109,BELARIUS,"Thinking to bar thee of succession, as"

30210,30211,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.3,IMOGEN,"To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!"
30211,30212,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.4,IMOGEN,"Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,"
30212,30213,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.5,IMOGEN,That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
30213,30214,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.6,IMOGEN,"From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,"
30214,30215,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.7,IMOGEN,Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
30215,30216,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.8,IMOGEN,Beyond self-explication: put thyself

30217,30218,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.10,IMOGEN,Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
30218,30219,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.11,IMOGEN,"Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with"
30219,30220,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.12,IMOGEN,"A look untender? If't be summer news,"
30220,30221,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.13,IMOGEN,"Smile to't before, if winterly, thou need'st"
30221,30222,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.14,IMOGEN,But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
30222,30223,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.15,IMOGEN,"That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,"
30223,30224,Cymbeline,1.0,3.4.16,IMOGEN,"And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue"

30227,30228,Cymbeline,2.0,3.4.20,PISANIO,"And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing"

30232,30233,Cymbeline,3.0,3.4.25,IMOGEN,but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
30233,30234,Cymbeline,3.0,3.4.26,IMOGEN,"as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,"
30234,30235,Cymbeline,3.0,3.4.27,IMOGEN,"must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with"
30235,30236,Cymbeline,3.0,3.4.28,IMOGEN,the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away

30237,30238,Cymbeline,3.0,3.4.30,IMOGEN,Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose

30241,30242,Cymbeline,4.0,3.4.34,PISANIO,What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
30242,30243,Cymbeline,4.0,3.4.35,PISANIO,"Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,"
30243,30244,Cymbeline,4.0,3.4.36,PISANIO,"Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue"

30250,30251,Cymbeline,5.0,3.4.43,IMOGEN,To lie in watch there and to think on him?
30251,30252,Cymbeline,5.0,3.4.44,IMOGEN,To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep

30253,30254,Cymbeline,5.0,3.4.46,IMOGEN,To break it with a fearful dream of him
30254,30255,Cymbeline,5.0,3.4.47,IMOGEN,"And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?"
30255,30256,Cymbeline,6.0,3.4.48,PISANIO,"Alas, good lady!"
30256,30257,Cymbeline,7.0,3.4.49,IMOGEN,"I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,"

30315,30316,Cymbeline,12.0,3.4.108,PISANIO,Since I received command to do this business
30316,30317,Cymbeline,12.0,3.4.109,PISANIO,I have not slept one wink.

30327,30328,Cymbeline,15.0,3.4.120,IMOGEN,The elected deer before thee?
30328,30329,Cymbeline,16.0,3.4.121,PISANIO,But to win time
30329,30330,Cymbeline,16.0,3.4.122,PISANIO,"To lose so bad employment, in the which"
30330,30331,Cymbeline,16.0,3.4.123,PISANIO,"I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,"
30331,30332,Cymbeline,16.0,3.4.124,PISANIO,Hear me with patience.

30337,30338,Cymbeline,18.0,3.4.130,PISANIO,I thought you would not back again.
30338,30339,Cymbeline,19.0,3.4.131,IMOGEN,"Most like,"

30344,30345,Cymbeline,20.0,3.4.137,PISANIO,"Some villain, ay, and singular in his art."
30345,30346,Cymbeline,20.0,3.4.138,PISANIO,Hath done you both this cursed injury.
30346,30347,Cymbeline,21.0,3.4.139,IMOGEN,Some Roman courtezan.

30351,30352,Cymbeline,22.0,3.4.144,PISANIO,And that will well confirm it.

30362,30363,Cymbeline,26.0,3.4.155,PISANIO,Then not in Britain must you bide.
30363,30364,Cymbeline,27.0,3.4.156,IMOGEN,Where then
30364,30365,Cymbeline,27.0,3.4.157,IMOGEN,"Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,"
30365,30366,Cymbeline,27.0,3.4.158,IMOGEN,Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume

30599,30600,Cymbeline,48.0,3.5.158,CLOTEN,bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
30600,30601,Cymbeline,48.0,3.5.159,CLOTEN,held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
30601,30602,Cymbeline,48.0,3.5.160,CLOTEN,than my noble and natural person together with the

30605,30606,Cymbeline,48.0,3.5.164,CLOTEN,"be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my"

30950,30951,Cymbeline,49.0,4.2.137,BELARIUS,"I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,"
30951,30952,Cymbeline,49.0,4.2.138,BELARIUS,But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
30952,30953,Cymbeline,49.0,4.2.139,BELARIUS,"Which then he wore, the snatches in his voice,"
30953,30954,Cymbeline,49.0,4.2.140,BELARIUS,"And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute"
30954,30955,Cymbeline,49.0,4.2.141,BELARIUS,'Twas very Cloten.

30978,30979,Cymbeline,56.0,4.2.164,GUIDERIUS,Protects not us: then why should we be tender

30980,30981,Cymbeline,56.0,4.2.166,GUIDERIUS,"Play judge and executioner all himself,"
30981,30982,Cymbeline,56.0,4.2.167,GUIDERIUS,For we do fear the law? What company
30982,30983,Cymbeline,56.0,4.2.168,GUIDERIUS,Discover you abroad?
30983,30984,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.169,BELARIUS,No single soul

30985,30986,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.171,BELARIUS,He must have some attendants. Though his humour
30986,30987,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.172,BELARIUS,"Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that"

30988,30989,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.174,BELARIUS,Absolute madness could so far have raved
30989,30990,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.175,BELARIUS,"To bring him here alone, although perhaps"
30990,30991,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.176,BELARIUS,It may be heard at court that such as we
30991,30992,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.177,BELARIUS,"Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time"
30992,30993,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.178,BELARIUS,"May make some stronger head, the which he hearing--"
30993,30994,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.179,BELARIUS,"As it is like him--might break out, and swear"
30994,30995,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.180,BELARIUS,"He'ld fetch us in, yet is't not probable"
30995,30996,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.181,BELARIUS,"To come alone, either he so undertaking,"
30996,30997,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.182,BELARIUS,"Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,"
30997,30998,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.183,BELARIUS,If we do fear this body hath a tail
30998,30999,Cymbeline,57.0,4.2.184,BELARIUS,More perilous than the head.
30999,31000,Cymbeline,58.0,4.2.185,ARVIRAGUS,Let ordinance
31000,31001,Cymbeline,58.0,4.2.186,ARVIRAGUS,"Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,"
31001,31002,Cymbeline,58.0,4.2.187,ARVIRAGUS,My brother hath done well.
31002,31003,Cymbeline,59.0,4.2.188,BELARIUS,I had no mind
31003,31004,Cymbeline,59.0,4.2.189,BELARIUS,To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
31004,31005,Cymbeline,59.0,4.2.190,BELARIUS,Did make my way long forth.
31005,31006,Cymbeline,60.0,4.2.191,GUIDERIUS,"With his own sword,"
31006,31007,Cymbeline,60.0,4.2.192,GUIDERIUS,"Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en"
31007,31008,Cymbeline,60.0,4.2.193,GUIDERIUS,His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
31008,31009,Cymbeline,60.0,4.2.194,GUIDERIUS,"Behind our rock, and let it to the sea,"
31009,31010,Cymbeline,60.0,4.2.195,GUIDERIUS,"And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:"
31010,31011,Cymbeline,60.0,4.2.196,GUIDERIUS,That's all I reck.
31011,31012,Cymbeline,60.0,,GUIDERIUS,Exit

31015,31016,Cymbeline,62.0,4.2.200,ARVIRAGUS,Would I had done't
31016,31017,Cymbeline,62.0,4.2.201,ARVIRAGUS,"So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,"
31017,31018,Cymbeline,62.0,4.2.202,ARVIRAGUS,"I love thee brotherly, but envy much"
31018,31019,Cymbeline,62.0,4.2.203,ARVIRAGUS,"Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,"
31019,31020,Cymbeline,62.0,4.2.204,ARVIRAGUS,"That possible strength might meet, would seek us through"

31021,31022,Cymbeline,63.0,4.2.206,BELARIUS,"Well, 'tis done:"
31022,31023,Cymbeline,63.0,4.2.207,BELARIUS,"We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger"
31023,31024,Cymbeline,63.0,4.2.208,BELARIUS,"Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock,"
31024,31025,Cymbeline,63.0,4.2.209,BELARIUS,You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
31025,31026,Cymbeline,63.0,4.2.210,BELARIUS,"Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him"
31026,31027,Cymbeline,63.0,4.2.211,BELARIUS,To dinner presently.
31027,31028,Cymbeline,64.0,4.2.212,ARVIRAGUS,Poor sick Fidele!
31028,31029,Cymbeline,64.0,4.2.213,ARVIRAGUS,I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
31029,31030,Cymbeline,64.0,4.2.214,ARVIRAGUS,"I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,"
31030,31031,Cymbeline,64.0,4.2.215,ARVIRAGUS,And praise myself for charity.
31031,31032,Cymbeline,64.0,,ARVIRAGUS,Exit
31032,31033,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.216,BELARIUS,"O thou goddess,"
31033,31034,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.217,BELARIUS,"Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st"
31034,31035,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.218,BELARIUS,In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
31035,31036,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.219,BELARIUS,"As zephyrs blowing below the violet,"
31036,31037,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.220,BELARIUS,"Not wagging his sweet head, and yet as rough,"
31037,31038,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.221,BELARIUS,"Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,"
31038,31039,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.222,BELARIUS,"That by the top doth take the mountain pine,"
31039,31040,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.223,BELARIUS,And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
31040,31041,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.224,BELARIUS,That an invisible instinct should frame them

31042,31043,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.226,BELARIUS,"Civility not seen from other, valour"
31043,31044,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.227,BELARIUS,"That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop"
31044,31045,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.228,BELARIUS,As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
31045,31046,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.229,BELARIUS,"What Cloten's being here to us portends,"
31046,31047,Cymbeline,65.0,4.2.230,BELARIUS,Or what his death will bring us.
31047,31048,Cymbeline,65.0,,BELARIUS,Re-enter GUIDERIUS
31048,31049,Cymbeline,66.0,4.2.231,GUIDERIUS,Where's my brother?
31049,31050,Cymbeline,66.0,4.2.232,GUIDERIUS,"I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,"
31050,31051,Cymbeline,66.0,4.2.233,GUIDERIUS,In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
31051,31052,Cymbeline,66.0,4.2.234,GUIDERIUS,For his return.
31052,31053,Cymbeline,66.0,,GUIDERIUS,Solemn music
31053,31054,Cymbeline,67.0,4.2.235,BELARIUS,My ingenious instrument!

31055,31056,Cymbeline,67.0,4.2.237,BELARIUS,Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
31056,31057,Cymbeline,68.0,4.2.238,GUIDERIUS,Is he at home?
31057,31058,Cymbeline,69.0,4.2.239,BELARIUS,He went hence even now.
31058,31059,Cymbeline,70.0,4.2.240,GUIDERIUS,What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
31059,31060,Cymbeline,70.0,4.2.241,GUIDERIUS,it did not speak before. All solemn things
31060,31061,Cymbeline,70.0,4.2.242,GUIDERIUS,Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
31061,31062,Cymbeline,70.0,4.2.243,GUIDERIUS,Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
31062,31063,Cymbeline,70.0,4.2.244,GUIDERIUS,Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
31063,31064,Cymbeline,70.0,4.2.245,GUIDERIUS,Is Cadwal mad?
31064,31065,Cymbeline,71.0,4.2.246,BELARIUS,"Look, here he comes,"
31065,31066,Cymbeline,71.0,4.2.247,BELARIUS,And brings the dire occasion in his arms
31066,31067,Cymbeline,71.0,4.2.248,BELARIUS,Of what we blame him for.
31067,31068,Cymbeline,71.0,,BELARIUS,"Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms"
31068,31069,Cymbeline,72.0,4.2.249,ARVIRAGUS,The bird is dead
31069,31070,Cymbeline,72.0,4.2.250,ARVIRAGUS,That we have made so much on. I had rather
31070,31071,Cymbeline,72.0,4.2.251,ARVIRAGUS,"Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,"
31071,31072,Cymbeline,72.0,4.2.252,ARVIRAGUS,"To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,"
31072,31073,Cymbeline,72.0,4.2.253,ARVIRAGUS,Than have seen this.
31073,31074,Cymbeline,73.0,4.2.254,GUIDERIUS,"O sweetest, fairest lily!"
31074,31075,Cymbeline,73.0,4.2.255,GUIDERIUS,My brother wears thee not the one half so well
31075,31076,Cymbeline,73.0,4.2.256,GUIDERIUS,As when thou grew'st thyself.
31076,31077,Cymbeline,74.0,4.2.257,BELARIUS,O melancholy!
31077,31078,Cymbeline,74.0,4.2.258,BELARIUS,Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
31078,31079,Cymbeline,74.0,4.2.259,BELARIUS,"The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare"
31079,31080,Cymbeline,74.0,4.2.260,BELARIUS,Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
31080,31081,Cymbeline,74.0,4.2.261,BELARIUS,"Jove knows what man thou mightst have made, but I,"
31081,31082,Cymbeline,74.0,4.2.262,BELARIUS,"Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy."
31082,31083,Cymbeline,74.0,4.2.263,BELARIUS,How found you him?
31083,31084,Cymbeline,75.0,4.2.264,ARVIRAGUS,"Stark, as you see:"
31084,31085,Cymbeline,75.0,4.2.265,ARVIRAGUS,"Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,"
31085,31086,Cymbeline,75.0,4.2.266,ARVIRAGUS,"Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at, his"

31087,31088,Cymbeline,75.0,4.2.268,ARVIRAGUS,Reposing on a cushion.
31088,31089,Cymbeline,76.0,4.2.269,GUIDERIUS,Where?
31089,31090,Cymbeline,77.0,4.2.270,ARVIRAGUS,"O' the floor,"
31090,31091,Cymbeline,77.0,4.2.271,ARVIRAGUS,"His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put"
31091,31092,Cymbeline,77.0,4.2.272,ARVIRAGUS,"My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness"
31092,31093,Cymbeline,77.0,4.2.273,ARVIRAGUS,Answer'd my steps too loud.
31093,31094,Cymbeline,78.0,4.2.274,GUIDERIUS,"Why, he but sleeps:"
31094,31095,Cymbeline,78.0,4.2.275,GUIDERIUS,"If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed,"
31095,31096,Cymbeline,78.0,4.2.276,GUIDERIUS,"With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,"
31096,31097,Cymbeline,78.0,4.2.277,GUIDERIUS,And worms will not come to thee.
31097,31098,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.278,ARVIRAGUS,With fairest flowers
31098,31099,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.279,ARVIRAGUS,"Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,"
31099,31100,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.280,ARVIRAGUS,I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack

31101,31102,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.282,ARVIRAGUS,"The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor"
31102,31103,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.283,ARVIRAGUS,"The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,"
31103,31104,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.284,ARVIRAGUS,"Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,"
31104,31105,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.285,ARVIRAGUS,"With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming"
31105,31106,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.286,ARVIRAGUS,Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
31106,31107,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.287,ARVIRAGUS,"Without a monument!--bring thee all this,"

31108,31109,Cymbeline,79.0,4.2.289,ARVIRAGUS,To winter-ground thy corse.

31110,31111,Cymbeline,80.0,4.2.291,GUIDERIUS,And do not play in wench-like words with that
31111,31112,Cymbeline,80.0,4.2.292,GUIDERIUS,"Which is so serious. Let us bury him,"
31112,31113,Cymbeline,80.0,4.2.293,GUIDERIUS,And not protract with admiration what
31113,31114,Cymbeline,80.0,4.2.294,GUIDERIUS,Is now due debt. To the grave!
31114,31115,Cymbeline,81.0,4.2.295,ARVIRAGUS,"Say, where shall's lay him?"
31115,31116,Cymbeline,82.0,4.2.296,GUIDERIUS,"By good Euriphile, our mother."
31116,31117,Cymbeline,83.0,4.2.297,ARVIRAGUS,Be't so:
31117,31118,Cymbeline,83.0,4.2.298,ARVIRAGUS,"And let us, Polydore, though now our voices"

31119,31120,Cymbeline,83.0,4.2.300,ARVIRAGUS,"As once our mother, use like note and words,"
31120,31121,Cymbeline,83.0,4.2.301,ARVIRAGUS,Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
31121,31122,Cymbeline,84.0,4.2.302,GUIDERIUS,"Cadwal,"
31122,31123,Cymbeline,84.0,4.2.303,GUIDERIUS,"I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee,"
31123,31124,Cymbeline,84.0,4.2.304,GUIDERIUS,For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
31124,31125,Cymbeline,84.0,4.2.305,GUIDERIUS,Than priests and fanes that lie.
31125,31126,Cymbeline,85.0,4.2.306,ARVIRAGUS,"We'll speak it, then."
31126,31127,Cymbeline,86.0,4.2.307,BELARIUS,"Great griefs, I see, medicine the less, for Cloten"
31127,31128,Cymbeline,86.0,4.2.308,BELARIUS,"Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys,"
31128,31129,Cymbeline,86.0,4.2.309,BELARIUS,"And though he came our enemy, remember"
31129,31130,Cymbeline,86.0,4.2.310,BELARIUS,He was paid for that: though mean and

31133,31134,Cymbeline,86.0,4.2.314,BELARIUS,Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely

31135,31136,Cymbeline,86.0,4.2.316,BELARIUS,Yet bury him as a prince.

31375,31376,Cymbeline,1.0,4.4.1,GUIDERIUS,The noise is round about us.
31376,31377,Cymbeline,2.0,4.4.2,BELARIUS,Let us from it.
31377,31378,Cymbeline,3.0,4.4.3,ARVIRAGUS,"What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it"
31378,31379,Cymbeline,3.0,4.4.4,ARVIRAGUS,From action and adventure?
31379,31380,Cymbeline,4.0,4.4.5,GUIDERIUS,"Nay, what hope"
31380,31381,Cymbeline,4.0,4.4.6,GUIDERIUS,"Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans"
31381,31382,Cymbeline,4.0,4.4.7,GUIDERIUS,"Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us"
31382,31383,Cymbeline,4.0,4.4.8,GUIDERIUS,For barbarous and unnatural revolts
31383,31384,Cymbeline,4.0,4.4.9,GUIDERIUS,"During their use, and slay us after."
31384,31385,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.10,BELARIUS,"Sons,"
31385,31386,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.11,BELARIUS,"We'll higher to the mountains, there secure us."
31386,31387,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.12,BELARIUS,To the king's party there's no going: newness
31387,31388,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.13,BELARIUS,"Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd"
31388,31389,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.14,BELARIUS,Among the bands--may drive us to a render
31389,31390,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.15,BELARIUS,"Where we have lived, and so extort from's that"
31390,31391,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.16,BELARIUS,"Which we have done, whose answer would be death"
31391,31392,Cymbeline,5.0,4.4.17,BELARIUS,Drawn on with torture.
31392,31393,Cymbeline,6.0,4.4.18,GUIDERIUS,"This is, sir, a doubt"
31393,31394,Cymbeline,6.0,4.4.19,GUIDERIUS,"In such a time nothing becoming you,"
31394,31395,Cymbeline,6.0,4.4.20,GUIDERIUS,Nor satisfying us.
31395,31396,Cymbeline,7.0,4.4.21,ARVIRAGUS,It is not likely
31396,31397,Cymbeline,7.0,4.4.22,ARVIRAGUS,"That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,"
31397,31398,Cymbeline,7.0,4.4.23,ARVIRAGUS,"Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes"
31398,31399,Cymbeline,7.0,4.4.24,ARVIRAGUS,"And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,"
31399,31400,Cymbeline,7.0,4.4.25,ARVIRAGUS,"That they will waste their time upon our note,"
31400,31401,Cymbeline,7.0,4.4.26,ARVIRAGUS,To know from whence we are.
31401,31402,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.27,BELARIUS,"O, I am known"
31402,31403,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.28,BELARIUS,"Of many in the army: many years,"
31403,31404,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.29,BELARIUS,"Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him"
31404,31405,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.30,BELARIUS,"From my remembrance. And, besides, the king"
31405,31406,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.31,BELARIUS,"Hath not deserved my service nor your loves,"
31406,31407,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.32,BELARIUS,"Who find in my exile the want of breeding,"
31407,31408,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.33,BELARIUS,"The certainty of this hard life, aye hopeless"
31408,31409,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.34,BELARIUS,"To have the courtesy your cradle promised,"
31409,31410,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.35,BELARIUS,But to be still hot summer's tamings and
31410,31411,Cymbeline,8.0,4.4.36,BELARIUS,The shrinking slaves of winter.
31411,31412,Cymbeline,9.0,4.4.37,GUIDERIUS,Than be so
31412,31413,Cymbeline,9.0,4.4.38,GUIDERIUS,"Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:"
31413,31414,Cymbeline,9.0,4.4.39,GUIDERIUS,"I and my brother are not known, yourself"
31414,31415,Cymbeline,9.0,4.4.40,GUIDERIUS,"So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,"
31415,31416,Cymbeline,9.0,4.4.41,GUIDERIUS,Cannot be question'd.
31416,31417,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.42,ARVIRAGUS,"By this sun that shines,"
31417,31418,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.43,ARVIRAGUS,I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
31418,31419,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.44,ARVIRAGUS,"Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,"
31419,31420,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.45,ARVIRAGUS,"But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!"
31420,31421,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.46,ARVIRAGUS,"Never bestrid a horse, save one that had"
31421,31422,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.47,ARVIRAGUS,"A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel"
31422,31423,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.48,ARVIRAGUS,Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
31423,31424,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.49,ARVIRAGUS,"To look upon the holy sun, to have"
31424,31425,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.50,ARVIRAGUS,"The benefit of his blest beams, remaining"
31425,31426,Cymbeline,10.0,4.4.51,ARVIRAGUS,So long a poor unknown.
31426,31427,Cymbeline,11.0,4.4.52,GUIDERIUS,"By heavens, I'll go:"
31427,31428,Cymbeline,11.0,4.4.53,GUIDERIUS,"If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,"
31428,31429,Cymbeline,11.0,4.4.54,GUIDERIUS,"I'll take the better care, but if you will not,"
31429,31430,Cymbeline,11.0,4.4.55,GUIDERIUS,The hazard therefore due fall on me by
31430,31431,Cymbeline,11.0,4.4.56,GUIDERIUS,The hands of Romans!
31431,31432,Cymbeline,12.0,4.4.57,ARVIRAGUS,So say I	amen.
31432,31433,Cymbeline,13.0,4.4.58,BELARIUS,"No reason I, since of your lives you set"
31433,31434,Cymbeline,13.0,4.4.59,BELARIUS,"So slight a valuation, should reserve"
31434,31435,Cymbeline,13.0,4.4.60,BELARIUS,"My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!"
31435,31436,Cymbeline,13.0,4.4.61,BELARIUS,"If in your country wars you chance to die,"
31436,31437,Cymbeline,13.0,4.4.62,BELARIUS,"That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:"
31437,31438,Cymbeline,13.0,4.4.63,BELARIUS,"Lead, lead."

31441,31442,Cymbeline,13.0,4.4.66,BELARIUS,Till it fly out and show them princes born.

31446,31447,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.1,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd"
31447,31448,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.2,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,"
31448,31449,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.3,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If each of you should take this course, how many"
31449,31450,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.4,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Must murder wives much better than themselves
31450,31451,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.5,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
31451,31452,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.6,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Every good servant does not all commands:
31452,31453,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.7,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
31453,31454,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.8,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never"
31454,31455,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.9,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Had lived to put on this: so had you saved

31456,31457,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.11,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,"
31457,31458,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.12,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You snatch some hence for little faults, that's love,"
31458,31459,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.13,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To have them fall no more: you some permit
31459,31460,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.14,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To second ills with ills, each elder worse,"
31460,31461,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.15,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift."
31461,31462,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.16,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,"
31462,31463,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.17,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
31463,31464,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.18,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Among the Italian gentry, and to fight"
31464,31465,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.19,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough

31466,31467,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.21,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,"
31467,31468,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.22,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
31468,31469,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.23,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
31469,31470,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.24,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
31470,31471,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.25,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Against the part I come with, so I'll die"
31471,31472,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.26,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life"
31472,31473,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.27,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Is every breath a death, and thus, unknown,"

31474,31475,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.29,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know

31476,31477,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.31,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!"
31477,31478,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.32,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin"
31478,31479,Cymbeline,1.0,5.1.33,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The fashion, less without and more within."

They march over and go  out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him"
31482,31483,Cymbeline,1.0,5.2.1,IACHIMO,The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
31483,31484,Cymbeline,1.0,5.2.2,IACHIMO,"Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,"

31491,31492,Cymbeline,1.0,5.2.10,IACHIMO,Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.

31510,31511,Cymbeline,2.0,5.3.3,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Though you, it seems, come from the fliers."
31511,31512,Cymbeline,3.0,5.3.4,Lord,I did.

31551,31552,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.44,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
31552,31553,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.45,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon"
31553,31554,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.46,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A rout, confusion thick, forthwith they fly"
31554,31555,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.47,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles, slaves,"
31555,31556,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.48,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,"
31556,31557,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.49,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Like fragments in hard voyages, became"
31557,31558,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.50,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
31558,31559,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.51,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!"
31559,31560,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.52,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Some slain before, some dying, some their friends"
31560,31561,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.53,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,"
31561,31562,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.54,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:
31562,31563,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.55,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Those that would die or ere resist are grown
31563,31564,Cymbeline,6.0,5.3.56,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,The mortal bugs o' the field.
31564,31565,Cymbeline,7.0,5.3.57,Lord,This was strange chance
31565,31566,Cymbeline,7.0,5.3.58,Lord,"A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys."
31566,31567,Cymbeline,8.0,5.3.59,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made"
31567,31568,Cymbeline,8.0,5.3.60,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Rather to wonder at the things you hear
31568,31569,Cymbeline,8.0,5.3.61,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,"
31569,31570,Cymbeline,8.0,5.3.62,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
31570,31571,Cymbeline,8.0,5.3.63,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,"
31571,31572,Cymbeline,8.0,5.3.64,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'"
31572,31573,Cymbeline,9.0,5.3.65,Lord,"Nay, be not angry, sir."
31573,31574,Cymbeline,10.0,5.3.66,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Lack, to what end?"
31574,31575,Cymbeline,10.0,5.3.67,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend,"
31575,31576,Cymbeline,10.0,5.3.68,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For if he'll do as he is made to do,"
31576,31577,Cymbeline,10.0,5.3.69,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
31577,31578,Cymbeline,10.0,5.3.70,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,You have put me into rhyme.
31578,31579,Cymbeline,11.0,5.3.71,Lord,"Farewell, you're angry."
31579,31580,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.72,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Still going?
31580,31581,Cymbeline,12.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Exit Lord
31581,31582,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.73,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"This is a lord! O noble misery,"
31582,31583,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.74,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!"
31583,31584,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.75,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,To-day how many would have given their honours
31584,31585,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.76,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,"
31585,31586,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.77,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,"
31586,31587,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.78,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Could not find death where I did hear him groan,"
31587,31588,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.79,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,"
31588,31589,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.80,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,"
31589,31590,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.81,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Sweet words, or hath more ministers than we"
31590,31591,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.82,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him"
31591,31592,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.83,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For being now a favourer to the Briton,"
31592,31593,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.84,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"No more a Briton, I have resumed again"
31593,31594,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.85,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The part I came in: fight I will no more,"
31594,31595,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.86,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
31595,31596,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.87,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
31596,31597,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.88,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Here made by the Roman, great the answer be"
31597,31598,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.89,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death,"
31598,31599,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.90,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"On either side I come to spend my breath,"
31599,31600,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.91,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,"
31600,31601,Cymbeline,12.0,5.3.92,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,But end it by some means for Imogen.
31601,31602,Cymbeline,12.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Enter two British Captains and Soldiers
31602,31603,Cymbeline,13.0,5.3.93,First Captain,Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
31603,31604,Cymbeline,13.0,5.3.94,First Captain,'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
31604,31605,Cymbeline,14.0,5.3.95,Second Captain,"There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,"
31605,31606,Cymbeline,14.0,5.3.96,Second Captain,That gave the affront with them.
31606,31607,Cymbeline,15.0,5.3.97,First Captain,So 'tis reported:
31607,31608,Cymbeline,15.0,5.3.98,First Captain,But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
31608,31609,Cymbeline,16.0,5.3.99,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A Roman,"
31609,31610,Cymbeline,16.0,5.3.100,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds"
31610,31611,Cymbeline,16.0,5.3.101,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Had answer'd him.
31611,31612,Cymbeline,17.0,5.3.102,Second Captain,"Lay hands on him, a dog!"
31612,31613,Cymbeline,17.0,5.3.103,Second Captain,A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
31613,31614,Cymbeline,17.0,5.3.104,Second Captain,What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
31614,31615,Cymbeline,17.0,5.3.105,Second Captain,his service
31615,31616,Cymbeline,17.0,5.3.106,Second Captain,As if he were of note: bring him to the king.
31616,31617,Cymbeline,17.0,5.3.106,Second Captain,"Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,  PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.  The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to  CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes"
31617,31618,Cymbeline,17.0,5.3.106,Second Captain,SCENE IV. A British prison.
31618,31619,Cymbeline,17.0,,Second Captain,Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers
31619,31620,Cymbeline,1.0,5.4.1,First Gaoler,"You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you,"
31620,31621,Cymbeline,1.0,5.4.2,First Gaoler,So graze as you find pasture.
31621,31622,Cymbeline,2.0,5.4.3,Second Gaoler,"Ay, or a stomach."
31622,31623,Cymbeline,2.0,,Second Gaoler,Exeunt Gaolers
31623,31624,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.4,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,"
31624,31625,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.5,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"think, to liberty: yet am I better"
31625,31626,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.6,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Than one that's sick o' the gout, since he had rather"
31626,31627,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.7,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
31627,31628,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.8,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"By the sure physician, death, who is the key"
31628,31629,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.9,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd"
31629,31630,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.10,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me"
31630,31631,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.11,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,"
31631,31632,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.12,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?"
31632,31633,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.13,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"So children temporal fathers do appease,"
31633,31634,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.14,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
31634,31635,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.15,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I cannot do it better than in gyves,"
31635,31636,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.16,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,"
31636,31637,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.17,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take"
31637,31638,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.18,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,No stricter render of me than my all.
31638,31639,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.19,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"I know you are more clement than vile men,"
31639,31640,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.20,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Who of their broken debtors take a third,"
31640,31641,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.21,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again"
31641,31642,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.22,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,On their abatement: that's not my desire:
31642,31643,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.23,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"For Imogen's dear life take mine, and though"
31643,31644,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.24,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life, you coin'd it:"
31644,31645,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.25,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp,"
31645,31646,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.26,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:"
31646,31647,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.27,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,"
31647,31648,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.28,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"If you will take this audit, take this life,"
31648,31649,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.29,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
31649,31650,Cymbeline,3.0,5.4.30,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,I'll speak to thee in silence.
31650,31651,Cymbeline,3.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Sleeps
31651,31652,Cymbeline,3.0,,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,"Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,  SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,  an old man, attired like a warrior, leading in  his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother  to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:  then, after other music, follow the two young  Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with  wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping"
31652,31653,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.31,Sicilius Leonatus,"No more, thou thunder-master, show"
31653,31654,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.32,Sicilius Leonatus,Thy spite on mortal flies:

31655,31656,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.34,Sicilius Leonatus,That thy adulteries
31656,31657,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.35,Sicilius Leonatus,Rates and revenges.
31657,31658,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.36,Sicilius Leonatus,"Hath my poor boy done aught but well,"
31658,31659,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.37,Sicilius Leonatus,Whose face I never saw?
31659,31660,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.38,Sicilius Leonatus,I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
31660,31661,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.39,Sicilius Leonatus,Attending nature's law:
31661,31662,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.40,Sicilius Leonatus,"Whose father then, as men report"
31662,31663,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.41,Sicilius Leonatus,"Thou orphans' father art,"
31663,31664,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.42,Sicilius Leonatus,"Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him"
31664,31665,Cymbeline,4.0,5.4.43,Sicilius Leonatus,From this earth-vexing smart.

31669,31670,Cymbeline,5.0,5.4.48,Mother,A thing of pity!

31671,31672,Cymbeline,6.0,5.4.50,Sicilius Leonatus,"Moulded the stuff so fair,"
31672,31673,Cymbeline,6.0,5.4.51,Sicilius Leonatus,"That he deserved the praise o' the world,"
31673,31674,Cymbeline,6.0,5.4.52,Sicilius Leonatus,As great Sicilius' heir.

31920,31921,Cymbeline,19.0,5.5.81,CYMBELINE,"That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,"
31921,31922,Cymbeline,19.0,5.5.82,CYMBELINE,And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

31948,31949,Cymbeline,21.0,5.5.108,CYMBELINE,I have surely seen him:

31960,31961,Cymbeline,24.0,5.5.120,IMOGEN,"No, no: alack,"
31961,31962,Cymbeline,24.0,5.5.121,IMOGEN,There's other work in hand: I see a thing

31966,31967,Cymbeline,25.0,5.5.126,CAIUS LUCIUS,That place them on the truth of girls and boys.

31968,31969,Cymbeline,26.0,5.5.128,CYMBELINE,"What wouldst thou, boy?"
31969,31970,Cymbeline,26.0,5.5.129,CYMBELINE,I love thee more and more: think more and more
31970,31971,Cymbeline,26.0,5.5.130,CYMBELINE,"What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,"
31971,31972,Cymbeline,26.0,5.5.131,CYMBELINE,Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?

31973,31974,Cymbeline,27.0,5.5.133,IMOGEN,"Than I to your highness, who, being born your vassal,"
31974,31975,Cymbeline,27.0,5.5.134,IMOGEN,Am something nearer.
31975,31976,Cymbeline,28.0,5.5.135,CYMBELINE,Wherefore eyest him so?
31976,31977,Cymbeline,29.0,5.5.136,IMOGEN,"I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please"
31977,31978,Cymbeline,29.0,5.5.137,IMOGEN,To give me hearing.
31978,31979,Cymbeline,30.0,5.5.138,CYMBELINE,"Ay, with all my heart,"
31979,31980,Cymbeline,30.0,5.5.139,CYMBELINE,And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
31980,31981,Cymbeline,31.0,5.5.140,IMOGEN,"Fidele, sir."
31981,31982,Cymbeline,32.0,5.5.141,CYMBELINE,"Thou'rt my good youth, my page,"
31982,31983,Cymbeline,32.0,5.5.142,CYMBELINE,"I'll be thy master: walk with me, speak freely."
31983,31984,Cymbeline,32.0,,CYMBELINE,CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart
31984,31985,Cymbeline,33.0,5.5.143,BELARIUS,Is not this boy revived from death?

31986,31987,Cymbeline,34.0,5.5.145,ARVIRAGUS,Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
31987,31988,Cymbeline,34.0,5.5.146,ARVIRAGUS,"Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?"
31988,31989,Cymbeline,35.0,5.5.147,GUIDERIUS,The same dead thing alive.
31989,31990,Cymbeline,36.0,5.5.148,BELARIUS,"Peace, peace! see further, he eyes us not, forbear,"
31990,31991,Cymbeline,36.0,5.5.149,BELARIUS,"Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure"
31991,31992,Cymbeline,36.0,5.5.150,BELARIUS,He would have spoke to us.
31992,31993,Cymbeline,37.0,5.5.151,GUIDERIUS,But we saw him dead.
31993,31994,Cymbeline,38.0,5.5.152,BELARIUS,"Be silent, let's see further."
31994,31995,Cymbeline,39.0,5.5.153,PISANIO,[Aside]	It is my mistress:

32004,32005,Cymbeline,40.0,5.5.161,CYMBELINE,"Which is our honour, bitter torture shall"
32005,32006,Cymbeline,40.0,5.5.162,CYMBELINE,"Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him."
32006,32007,Cymbeline,41.0,5.5.163,IMOGEN,"My boon is, that this gentleman may render"
32007,32008,Cymbeline,41.0,5.5.164,IMOGEN,Of whom he had this ring.
32008,32009,Cymbeline,42.0,5.5.165,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,[Aside]                 What's that to him?
32009,32010,Cymbeline,43.0,5.5.166,CYMBELINE,"That diamond upon your finger, say"
32010,32011,Cymbeline,43.0,5.5.167,CYMBELINE,How came it yours?
32011,32012,Cymbeline,44.0,5.5.168,IACHIMO,Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
32012,32013,Cymbeline,44.0,5.5.169,IACHIMO,"Which, to be spoke, would torture thee."
32013,32014,Cymbeline,45.0,5.5.170,CYMBELINE,How! me?
32014,32015,Cymbeline,46.0,5.5.171,IACHIMO,I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
32015,32016,Cymbeline,46.0,5.5.172,IACHIMO,Which torments me to conceal. By villany
32016,32017,Cymbeline,46.0,5.5.173,IACHIMO,"I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel,"
32017,32018,Cymbeline,46.0,5.5.174,IACHIMO,"Whom thou didst banish, and--which more may"
32018,32019,Cymbeline,46.0,5.5.175,IACHIMO,"grieve thee,"
32019,32020,Cymbeline,46.0,5.5.176,IACHIMO,As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived

32021,32022,Cymbeline,47.0,5.5.178,CYMBELINE,All that belongs to this.

32026,32027,Cymbeline,49.0,5.5.183,CYMBELINE,I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
32027,32028,Cymbeline,49.0,5.5.184,CYMBELINE,"Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak."
32028,32029,Cymbeline,50.0,5.5.185,IACHIMO,"Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock"
32029,32030,Cymbeline,50.0,5.5.186,IACHIMO,"That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed"

32033,32034,Cymbeline,50.0,5.5.190,IACHIMO,What should I say? he was too good to be
32034,32035,Cymbeline,50.0,5.5.191,IACHIMO,"Where ill men were, and was the best of all"
32035,32036,Cymbeline,50.0,5.5.192,IACHIMO,"Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,"

32043,32044,Cymbeline,50.0,5.5.200,IACHIMO,Fairness which strikes the eye--
32044,32045,Cymbeline,51.0,5.5.201,CYMBELINE,I stand on fire:

32046,32047,Cymbeline,52.0,5.5.203,IACHIMO,"All too soon I shall,"
32047,32048,Cymbeline,52.0,5.5.204,IACHIMO,"Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,"
32048,32049,Cymbeline,52.0,5.5.205,IACHIMO,Most like a noble lord in love and one
32049,32050,Cymbeline,52.0,5.5.206,IACHIMO,"That had a royal lover, took his hint,"
32050,32051,Cymbeline,52.0,5.5.207,IACHIMO,"And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein"

32058,32059,Cymbeline,54.0,5.5.215,IACHIMO,Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
32059,32060,Cymbeline,54.0,5.5.216,IACHIMO,"He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,"
32060,32061,Cymbeline,54.0,5.5.217,IACHIMO,"And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,"
32061,32062,Cymbeline,54.0,5.5.218,IACHIMO,"Made scruple of his praise, and wager'd with him"
32062,32063,Cymbeline,54.0,5.5.219,IACHIMO,Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore

32195,32196,Cymbeline,88.0,5.5.350,GUIDERIUS,A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me

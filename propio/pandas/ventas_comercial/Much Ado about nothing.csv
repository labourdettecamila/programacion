69297,69298,Much Ado about nothing,104.0,5.1.428,PUCK,SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
69298,69299,Much Ado about nothing,104.0,,PUCK,"Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger"
69299,69300,Much Ado about nothing,1.0,1.1.1,LEONATO,I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
69300,69301,Much Ado about nothing,1.0,1.1.2,LEONATO,comes this night to Messina.
69301,69302,Much Ado about nothing,2.0,1.1.3,Messenger,He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
69302,69303,Much Ado about nothing,2.0,1.1.4,Messenger,when I left him.
69303,69304,Much Ado about nothing,3.0,1.1.5,LEONATO,How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
69304,69305,Much Ado about nothing,4.0,1.1.6,Messenger,"But few of any sort, and none of name."
69305,69306,Much Ado about nothing,5.0,1.1.7,LEONATO,A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
69306,69307,Much Ado about nothing,5.0,1.1.8,LEONATO,home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
69307,69308,Much Ado about nothing,5.0,1.1.9,LEONATO,bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
69308,69309,Much Ado about nothing,6.0,1.1.10,Messenger,Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
69309,69310,Much Ado about nothing,6.0,1.1.11,Messenger,Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
69310,69311,Much Ado about nothing,6.0,1.1.12,Messenger,"promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,"
69311,69312,Much Ado about nothing,6.0,1.1.13,Messenger,the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
69312,69313,Much Ado about nothing,6.0,1.1.14,Messenger,bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
69313,69314,Much Ado about nothing,6.0,1.1.15,Messenger,tell you how.
69314,69315,Much Ado about nothing,7.0,1.1.16,LEONATO,He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
69315,69316,Much Ado about nothing,7.0,1.1.17,LEONATO,glad of it.
69316,69317,Much Ado about nothing,8.0,1.1.18,Messenger,"I have already delivered him letters, and there"
69317,69318,Much Ado about nothing,8.0,1.1.19,Messenger,"appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could"
69318,69319,Much Ado about nothing,8.0,1.1.20,Messenger,not show itself modest enough without a badge of
69319,69320,Much Ado about nothing,8.0,1.1.21,Messenger,bitterness.
69320,69321,Much Ado about nothing,9.0,1.1.22,LEONATO,Did he break out into tears?
69321,69322,Much Ado about nothing,10.0,1.1.23,Messenger,In great measure.
69322,69323,Much Ado about nothing,11.0,1.1.24,LEONATO,A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
69323,69324,Much Ado about nothing,11.0,1.1.25,LEONATO,truer than those that are so washed. How much
69324,69325,Much Ado about nothing,11.0,1.1.26,LEONATO,better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
69325,69326,Much Ado about nothing,12.0,1.1.27,BEATRICE,"I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the"
69326,69327,Much Ado about nothing,12.0,1.1.28,BEATRICE,wars or no?
69327,69328,Much Ado about nothing,13.0,1.1.29,Messenger,"I know none of that name, lady: there was none such"
69328,69329,Much Ado about nothing,13.0,1.1.30,Messenger,in the army of any sort.
69329,69330,Much Ado about nothing,14.0,1.1.31,LEONATO,"What is he that you ask for, niece?"
69330,69331,Much Ado about nothing,15.0,1.1.32,HERO,My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
69331,69332,Much Ado about nothing,16.0,1.1.33,Messenger,"O, he's returned, and as pleasant as ever he was."
69332,69333,Much Ado about nothing,17.0,1.1.34,BEATRICE,He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
69333,69334,Much Ado about nothing,17.0,1.1.35,BEATRICE,"Cupid at the flight, and my uncle's fool, reading"
69334,69335,Much Ado about nothing,17.0,1.1.36,BEATRICE,"the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged"
69335,69336,Much Ado about nothing,17.0,1.1.37,BEATRICE,"him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he"
69336,69337,Much Ado about nothing,17.0,1.1.38,BEATRICE,killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
69337,69338,Much Ado about nothing,17.0,1.1.39,BEATRICE,he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
69338,69339,Much Ado about nothing,18.0,1.1.40,LEONATO,"Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much,"
69339,69340,Much Ado about nothing,18.0,1.1.41,LEONATO,"but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not."
69340,69341,Much Ado about nothing,19.0,1.1.42,Messenger,"He hath done good service, lady, in these wars."
69341,69342,Much Ado about nothing,20.0,1.1.43,BEATRICE,"You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:"
69342,69343,Much Ado about nothing,20.0,1.1.44,BEATRICE,"he is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an"
69343,69344,Much Ado about nothing,20.0,1.1.45,BEATRICE,excellent stomach.
69344,69345,Much Ado about nothing,21.0,1.1.46,Messenger,"And a good soldier too, lady."
69345,69346,Much Ado about nothing,22.0,1.1.47,BEATRICE,And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
69346,69347,Much Ado about nothing,23.0,1.1.48,Messenger,"A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all"
69347,69348,Much Ado about nothing,23.0,1.1.49,Messenger,honourable virtues.
69348,69349,Much Ado about nothing,24.0,1.1.50,BEATRICE,"It is so, indeed, he is no less than a stuffed man:"
69349,69350,Much Ado about nothing,24.0,1.1.51,BEATRICE,"but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal."
69350,69351,Much Ado about nothing,25.0,1.1.52,LEONATO,"You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a"
69351,69352,Much Ado about nothing,25.0,1.1.53,LEONATO,kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
69352,69353,Much Ado about nothing,25.0,1.1.54,LEONATO,they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
69353,69354,Much Ado about nothing,25.0,1.1.55,LEONATO,between them.
69354,69355,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.56,BEATRICE,Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
69355,69356,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.57,BEATRICE,"conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and"
69356,69357,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.58,BEATRICE,now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
69357,69358,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.59,BEATRICE,"he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him"
69358,69359,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.60,BEATRICE,bear it for a difference between himself and his
69359,69360,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.61,BEATRICE,"horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left,"
69360,69361,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.62,BEATRICE,to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
69361,69362,Much Ado about nothing,26.0,1.1.63,BEATRICE,companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
69362,69363,Much Ado about nothing,27.0,1.1.64,Messenger,Is't possible?
69363,69364,Much Ado about nothing,28.0,1.1.65,BEATRICE,Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
69364,69365,Much Ado about nothing,28.0,1.1.66,BEATRICE,"the fashion of his hat, it ever changes with the"
69365,69366,Much Ado about nothing,28.0,1.1.67,BEATRICE,next block.
69366,69367,Much Ado about nothing,29.0,1.1.68,Messenger,"I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books."
69367,69368,Much Ado about nothing,30.0,1.1.69,BEATRICE,"No, an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray"
69368,69369,Much Ado about nothing,30.0,1.1.70,BEATRICE,"you, who is his companion? Is there no young"
69369,69370,Much Ado about nothing,30.0,1.1.71,BEATRICE,squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
69370,69371,Much Ado about nothing,31.0,1.1.72,Messenger,He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
69371,69372,Much Ado about nothing,32.0,1.1.73,BEATRICE,"O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he"
69372,69373,Much Ado about nothing,32.0,1.1.74,BEATRICE,"is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker"
69373,69374,Much Ado about nothing,32.0,1.1.75,BEATRICE,runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
69374,69375,Much Ado about nothing,32.0,1.1.76,BEATRICE,"he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a"
69375,69376,Much Ado about nothing,32.0,1.1.77,BEATRICE,thousand pound ere a' be cured.
69376,69377,Much Ado about nothing,33.0,1.1.78,Messenger,"I will hold friends with you, lady."
69377,69378,Much Ado about nothing,34.0,1.1.79,BEATRICE,"Do, good friend."
69378,69379,Much Ado about nothing,35.0,1.1.80,LEONATO,"You will never run mad, niece."
69379,69380,Much Ado about nothing,36.0,1.1.81,BEATRICE,"No, not till a hot January."
69380,69381,Much Ado about nothing,37.0,1.1.82,Messenger,Don Pedro is approached.
69381,69382,Much Ado about nothing,37.0,,Messenger,"Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR"
69382,69383,Much Ado about nothing,38.0,1.1.83,DON PEDRO,"Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your"
69383,69384,Much Ado about nothing,38.0,1.1.84,DON PEDRO,trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
69384,69385,Much Ado about nothing,38.0,1.1.85,DON PEDRO,"cost, and you encounter it."
69385,69386,Much Ado about nothing,39.0,1.1.86,LEONATO,Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
69386,69387,Much Ado about nothing,39.0,1.1.87,LEONATO,"your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should"
69387,69388,Much Ado about nothing,39.0,1.1.88,LEONATO,"remain, but when you depart from me, sorrow abides"
69388,69389,Much Ado about nothing,39.0,1.1.89,LEONATO,and happiness takes his leave.
69389,69390,Much Ado about nothing,40.0,1.1.90,DON PEDRO,You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
69390,69391,Much Ado about nothing,40.0,1.1.91,DON PEDRO,is your daughter.
69391,69392,Much Ado about nothing,41.0,1.1.92,LEONATO,Her mother hath many times told me so.
69392,69393,Much Ado about nothing,42.0,1.1.93,BENEDICK,"Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?"
69393,69394,Much Ado about nothing,43.0,1.1.94,LEONATO,"Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child."
69394,69395,Much Ado about nothing,44.0,1.1.95,DON PEDRO,"You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this"
69395,69396,Much Ado about nothing,44.0,1.1.96,DON PEDRO,"what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers"
69396,69397,Much Ado about nothing,44.0,1.1.97,DON PEDRO,"herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an"
69397,69398,Much Ado about nothing,44.0,1.1.98,DON PEDRO,honourable father.
69398,69399,Much Ado about nothing,45.0,1.1.99,BENEDICK,"If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not"
69399,69400,Much Ado about nothing,45.0,1.1.100,BENEDICK,"have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as"
69400,69401,Much Ado about nothing,45.0,1.1.101,BENEDICK,like him as she is.
69401,69402,Much Ado about nothing,46.0,1.1.102,BEATRICE,"I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior"
69402,69403,Much Ado about nothing,46.0,1.1.103,BEATRICE,Benedick: nobody marks you.
69403,69404,Much Ado about nothing,47.0,1.1.104,BENEDICK,"What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?"
69404,69405,Much Ado about nothing,48.0,1.1.105,BEATRICE,Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
69405,69406,Much Ado about nothing,48.0,1.1.106,BEATRICE,such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
69406,69407,Much Ado about nothing,48.0,1.1.107,BEATRICE,"Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come"
69407,69408,Much Ado about nothing,48.0,1.1.108,BEATRICE,in her presence.
69408,69409,Much Ado about nothing,49.0,1.1.109,BENEDICK,Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
69409,69410,Much Ado about nothing,49.0,1.1.110,BENEDICK,"am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I"
69410,69411,Much Ado about nothing,49.0,1.1.111,BENEDICK,would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
69411,69412,Much Ado about nothing,49.0,1.1.112,BENEDICK,"heart, for, truly, I love none."
69412,69413,Much Ado about nothing,50.0,1.1.113,BEATRICE,A dear happiness to women: they would else have
69413,69414,Much Ado about nothing,50.0,1.1.114,BEATRICE,been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
69414,69415,Much Ado about nothing,50.0,1.1.115,BEATRICE,"and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I"
69415,69416,Much Ado about nothing,50.0,1.1.116,BEATRICE,had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
69416,69417,Much Ado about nothing,50.0,1.1.117,BEATRICE,swear he loves me.
69417,69418,Much Ado about nothing,51.0,1.1.118,BENEDICK,God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
69418,69419,Much Ado about nothing,51.0,1.1.119,BENEDICK,gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
69419,69420,Much Ado about nothing,51.0,1.1.120,BENEDICK,scratched face.
69420,69421,Much Ado about nothing,52.0,1.1.121,BEATRICE,"Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such"
69421,69422,Much Ado about nothing,52.0,1.1.122,BEATRICE,a face as yours were.
69422,69423,Much Ado about nothing,53.0,1.1.123,BENEDICK,"Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher."
69423,69424,Much Ado about nothing,54.0,1.1.124,BEATRICE,A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
69424,69425,Much Ado about nothing,55.0,1.1.125,BENEDICK,"I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and"
69425,69426,Much Ado about nothing,55.0,1.1.126,BENEDICK,"so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's"
69426,69427,Much Ado about nothing,55.0,1.1.127,BENEDICK,"name, I have done."
69427,69428,Much Ado about nothing,56.0,1.1.128,BEATRICE,You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
69428,69429,Much Ado about nothing,57.0,1.1.129,DON PEDRO,"That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio"
69429,69430,Much Ado about nothing,57.0,1.1.130,DON PEDRO,"and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath"
69430,69431,Much Ado about nothing,57.0,1.1.131,DON PEDRO,invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
69431,69432,Much Ado about nothing,57.0,1.1.132,DON PEDRO,"the least a month, and he heartily prays some"
69432,69433,Much Ado about nothing,57.0,1.1.133,DON PEDRO,occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
69433,69434,Much Ado about nothing,57.0,1.1.134,DON PEDRO,"hypocrite, but prays from his heart."
69434,69435,Much Ado about nothing,58.0,1.1.135,LEONATO,"If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn."
69435,69436,Much Ado about nothing,58.0,,LEONATO,To DON JOHN
69436,69437,Much Ado about nothing,58.0,1.1.136,LEONATO,"Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to"
69437,69438,Much Ado about nothing,58.0,1.1.137,LEONATO,"the prince your brother, I owe you all duty."
69438,69439,Much Ado about nothing,59.0,1.1.138,DON JOHN,"I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank"
69439,69440,Much Ado about nothing,59.0,1.1.139,DON JOHN,you.
69440,69441,Much Ado about nothing,60.0,1.1.140,LEONATO,Please it your grace lead on?
69441,69442,Much Ado about nothing,61.0,1.1.141,DON PEDRO,"Your hand, Leonato, we will go together."
69442,69443,Much Ado about nothing,61.0,,DON PEDRO,Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO
69443,69444,Much Ado about nothing,62.0,1.1.142,CLAUDIO,"Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?"
69444,69445,Much Ado about nothing,63.0,1.1.143,BENEDICK,"I noted her not, but I looked on her."
69445,69446,Much Ado about nothing,64.0,1.1.144,CLAUDIO,Is she not a modest young lady?
69446,69447,Much Ado about nothing,65.0,1.1.145,BENEDICK,"Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for"
69447,69448,Much Ado about nothing,65.0,1.1.146,BENEDICK,"my simple true judgment, or would you have me speak"
69448,69449,Much Ado about nothing,65.0,1.1.147,BENEDICK,"after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?"
69449,69450,Much Ado about nothing,66.0,1.1.148,CLAUDIO,"No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment."
69450,69451,Much Ado about nothing,67.0,1.1.149,BENEDICK,"Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high"
69451,69452,Much Ado about nothing,67.0,1.1.150,BENEDICK,"praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little"
69452,69453,Much Ado about nothing,67.0,1.1.151,BENEDICK,for a great praise: only this commendation I can
69453,69454,Much Ado about nothing,67.0,1.1.152,BENEDICK,"afford her, that were she other than she is, she"
69454,69455,Much Ado about nothing,67.0,1.1.153,BENEDICK,"were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I"
69455,69456,Much Ado about nothing,67.0,1.1.154,BENEDICK,do not like her.
69456,69457,Much Ado about nothing,68.0,1.1.155,CLAUDIO,Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
69457,69458,Much Ado about nothing,68.0,1.1.156,CLAUDIO,truly how thou likest her.
69458,69459,Much Ado about nothing,69.0,1.1.157,BENEDICK,"Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?"
69459,69460,Much Ado about nothing,70.0,1.1.158,CLAUDIO,Can the world buy such a jewel?
69460,69461,Much Ado about nothing,71.0,1.1.159,BENEDICK,"Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this"
69461,69462,Much Ado about nothing,71.0,1.1.160,BENEDICK,"with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,"
69462,69463,Much Ado about nothing,71.0,1.1.161,BENEDICK,to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
69463,69464,Much Ado about nothing,71.0,1.1.162,BENEDICK,"rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take"
69464,69465,Much Ado about nothing,71.0,1.1.163,BENEDICK,"you, to go in the song?"
69465,69466,Much Ado about nothing,72.0,1.1.164,CLAUDIO,In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
69466,69467,Much Ado about nothing,72.0,1.1.165,CLAUDIO,looked on.
69467,69468,Much Ado about nothing,73.0,1.1.166,BENEDICK,I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
69468,69469,Much Ado about nothing,73.0,1.1.167,BENEDICK,"matter: there's her cousin, an she were not"

70335,70336,Much Ado about nothing,75.0,2.3.212,BENEDICK,rather die than give any sign of affection. I did

70345,70346,Much Ado about nothing,75.0,2.3.222,BENEDICK,because I have railed so long against marriage: but

70418,70419,Much Ado about nothing,6.0,3.1.39,URSULA,That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
70419,70420,Much Ado about nothing,7.0,3.1.40,HERO,So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
70420,70421,Much Ado about nothing,8.0,3.1.41,URSULA,"And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?"

70450,70451,Much Ado about nothing,13.0,3.1.71,HERO,So turns she every man the wrong side out
70451,70452,Much Ado about nothing,13.0,3.1.72,HERO,And never gives to truth and virtue that

70453,70454,Much Ado about nothing,14.0,3.1.74,URSULA,"Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable."

70462,70463,Much Ado about nothing,15.0,3.1.83,HERO,Which is as bad as die with tickling.
70463,70464,Much Ado about nothing,16.0,3.1.84,URSULA,Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.

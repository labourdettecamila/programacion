6272,6273,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.79,GLOUCESTER,"His valour, coin and people, in the wars?"

6276,6277,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.83,GLOUCESTER,"And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,"
6277,6278,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.84,GLOUCESTER,To keep by policy what Henry got?
6278,6279,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.85,GLOUCESTER,"Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,"
6279,6280,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.86,GLOUCESTER,"Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,"
6280,6281,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.87,GLOUCESTER,Received deep scars in France and Normandy?

6286,6287,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.93,GLOUCESTER,And had his highness in his infancy
6287,6288,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.94,GLOUCESTER,Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?
6288,6289,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.95,GLOUCESTER,And shall these labours and these honours die?

6290,6291,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.97,GLOUCESTER,Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
6291,6292,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.98,GLOUCESTER,"O peers of England, shameful is this league!"
6292,6293,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.99,GLOUCESTER,"Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,"
6293,6294,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.100,GLOUCESTER,"Blotting your names from books of memory,"
6294,6295,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.101,GLOUCESTER,"Razing the characters of your renown,"
6295,6296,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.102,GLOUCESTER,"Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,"
6296,6297,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.1.103,GLOUCESTER,"Undoing all, as all had never been!"
6297,6298,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,1.1.104,CARDINAL,"Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,"
6298,6299,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,1.1.105,CARDINAL,This peroration with such circumstance?
6299,6300,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,1.1.106,CARDINAL,"For France, 'tis ours, and we will keep it still."
6300,6301,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.1.107,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can,"
6301,6302,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.1.108,GLOUCESTER,But now it is impossible we should:
6302,6303,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.1.109,GLOUCESTER,"Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,"
6303,6304,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.1.110,GLOUCESTER,Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
6304,6305,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.1.111,GLOUCESTER,"Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style"
6305,6306,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.1.112,GLOUCESTER,Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
6306,6307,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.1.113,SALISBURY,"Now, by the death of Him that died for all,"
6307,6308,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.1.114,SALISBURY,These counties were the keys of Normandy.
6308,6309,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.1.115,SALISBURY,"But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?"
6309,6310,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.116,WARWICK,For grief that they are past recovery:
6310,6311,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.117,WARWICK,"For, were there hope to conquer them again,"
6311,6312,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.118,WARWICK,"My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears."
6312,6313,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.119,WARWICK,"Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both,"
6313,6314,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.120,WARWICK,Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:
6314,6315,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.121,WARWICK,"And are the cities, that I got with wounds,"
6315,6316,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.122,WARWICK,Delivered up again with peaceful words?
6316,6317,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.1.123,WARWICK,Mort Dieu!
6317,6318,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.124,YORK,"For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,"
6318,6319,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.125,YORK,That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
6319,6320,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.126,YORK,"France should have torn and rent my very heart,"
6320,6321,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.127,YORK,Before I would have yielded to this league.
6321,6322,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.128,YORK,I never read but England's kings have had
6322,6323,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.129,YORK,Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
6323,6324,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.130,YORK,"And our King Henry gives away his own,"
6324,6325,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.1.131,YORK,To match with her that brings no vantages.
6325,6326,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.1.132,GLOUCESTER,"A proper jest, and never heard before,"
6326,6327,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.1.133,GLOUCESTER,That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
6327,6328,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.1.134,GLOUCESTER,For costs and charges in transporting her!
6328,6329,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.1.135,GLOUCESTER,She should have stayed in France and starved
6329,6330,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.1.136,GLOUCESTER,"in France, Before--"
6330,6331,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.1.137,CARDINAL,"My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:"
6331,6332,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.1.138,CARDINAL,It was the pleasure of my lord the King.
6332,6333,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.139,GLOUCESTER,"My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind,"
6333,6334,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.140,GLOUCESTER,"'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,"
6334,6335,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.141,GLOUCESTER,But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
6335,6336,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.142,GLOUCESTER,"Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face"
6336,6337,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.143,GLOUCESTER,"I see thy fury: if I longer stay,"
6337,6338,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.144,GLOUCESTER,We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
6338,6339,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.145,GLOUCESTER,"Lordings, farewell, and say, when I am gone,"
6339,6340,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.1.146,GLOUCESTER,I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
6340,6341,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,,GLOUCESTER,Exit
6341,6342,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.147,CARDINAL,"So, there goes our protector in a rage."
6342,6343,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.148,CARDINAL,"'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,"
6343,6344,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.149,CARDINAL,"Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,"
6344,6345,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.150,CARDINAL,"And no great friend, I fear me, to the king."
6345,6346,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.151,CARDINAL,"Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,"
6346,6347,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.152,CARDINAL,And heir apparent to the English crown:
6347,6348,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.153,CARDINAL,"Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,"
6348,6349,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.154,CARDINAL,"And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,"
6349,6350,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.155,CARDINAL,There's reason he should be displeased at it.
6350,6351,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.156,CARDINAL,"Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words"
6351,6352,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.157,CARDINAL,"Bewitch your hearts, be wise and circumspect."
6352,6353,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.158,CARDINAL,"What though the common people favour him,"
6353,6354,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.159,CARDINAL,"Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of"
6354,6355,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.160,CARDINAL,"Gloucester,'"
6355,6356,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.161,CARDINAL,"Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,"

6358,6359,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.164,CARDINAL,"I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,"
6359,6360,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.1.165,CARDINAL,He will be found a dangerous protector.
6360,6361,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,1.1.166,BUCKINGHAM,"Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,"
6361,6362,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,1.1.167,BUCKINGHAM,He being of age to govern of himself?
6362,6363,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,1.1.168,BUCKINGHAM,"Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,"
6363,6364,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,1.1.169,BUCKINGHAM,"And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,"
6364,6365,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,1.1.170,BUCKINGHAM,We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
6365,6366,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,1.1.171,CARDINAL,This weighty business will not brook delay:
6366,6367,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,1.1.172,CARDINAL,I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.

6370,6371,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,1.1.175,SOMERSET,Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:
6371,6372,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,1.1.176,SOMERSET,His insolence is more intolerable
6372,6373,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,1.1.177,SOMERSET,Than all the princes in the land beside:
6373,6374,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,1.1.178,SOMERSET,"If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector."
6374,6375,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,1.1.179,BUCKINGHAM,"Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,"
6375,6376,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,1.1.180,BUCKINGHAM,Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.

6379,6380,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.183,SALISBURY,Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
6380,6381,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.184,SALISBURY,I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
6381,6382,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.185,SALISBURY,Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
6382,6383,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.186,SALISBURY,"Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,"
6383,6384,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.187,SALISBURY,"More like a soldier than a man o' the church,"
6384,6385,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.188,SALISBURY,"As stout and proud as he were lord of all,"
6385,6386,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.189,SALISBURY,Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
6386,6387,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.190,SALISBURY,Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.

6401,6402,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.1.205,SALISBURY,While they do tend the profit of the land.
6402,6403,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,1.1.206,WARWICK,"So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,"
6403,6404,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,1.1.207,WARWICK,And common profit of his country!

6405,6406,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,1.1.209,SALISBURY,"Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main."
6406,6407,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,1.1.210,WARWICK,"Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost,"
6407,6408,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,1.1.211,WARWICK,"That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,"
6408,6409,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,1.1.212,WARWICK,And would have kept so long as breath did last!
6409,6410,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,1.1.213,WARWICK,"Main chance, father, you meant, but I meant Maine,"
6410,6411,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,1.1.214,WARWICK,"Which I will win from France, or else be slain,"

6417,6418,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.220,YORK,To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
6418,6419,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.221,YORK,I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
6419,6420,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.222,YORK,"'Tis thine they give away, and not their own."
6420,6421,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.223,YORK,Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
6421,6422,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.224,YORK,"And purchase friends and give to courtezans,"
6422,6423,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.225,YORK,"Still revelling like lords till all be gone,"
6423,6424,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.226,YORK,While as the silly owner of the goods
6424,6425,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.227,YORK,Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
6425,6426,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.228,YORK,"And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,"
6426,6427,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.229,YORK,"While all is shared and all is borne away,"
6427,6428,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.230,YORK,Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
6428,6429,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.231,YORK,"So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,"
6429,6430,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.232,YORK,While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
6430,6431,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.233,YORK,"Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland"
6431,6432,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.234,YORK,Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
6432,6433,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.235,YORK,As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd
6433,6434,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.236,YORK,Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
6434,6435,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.237,YORK,Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
6435,6436,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.238,YORK,"Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,"
6436,6437,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.239,YORK,Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
6437,6438,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.240,YORK,"A day will come when York shall claim his own,"
6438,6439,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.241,YORK,And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
6439,6440,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.242,YORK,"And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,"
6440,6441,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.243,YORK,"And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,"
6441,6442,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.244,YORK,For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:
6442,6443,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.245,YORK,"Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,"
6443,6444,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.246,YORK,"Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,"
6444,6445,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.247,YORK,"Nor wear the diadem upon his head,"
6445,6446,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.248,YORK,Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
6446,6447,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.249,YORK,"Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:"
6447,6448,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.250,YORK,"Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,"
6448,6449,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.251,YORK,"To pry into the secrets of the state,"
6449,6450,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.252,YORK,"Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,"
6450,6451,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.253,YORK,"With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,"
6451,6452,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.254,YORK,And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
6452,6453,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.255,YORK,"Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,"
6453,6454,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.256,YORK,"With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed,"
6454,6455,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.257,YORK,And in my standard bear the arms of York
6455,6456,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.258,YORK,"To grapple with the house of Lancaster,"
6456,6457,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.259,YORK,"And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,"
6457,6458,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.1.260,YORK,Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
6458,6459,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,,YORK,Exit
6459,6460,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,,YORK,SCENE II. GLOUCESTER'S house.
6460,6461,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,,YORK,Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS
6461,6462,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.1,DUCHESS,"Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,"
6462,6463,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.2,DUCHESS,Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
6463,6464,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.3,DUCHESS,"Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,"
6464,6465,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.4,DUCHESS,As frowning at the favours of the world?
6465,6466,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.5,DUCHESS,"Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,"
6466,6467,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.6,DUCHESS,Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
6467,6468,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.7,DUCHESS,"What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,"
6468,6469,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.8,DUCHESS,Enchased with all the honours of the world?
6469,6470,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.9,DUCHESS,"If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,"
6470,6471,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.10,DUCHESS,Until thy head be circled with the same.
6471,6472,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.11,DUCHESS,"Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold."
6472,6473,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.12,DUCHESS,"What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:"
6473,6474,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.13,DUCHESS,"And, having both together heaved it up,"
6474,6475,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.14,DUCHESS,"We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,"
6475,6476,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.15,DUCHESS,And never more abase our sight so low
6476,6477,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,1.2.16,DUCHESS,As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
6477,6478,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,1.2.17,GLOUCESTER,"O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,"
6478,6479,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,1.2.18,GLOUCESTER,Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.
6479,6480,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,1.2.19,GLOUCESTER,"And may that thought, when I imagine ill"
6480,6481,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,1.2.20,GLOUCESTER,"Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,"
6481,6482,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,1.2.21,GLOUCESTER,Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
6482,6483,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,1.2.22,GLOUCESTER,My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
6483,6484,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,1.2.23,DUCHESS,"What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it"
6484,6485,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,1.2.24,DUCHESS,With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
6485,6486,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,1.2.25,GLOUCESTER,"Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,"
6486,6487,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,1.2.26,GLOUCESTER,"Was broke in twain, by whom I have forgot,"
6487,6488,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,1.2.27,GLOUCESTER,"But, as I think, it was by the cardinal,"
6488,6489,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,1.2.28,GLOUCESTER,And on the pieces of the broken wand
6489,6490,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,1.2.29,GLOUCESTER,"Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,"
6490,6491,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,1.2.30,GLOUCESTER,"And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk."
6491,6492,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,1.2.31,GLOUCESTER,"This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows."
6492,6493,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.32,DUCHESS,"Tut, this was nothing but an argument"
6493,6494,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.33,DUCHESS,That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
6494,6495,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.34,DUCHESS,Shall lose his head for his presumption.
6495,6496,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.35,DUCHESS,"But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:"
6496,6497,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.36,DUCHESS,Methought I sat in seat of majesty
6497,6498,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.37,DUCHESS,"In the cathedral church of Westminster,"
6498,6499,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.38,DUCHESS,"And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd,"
6499,6500,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.39,DUCHESS,Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
6500,6501,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,1.2.40,DUCHESS,And on my head did set the diadem.
6501,6502,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.41,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:"
6502,6503,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.42,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,"
6503,6504,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.43,GLOUCESTER,"Art thou not second woman in the realm,"
6504,6505,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.44,GLOUCESTER,"And the protector's wife, beloved of him?"
6505,6506,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.45,GLOUCESTER,"Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,"
6506,6507,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.46,GLOUCESTER,Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
6507,6508,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.47,GLOUCESTER,"And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,"
6508,6509,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.48,GLOUCESTER,To tumble down thy husband and thyself
6509,6510,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.49,GLOUCESTER,From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
6510,6511,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,1.2.50,GLOUCESTER,"Away from me, and let me hear no more!"
6511,6512,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,1.2.51,DUCHESS,"What, what, my lord! are you so choleric"
6512,6513,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,1.2.52,DUCHESS,"With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?"
6513,6514,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,1.2.53,DUCHESS,"Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,"
6514,6515,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,1.2.54,DUCHESS,And not be cheque'd.
6515,6516,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,1.2.55,GLOUCESTER,"Nay, be not angry, I am pleased again."
6516,6517,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,,GLOUCESTER,Enter Messenger
6517,6518,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,1.2.56,Messenger,"My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure"
6518,6519,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,1.2.57,Messenger,"You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,"
6519,6520,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,1.2.58,Messenger,Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
6520,6521,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,1.2.59,GLOUCESTER,"I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?"
6521,6522,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.60,DUCHESS,"Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently."
6522,6523,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,,DUCHESS,Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger
6523,6524,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.61,DUCHESS,"Follow I must, I cannot go before,"
6524,6525,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.62,DUCHESS,While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
6525,6526,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.63,DUCHESS,"Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,"
6526,6527,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.64,DUCHESS,I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
6527,6528,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.65,DUCHESS,"And smooth my way upon their headless necks,"
6528,6529,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.66,DUCHESS,"And, being a woman, I will not be slack"
6529,6530,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.67,DUCHESS,To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
6530,6531,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.68,DUCHESS,"Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,"
6531,6532,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,1.2.69,DUCHESS,"We are alone, here's none but thee and I."
6532,6533,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,,DUCHESS,Enter HUME
6533,6534,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,1.2.70,HUME,Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
6534,6535,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,1.2.71,DUCHESS,What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.
6535,6536,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.2.72,HUME,"But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,"
6536,6537,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,1.2.73,HUME,Your grace's title shall be multiplied.
6537,6538,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,1.2.74,DUCHESS,"What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd"
6538,6539,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,1.2.75,DUCHESS,"With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,"
6539,6540,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,1.2.76,DUCHESS,"With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?"
6540,6541,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,1.2.77,DUCHESS,And will they undertake to do me good?
6541,6542,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.2.78,HUME,"This they have promised, to show your highness"
6542,6543,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.2.79,HUME,"A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,"
6543,6544,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.2.80,HUME,That shall make answer to such questions
6544,6545,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,1.2.81,HUME,As by your grace shall be propounded him.
6545,6546,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.2.82,DUCHESS,"It is enough, I'll think upon the questions:"
6546,6547,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.2.83,DUCHESS,"When from St. Alban's we do make return,"

6553,6554,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.89,HUME,"Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:"
6554,6555,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.90,HUME,The business asketh silent secrecy.
6555,6556,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.91,HUME,Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
6556,6557,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.92,HUME,"Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil."
6557,6558,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.93,HUME,"Yet have I gold flies from another coast,"

6561,6562,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.97,HUME,"They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,"
6562,6563,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.98,HUME,Have hired me to undermine the duchess
6563,6564,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.99,HUME,And buz these conjurations in her brain.
6564,6565,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.100,HUME,"They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker,'"
6565,6566,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.101,HUME,Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.

6567,6568,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.103,HUME,To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
6568,6569,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.104,HUME,"Well, so it stands, and thus, I fear, at last"
6569,6570,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.105,HUME,"Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,"
6570,6571,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.2.106,HUME,And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:

6621,6622,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.41,QUEEN MARGARET,Is this the fashion in the court of England?

6623,6624,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.43,QUEEN MARGARET,And this the royalty of Albion's king?
6624,6625,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.44,QUEEN MARGARET,What shall King Henry be a pupil still
6625,6626,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.45,QUEEN MARGARET,Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
6626,6627,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.46,QUEEN MARGARET,"Am I a queen in title and in style,"
6627,6628,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.47,QUEEN MARGARET,And must be made a subject to a duke?
6628,6629,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.48,QUEEN MARGARET,"I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours"
6629,6630,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.49,QUEEN MARGARET,Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
6630,6631,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.50,QUEEN MARGARET,"And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,"
6631,6632,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.51,QUEEN MARGARET,I thought King Henry had resembled thee
6632,6633,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.52,QUEEN MARGARET,"In courage, courtship and proportion:"
6633,6634,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.53,QUEEN MARGARET,"But all his mind is bent to holiness,"
6634,6635,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.54,QUEEN MARGARET,"To number Ave-Maries on his beads,"
6635,6636,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.55,QUEEN MARGARET,"His champions are the prophets and apostles,"
6636,6637,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.56,QUEEN MARGARET,"His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,"
6637,6638,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.57,QUEEN MARGARET,"His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves"
6638,6639,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.58,QUEEN MARGARET,Are brazen images of canonized saints.
6639,6640,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.59,QUEEN MARGARET,I would the college of the cardinals
6640,6641,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,"
6641,6642,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.61,QUEEN MARGARET,And set the triple crown upon his head:
6642,6643,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,1.3.62,QUEEN MARGARET,That were a state fit for his holiness.
6643,6644,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.3.63,SUFFOLK,"Madam, be patient: as I was cause"
6644,6645,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.3.64,SUFFOLK,"Your highness came to England, so will I"
6645,6646,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,1.3.65,SUFFOLK,In England work your grace's full content.
6646,6647,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.3.66,QUEEN MARGARET,"Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,"
6647,6648,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.3.67,QUEEN MARGARET,"The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,"
6648,6649,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.3.68,QUEEN MARGARET,And grumbling York: and not the least of these
6649,6650,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,1.3.69,QUEEN MARGARET,But can do more in England than the king.
6650,6651,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.3.70,SUFFOLK,And he of these that can do most of all
6651,6652,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.3.71,SUFFOLK,Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
6652,6653,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,1.3.72,SUFFOLK,Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
6653,6654,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.73,QUEEN MARGARET,Not all these lords do vex me half so much
6654,6655,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife."
6655,6656,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,"
6656,6657,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.76,QUEEN MARGARET,More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:
6657,6658,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.77,QUEEN MARGARET,Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
6658,6659,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"She bears a duke's revenues on her back,"
6659,6660,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.79,QUEEN MARGARET,And in her heart she scorns our poverty:
6660,6661,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.80,QUEEN MARGARET,Shall I not live to be avenged on her?
6661,6662,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,"
6662,6663,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,"
6663,6664,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.83,QUEEN MARGARET,The very train of her worst wearing gown
6664,6665,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.84,QUEEN MARGARET,"Was better worth than all my father's lands,"
6665,6666,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,1.3.85,QUEEN MARGARET,Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
6666,6667,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.86,SUFFOLK,"Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,"
6667,6668,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.87,SUFFOLK,"And placed a quire of such enticing birds,"
6668,6669,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.88,SUFFOLK,"That she will light to listen to the lays,"
6669,6670,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.89,SUFFOLK,And never mount to trouble you again.
6670,6671,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.90,SUFFOLK,"So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me,"
6671,6672,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.91,SUFFOLK,For I am bold to counsel you in this.
6672,6673,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.92,SUFFOLK,"Although we fancy not the cardinal,"
6673,6674,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.93,SUFFOLK,"Yet must we join with him and with the lords,"
6674,6675,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.94,SUFFOLK,Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
6675,6676,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.95,SUFFOLK,"As for the Duke of York, this late complaint"
6676,6677,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.96,SUFFOLK,Will make but little for his benefit.
6677,6678,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.97,SUFFOLK,"So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,"
6678,6679,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,1.3.98,SUFFOLK,And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
6679,6680,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,,SUFFOLK,"Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,  CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and the DUCHESS"
6680,6681,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.3.99,KING HENRY VI,"For my part, noble lords, I care not which,"
6681,6682,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,1.3.100,KING HENRY VI,"Or Somerset or York, all's one to me."
6682,6683,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,1.3.101,YORK,"If York have ill demean'd himself in France,"
6683,6684,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,1.3.102,YORK,Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
6684,6685,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,1.3.103,SOMERSET,"If Somerset be unworthy of the place,"
6685,6686,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,1.3.104,SOMERSET,"Let York be regent, I will yield to him."
6686,6687,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,1.3.105,WARWICK,"Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,"
6687,6688,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,1.3.106,WARWICK,Dispute not that: York is the worthier.
6688,6689,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,1.3.107,CARDINAL,"Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak."
6689,6690,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,1.3.108,WARWICK,The cardinal's not my better in the field.
6690,6691,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,1.3.109,BUCKINGHAM,"All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick."
6691,6692,Henry VI Part 2,30.0,1.3.110,WARWICK,Warwick may live to be the best of all.
6692,6693,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,1.3.111,SALISBURY,"Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,"
6693,6694,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,1.3.112,SALISBURY,Why Somerset should be preferred in this.
6694,6695,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,1.3.113,QUEEN MARGARET,"Because the king, forsooth, will have it so."
6695,6696,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.3.114,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, the king is old enough himself"
6696,6697,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,1.3.115,GLOUCESTER,To give his censure: these are no women's matters.
6697,6698,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,1.3.116,QUEEN MARGARET,"If he be old enough, what needs your grace"
6698,6699,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,1.3.117,QUEEN MARGARET,To be protector of his excellence?
6699,6700,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,1.3.118,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, I am protector of the realm,"
6700,6701,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,1.3.119,GLOUCESTER,"And, at his pleasure, will resign my place."
6701,6702,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,1.3.120,SUFFOLK,Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
6702,6703,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,1.3.121,SUFFOLK,Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
6703,6704,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,1.3.122,SUFFOLK,"The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck,"
6704,6705,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,1.3.123,SUFFOLK,"The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas,"
6705,6706,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,1.3.124,SUFFOLK,And all the peers and nobles of the realm
6706,6707,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,1.3.125,SUFFOLK,Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
6707,6708,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,1.3.126,CARDINAL,"The commons hast thou rack'd, the clergy's bags"
6708,6709,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,1.3.127,CARDINAL,Are lank and lean with thy extortions.

6710,6711,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,1.3.129,SOMERSET,Have cost a mass of public treasury.
6711,6712,Henry VI Part 2,39.0,1.3.130,BUCKINGHAM,Thy cruelty in execution
6712,6713,Henry VI Part 2,39.0,1.3.131,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,"
6713,6714,Henry VI Part 2,39.0,1.3.132,BUCKINGHAM,And left thee to the mercy of the law.
6714,6715,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,1.3.133,QUEEN MARGARET,"They sale of offices and towns in France,"
6715,6716,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,1.3.134,QUEEN MARGARET,"If they were known, as the suspect is great,"
6716,6717,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,1.3.135,QUEEN MARGARET,Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.

6718,6719,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,1.3.136,QUEEN MARGARET,"Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?"
6719,6720,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear
6720,6721,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,1.3.137,QUEEN MARGARET,"I cry you mercy, madam, was it you?"

6723,6724,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,1.3.140,DUCHESS,I'd set my ten commandments in your face.

6725,6726,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,1.3.142,DUCHESS,"Against her will! good king, look to't in time,"
6726,6727,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,1.3.143,DUCHESS,"She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:"

6914,6915,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,2.1.6,KING HENRY VI,And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
6915,6916,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,2.1.7,KING HENRY VI,To see how God in all his creatures works!
6916,6917,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,2.1.8,KING HENRY VI,"Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high."

6924,6925,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,2.1.16,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?"

7096,7097,Henry VI Part 2,100.0,2.1.179,BUCKINGHAM,"The ringleader and head of all this rout,"
7097,7098,Henry VI Part 2,100.0,2.1.180,BUCKINGHAM,"Have practised dangerously against your state,"
7098,7099,Henry VI Part 2,100.0,2.1.181,BUCKINGHAM,Dealing with witches and with conjurers:
7099,7100,Henry VI Part 2,100.0,2.1.182,BUCKINGHAM,"Whom we have apprehended in the fact,"

7105,7106,Henry VI Part 2,101.0,2.1.188,CARDINAL,by this means
7106,7107,Henry VI Part 2,101.0,2.1.189,CARDINAL,Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
7107,7108,Henry VI Part 2,101.0,2.1.190,CARDINAL,"This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge,"
7108,7109,Henry VI Part 2,101.0,2.1.191,CARDINAL,"'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour."
7109,7110,Henry VI Part 2,102.0,2.1.192,GLOUCESTER,"Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:"
7110,7111,Henry VI Part 2,102.0,2.1.193,GLOUCESTER,"Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers,"
7111,7112,Henry VI Part 2,102.0,2.1.194,GLOUCESTER,"And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,"
7112,7113,Henry VI Part 2,102.0,2.1.195,GLOUCESTER,Or to the meanest groom.
7113,7114,Henry VI Part 2,103.0,2.1.196,KING HENRY VI,"O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,"
7114,7115,Henry VI Part 2,103.0,2.1.197,KING HENRY VI,Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
7115,7116,Henry VI Part 2,104.0,2.1.198,QUEEN MARGARET,"Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest."
7116,7117,Henry VI Part 2,104.0,2.1.199,QUEEN MARGARET,"And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best."
7117,7118,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.200,GLOUCESTER,"Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,"
7118,7119,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.201,GLOUCESTER,How I have loved my king and commonweal:
7119,7120,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.202,GLOUCESTER,"And, for my wife, I know not how it stands,"
7120,7121,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.203,GLOUCESTER,Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
7121,7122,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.204,GLOUCESTER,"Noble she is, but if she have forgot"
7122,7123,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.205,GLOUCESTER,Honour and virtue and conversed with such
7123,7124,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.206,GLOUCESTER,"As, like to pitch, defile nobility,"
7124,7125,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.207,GLOUCESTER,I banish her my bed and company
7125,7126,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.208,GLOUCESTER,"And give her as a prey to law and shame,"
7126,7127,Henry VI Part 2,105.0,2.1.209,GLOUCESTER,That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.
7127,7128,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,2.1.210,KING HENRY VI,"Well, for this night we will repose us here:"
7128,7129,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,2.1.211,KING HENRY VI,"To-morrow toward London back again,"
7129,7130,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,2.1.212,KING HENRY VI,To look into this business thoroughly
7130,7131,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,2.1.213,KING HENRY VI,And call these foul offenders to their answers
7131,7132,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,2.1.214,KING HENRY VI,"And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,"
7132,7133,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,2.1.215,KING HENRY VI,"Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails."
7133,7134,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,,KING HENRY VI,Flourish. Exeunt

7135,7136,Henry VI Part 2,106.0,,KING HENRY VI,"Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK"
7136,7137,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,2.2.1,YORK,"Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,"
7137,7138,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,2.2.2,YORK,"Our simple supper ended, give me leave"
7138,7139,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,2.2.3,YORK,"In this close walk to satisfy myself,"
7139,7140,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,2.2.4,YORK,"In craving your opinion of my title,"
7140,7141,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,2.2.5,YORK,"Which is infallible, to England's crown."
7141,7142,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,2.2.6,SALISBURY,"My lord, I long to hear it at full."
7142,7143,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,2.2.7,WARWICK,"Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,"
7143,7144,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,2.2.8,WARWICK,The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
7144,7145,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.9,YORK,Then thus:
7145,7146,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.10,YORK,"Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:"
7146,7147,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.11,YORK,"The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales,"
7147,7148,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.12,YORK,"The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,"
7148,7149,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.13,YORK,Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
7149,7150,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.14,YORK,"Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster,"
7150,7151,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.15,YORK,"The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York,"
7151,7152,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.16,YORK,"The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester,"
7152,7153,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.17,YORK,William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
7153,7154,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.18,YORK,Edward the Black Prince died before his father
7154,7155,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.19,YORK,"And left behind him Richard, his only son,"
7155,7156,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.20,YORK,"Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king,"
7156,7157,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.21,YORK,"Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,"

7158,7159,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.23,YORK,"Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,"
7159,7160,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.24,YORK,"Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,"
7160,7161,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.25,YORK,"Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,"
7161,7162,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.26,YORK,"And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,"
7162,7163,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.2.27,YORK,Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
7163,7164,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,2.2.28,WARWICK,"Father, the duke hath told the truth:"
7164,7165,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,2.2.29,WARWICK,Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
7165,7166,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,2.2.30,YORK,"Which now they hold by force and not by right,"
7166,7167,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,2.2.31,YORK,"For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,"
7167,7168,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,2.2.32,YORK,The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
7168,7169,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,2.2.33,SALISBURY,But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
7169,7170,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,2.2.34,YORK,"The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line"
7170,7171,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,2.2.35,YORK,"I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,"
7171,7172,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,2.2.36,YORK,"Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:"
7172,7173,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,2.2.37,YORK,"Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March,"
7173,7174,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,2.2.38,YORK,"Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor."
7174,7175,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,2.2.39,SALISBURY,"This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,"
7175,7176,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,2.2.40,SALISBURY,"As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,"
7176,7177,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,2.2.41,SALISBURY,"And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,"
7177,7178,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,2.2.42,SALISBURY,Who kept him in captivity till he died.
7178,7179,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,2.2.43,SALISBURY,But to the rest.
7179,7180,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.44,YORK,"His eldest sister, Anne,"
7180,7181,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.45,YORK,"My mother, being heir unto the crown"
7181,7182,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.46,YORK,"Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was son"
7182,7183,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.47,YORK,"To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son."
7183,7184,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.48,YORK,By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
7184,7185,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.49,YORK,"To Roger Earl of March, who was the son"
7185,7186,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.50,YORK,"Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,"
7186,7187,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.51,YORK,Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:
7187,7188,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.52,YORK,"So, if the issue of the elder son"
7188,7189,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,2.2.53,YORK,"Succeed before the younger, I am king."
7189,7190,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.54,WARWICK,What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
7190,7191,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.55,WARWICK,"Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,"
7191,7192,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.56,WARWICK,"The fourth son, York claims it from the third."
7192,7193,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.57,WARWICK,"Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:"
7193,7194,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.58,WARWICK,"It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee"
7194,7195,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.59,WARWICK,"And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock."
7195,7196,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.60,WARWICK,"Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,"
7196,7197,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.61,WARWICK,And in this private plot be we the first
7197,7198,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.62,WARWICK,That shall salute our rightful sovereign
7198,7199,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,2.2.63,WARWICK,With honour of his birthright to the crown.
7199,7200,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,2.2.64,BOTH,"Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!"
7200,7201,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.65,YORK,"We thank you, lords. But I am not your king"
7201,7202,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.66,YORK,Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
7202,7203,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.67,YORK,"With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster,"
7203,7204,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.68,YORK,"And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,"
7204,7205,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.69,YORK,But with advice and silent secrecy.
7205,7206,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.70,YORK,Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
7206,7207,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.71,YORK,"Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,"
7207,7208,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.72,YORK,"At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,"
7208,7209,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.73,YORK,"At Buckingham and all the crew of them,"
7209,7210,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.74,YORK,"Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,"
7210,7211,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.75,YORK,"That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:"
7211,7212,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.76,YORK,"'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that"
7212,7213,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,2.2.77,YORK,"Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy."
7213,7214,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,2.2.78,SALISBURY,"My lord, break we off, we know your mind at full."
7214,7215,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,2.2.79,WARWICK,My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
7215,7216,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,2.2.80,WARWICK,Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
7216,7217,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,2.2.81,YORK,"And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:"
7217,7218,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,2.2.82,YORK,Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
7218,7219,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,2.2.83,YORK,The greatest man in England but the king.

7243,7244,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,2.3.21,GLOUCESTER,Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
7244,7245,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.3.22,KING HENRY VI,"Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,"
7245,7246,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,2.3.23,KING HENRY VI,Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself

7447,7448,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,,DUCHESS,SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.
7448,7449,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,,DUCHESS,"Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN  MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament"
7449,7450,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,3.1.1,KING HENRY VI,I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
7450,7451,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,3.1.2,KING HENRY VI,"'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,"
7451,7452,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,3.1.3,KING HENRY VI,Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
7452,7453,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.4,QUEEN MARGARET,Can you not see? or will ye not observe
7453,7454,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.5,QUEEN MARGARET,The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
7454,7455,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.6,QUEEN MARGARET,"With what a majesty he bears himself,"
7455,7456,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.7,QUEEN MARGARET,"How insolent of late he is become,"
7456,7457,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.8,QUEEN MARGARET,"How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?"
7457,7458,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.9,QUEEN MARGARET,"We know the time since he was mild and affable,"
7458,7459,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.10,QUEEN MARGARET,"And if we did but glance a far-off look,"
7459,7460,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.11,QUEEN MARGARET,"Immediately he was upon his knee,"
7460,7461,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.12,QUEEN MARGARET,That all the court admired him for submission:
7461,7462,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.13,QUEEN MARGARET,"But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,"
7462,7463,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.14,QUEEN MARGARET,"When every one will give the time of day,"
7463,7464,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.15,QUEEN MARGARET,"He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,"
7464,7465,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.16,QUEEN MARGARET,"And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,"
7465,7466,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.17,QUEEN MARGARET,Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
7466,7467,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.18,QUEEN MARGARET,"Small curs are not regarded when they grin,"
7467,7468,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.19,QUEEN MARGARET,"But great men tremble when the lion roars,"
7468,7469,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.20,QUEEN MARGARET,And Humphrey is no little man in England.
7469,7470,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.21,QUEEN MARGARET,"First note that he is near you in descent,"
7470,7471,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.22,QUEEN MARGARET,"And should you fall, he as the next will mount."
7471,7472,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.23,QUEEN MARGARET,"Me seemeth then it is no policy,"
7472,7473,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.24,QUEEN MARGARET,Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
7473,7474,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.25,QUEEN MARGARET,"And his advantage following your decease,"
7474,7475,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.26,QUEEN MARGARET,That he should come about your royal person
7475,7476,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.27,QUEEN MARGARET,Or be admitted to your highness' council.
7476,7477,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.28,QUEEN MARGARET,"By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,"
7477,7478,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.29,QUEEN MARGARET,"And when he please to make commotion,"
7478,7479,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.30,QUEEN MARGARET,'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
7479,7480,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.31,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted,"
7480,7481,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.32,QUEEN MARGARET,"Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden"
7481,7482,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.33,QUEEN MARGARET,And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
7482,7483,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.34,QUEEN MARGARET,The reverent care I bear unto my lord
7483,7484,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.35,QUEEN MARGARET,Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
7484,7485,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.36,QUEEN MARGARET,"If it be fond, call it a woman's fear,"
7485,7486,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.37,QUEEN MARGARET,"Which fear if better reasons can supplant,"
7486,7487,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.38,QUEEN MARGARET,I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
7487,7488,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.39,QUEEN MARGARET,"My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,"
7488,7489,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.40,QUEEN MARGARET,"Reprove my allegation, if you can,"
7489,7490,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.1.41,QUEEN MARGARET,Or else conclude my words effectual.
7490,7491,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.42,SUFFOLK,"Well hath your highness seen into this duke,"
7491,7492,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.43,SUFFOLK,"And, had I first been put to speak my mind,"
7492,7493,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.44,SUFFOLK,I think I should have told your grace's tale.
7493,7494,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.45,SUFFOLK,"The duchess, by his subornation,"
7494,7495,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.46,SUFFOLK,"Upon my life, began her devilish practises:"
7495,7496,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.47,SUFFOLK,"Or, if he were not privy to those faults,"
7496,7497,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.48,SUFFOLK,"Yet, by reputing of his high descent,"
7497,7498,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.49,SUFFOLK,"As next the king he was successive heir,"
7498,7499,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.50,SUFFOLK,"And such high vaunts of his nobility,"
7499,7500,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.51,SUFFOLK,Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
7500,7501,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.52,SUFFOLK,By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
7501,7502,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.53,SUFFOLK,"Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,"
7502,7503,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.54,SUFFOLK,And in his simple show he harbours treason.
7503,7504,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.55,SUFFOLK,The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
7504,7505,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.56,SUFFOLK,"No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man"
7505,7506,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.1.57,SUFFOLK,Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
7506,7507,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,3.1.58,CARDINAL,"Did he not, contrary to form of law,"
7507,7508,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,3.1.59,CARDINAL,Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
7508,7509,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.1.60,YORK,"And did he not, in his protectorship,"
7509,7510,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.1.61,YORK,Levy great sums of money through the realm
7510,7511,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.1.62,YORK,"For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?"
7511,7512,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.1.63,YORK,By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
7512,7513,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,3.1.64,BUCKINGHAM,"Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown."
7513,7514,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,3.1.65,BUCKINGHAM,Which time will bring to light in smooth
7514,7515,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,3.1.66,BUCKINGHAM,Duke Humphrey.
7515,7516,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.67,KING HENRY VI,"My lords, at once: the care you have of us,"
7516,7517,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.68,KING HENRY VI,"To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,"
7517,7518,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.69,KING HENRY VI,"Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,"
7518,7519,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.70,KING HENRY VI,Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
7519,7520,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.71,KING HENRY VI,From meaning treason to our royal person
7520,7521,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.72,KING HENRY VI,As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
7521,7522,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.73,KING HENRY VI,"The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given"
7522,7523,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,3.1.74,KING HENRY VI,To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
7523,7524,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!"
7524,7525,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,"
7525,7526,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.77,QUEEN MARGARET,For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
7526,7527,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,"
7527,7528,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.79,QUEEN MARGARET,For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.
7528,7529,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.80,QUEEN MARGARET,Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
7529,7530,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all"
7530,7531,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,3.1.82,QUEEN MARGARET,Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
7531,7532,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Enter SOMERSET
7532,7533,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,3.1.83,SOMERSET,All health unto my gracious sovereign!
7533,7534,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,3.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?"
7534,7535,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,3.1.85,SOMERSET,That all your interest in those territories
7535,7536,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,3.1.86,SOMERSET,"Is utterly bereft you, all is lost."
7536,7537,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,3.1.87,KING HENRY VI,"Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!"
7537,7538,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.1.88,YORK,"[Aside]  Cold news for me, for I had hope of France"
7538,7539,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.1.89,YORK,As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
7539,7540,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.1.90,YORK,Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
7540,7541,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.1.91,YORK,"And caterpillars eat my leaves away,"
7541,7542,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.1.92,YORK,"But I will remedy this gear ere long,"
7542,7543,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.1.93,YORK,Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
7543,7544,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,,YORK,Enter GLOUCESTER
7544,7545,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,3.1.94,GLOUCESTER,All happiness unto my lord the king!
7545,7546,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,3.1.95,GLOUCESTER,"Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long."
7546,7547,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,3.1.96,SUFFOLK,"Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,"
7547,7548,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,3.1.97,SUFFOLK,Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
7548,7549,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,3.1.98,SUFFOLK,I do arrest thee of high treason here.
7549,7550,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.1.99,GLOUCESTER,"Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush"
7550,7551,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.1.100,GLOUCESTER,Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
7551,7552,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.1.101,GLOUCESTER,A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
7552,7553,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.1.102,GLOUCESTER,The purest spring is not so free from mud
7553,7554,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.1.103,GLOUCESTER,As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:
7554,7555,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.1.104,GLOUCESTER,Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?
7555,7556,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,3.1.105,YORK,"'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,"
7556,7557,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,3.1.106,YORK,"And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay,"
7557,7558,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,3.1.107,YORK,By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
7558,7559,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.108,GLOUCESTER,Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?
7559,7560,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.109,GLOUCESTER,"I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,"
7560,7561,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.110,GLOUCESTER,Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
7561,7562,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.111,GLOUCESTER,"So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,"
7562,7563,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.112,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,"
7563,7564,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.113,GLOUCESTER,"That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,"
7564,7565,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.114,GLOUCESTER,"Or any groat I hoarded to my use,"
7565,7566,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.115,GLOUCESTER,Be brought against me at my trial-day!
7566,7567,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.116,GLOUCESTER,"No, many a pound of mine own proper store,"
7567,7568,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.117,GLOUCESTER,"Because I would not tax the needy commons,"
7568,7569,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.118,GLOUCESTER,"Have I disbursed to the garrisons,"
7569,7570,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.1.119,GLOUCESTER,And never ask'd for restitution.
7570,7571,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,3.1.120,CARDINAL,"It serves you well, my lord, to say so much."
7571,7572,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,3.1.121,GLOUCESTER,"I say no more than truth, so help me God!"
7572,7573,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,3.1.122,YORK,In your protectorship you did devise
7573,7574,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,3.1.123,YORK,"Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,"
7574,7575,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,3.1.124,YORK,That England was defamed by tyranny.
7575,7576,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.125,GLOUCESTER,"Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was"
7576,7577,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.126,GLOUCESTER,"protector,"
7577,7578,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.127,GLOUCESTER,"Pity was all the fault that was in me,"
7578,7579,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.128,GLOUCESTER,"For I should melt at an offender's tears,"
7579,7580,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.129,GLOUCESTER,And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
7580,7581,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.130,GLOUCESTER,"Unless it were a bloody murderer,"
7581,7582,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.131,GLOUCESTER,"Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,"
7582,7583,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.132,GLOUCESTER,I never gave them condign punishment:
7583,7584,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.133,GLOUCESTER,"Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured"
7584,7585,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.1.134,GLOUCESTER,Above the felon or what trespass else.
7585,7586,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,3.1.135,SUFFOLK,"My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:"
7586,7587,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,3.1.136,SUFFOLK,"But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,"
7587,7588,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,3.1.137,SUFFOLK,Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
7588,7589,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,3.1.138,SUFFOLK,"I do arrest you in his highness' name,"
7589,7590,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,3.1.139,SUFFOLK,And here commit you to my lord cardinal
7590,7591,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,3.1.140,SUFFOLK,"To keep, until your further time of trial."
7591,7592,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.1.141,KING HENRY VI,"My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope"
7592,7593,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.1.142,KING HENRY VI,That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
7593,7594,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.1.143,KING HENRY VI,My conscience tells me you are innocent.
7594,7595,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.144,GLOUCESTER,"Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:"
7595,7596,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.145,GLOUCESTER,Virtue is choked with foul ambition
7596,7597,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.146,GLOUCESTER,"And charity chased hence by rancour's hand,"
7597,7598,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.147,GLOUCESTER,Foul subornation is predominant
7598,7599,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.148,GLOUCESTER,And equity exiled your highness' land.
7599,7600,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.149,GLOUCESTER,"I know their complot is to have my life,"
7600,7601,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.150,GLOUCESTER,"And if my death might make this island happy,"
7601,7602,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.151,GLOUCESTER,"And prove the period of their tyranny,"
7602,7603,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.152,GLOUCESTER,I would expend it with all willingness:
7603,7604,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.153,GLOUCESTER,"But mine is made the prologue to their play,"
7604,7605,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.154,GLOUCESTER,"For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,"
7605,7606,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.155,GLOUCESTER,Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
7606,7607,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.156,GLOUCESTER,"Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,"
7607,7608,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.157,GLOUCESTER,"And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate,"
7608,7609,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.158,GLOUCESTER,Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
7609,7610,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.159,GLOUCESTER,"The envious load that lies upon his heart,"
7610,7611,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.160,GLOUCESTER,"And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,"
7611,7612,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.161,GLOUCESTER,"Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,"
7612,7613,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.162,GLOUCESTER,By false accuse doth level at my life:
7613,7614,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.163,GLOUCESTER,"And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,"
7614,7615,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.164,GLOUCESTER,"Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,"
7615,7616,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.165,GLOUCESTER,And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
7616,7617,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.166,GLOUCESTER,My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
7617,7618,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.167,GLOUCESTER,"Ay, all you have laid your heads together--"
7618,7619,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.168,GLOUCESTER,Myself had notice of your conventicles--
7619,7620,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.169,GLOUCESTER,And all to make away my guiltless life.
7620,7621,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.170,GLOUCESTER,"I shall not want false witness to condemn me,"
7621,7622,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.171,GLOUCESTER,"Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt,"
7622,7623,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.172,GLOUCESTER,The ancient proverb will be well effected:
7623,7624,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.1.173,GLOUCESTER,'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
7624,7625,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,3.1.174,CARDINAL,"My liege, his railing is intolerable:"
7625,7626,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,3.1.175,CARDINAL,If those that care to keep your royal person
7626,7627,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,3.1.176,CARDINAL,From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
7627,7628,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,3.1.177,CARDINAL,"Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,"
7628,7629,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,3.1.178,CARDINAL,"And the offender granted scope of speech,"
7629,7630,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,3.1.179,CARDINAL,'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.
7630,7631,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.1.180,SUFFOLK,Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
7631,7632,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.1.181,SUFFOLK,"With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,"
7632,7633,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.1.182,SUFFOLK,As if she had suborned some to swear
7633,7634,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.1.183,SUFFOLK,False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
7634,7635,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.1.184,QUEEN MARGARET,But I can give the loser leave to chide.
7635,7636,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,3.1.185,GLOUCESTER,"Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed,"
7636,7637,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,3.1.186,GLOUCESTER,"Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!"
7637,7638,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,3.1.187,GLOUCESTER,And well such losers may have leave to speak.
7638,7639,Henry VI Part 2,30.0,3.1.188,BUCKINGHAM,He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:
7639,7640,Henry VI Part 2,30.0,3.1.189,BUCKINGHAM,"Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner."
7640,7641,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.1.190,CARDINAL,"Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure."
7641,7642,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,3.1.191,GLOUCESTER,Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
7642,7643,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,3.1.192,GLOUCESTER,Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
7643,7644,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,3.1.193,GLOUCESTER,"Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,"
7644,7645,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,3.1.194,GLOUCESTER,And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.

7646,7647,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,3.1.196,GLOUCESTER,"For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear."
7647,7648,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,,GLOUCESTER,"Exit, guarded"
7648,7649,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,3.1.197,KING HENRY VI,"My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,"

7650,7651,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,3.1.199,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, will your highness leave the parliament?"
7651,7652,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.200,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, Margaret, my heart is drown'd with grief,"
7652,7653,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.201,KING HENRY VI,"Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,"
7653,7654,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.202,KING HENRY VI,"My body round engirt with misery,"
7654,7655,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.203,KING HENRY VI,For what's more miserable than discontent?
7655,7656,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.204,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see"
7656,7657,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.205,KING HENRY VI,"The map of honour, truth and loyalty:"
7657,7658,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.206,KING HENRY VI,"And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come"
7658,7659,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.207,KING HENRY VI,That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
7659,7660,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.208,KING HENRY VI,"What louring star now envies thy estate,"
7660,7661,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.209,KING HENRY VI,That these great lords and Margaret our queen
7661,7662,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.210,KING HENRY VI,Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
7662,7663,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.211,KING HENRY VI,"Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong,"
7663,7664,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.212,KING HENRY VI,And as the butcher takes away the calf
7664,7665,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.213,KING HENRY VI,"And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,"
7665,7666,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.214,KING HENRY VI,"Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,"
7666,7667,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.215,KING HENRY VI,"Even so remorseless have they borne him hence,"
7667,7668,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.216,KING HENRY VI,"And as the dam runs lowing up and down,"
7668,7669,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.217,KING HENRY VI,"Looking the way her harmless young one went,"
7669,7670,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.218,KING HENRY VI,"And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,"
7670,7671,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.219,KING HENRY VI,Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
7671,7672,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.220,KING HENRY VI,"With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes"
7672,7673,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.221,KING HENRY VI,"Look after him and cannot do him good,"
7673,7674,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.222,KING HENRY VI,So mighty are his vowed enemies.
7674,7675,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.223,KING HENRY VI,"His fortunes I will weep, and, 'twixt each groan"
7675,7676,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.224,KING HENRY VI,Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'
7676,7677,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.1.224,KING HENRY VI,"Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK, SOMERSET remains apart"
7677,7678,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.225,QUEEN MARGARET,"Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams."
7678,7679,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.226,QUEEN MARGARET,"Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,"
7679,7680,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.227,QUEEN MARGARET,"Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show"
7680,7681,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.228,QUEEN MARGARET,Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
7681,7682,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.229,QUEEN MARGARET,"With sorrow snares relenting passengers,"
7682,7683,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.230,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,"
7683,7684,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.231,QUEEN MARGARET,"With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child"
7684,7685,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.232,QUEEN MARGARET,That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
7685,7686,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.233,QUEEN MARGARET,"Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--"
7686,7687,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.234,QUEEN MARGARET,And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--
7687,7688,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.235,QUEEN MARGARET,"This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,"
7688,7689,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.1.236,QUEEN MARGARET,To rid us of the fear we have of him.
7689,7690,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,3.1.237,CARDINAL,"That he should die is worthy policy,"
7690,7691,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,3.1.238,CARDINAL,But yet we want a colour for his death:
7691,7692,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,3.1.239,CARDINAL,'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
7692,7693,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.1.240,SUFFOLK,"But, in my mind, that were no policy:"
7693,7694,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.1.241,SUFFOLK,"The king will labour still to save his life,"
7694,7695,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.1.242,SUFFOLK,"The commons haply rise, to save his life,"
7695,7696,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.1.243,SUFFOLK,"And yet we have but trivial argument,"
7696,7697,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.1.244,SUFFOLK,"More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death."
7697,7698,Henry VI Part 2,39.0,3.1.245,YORK,"So that, by this, you would not have him die."
7698,7699,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.1.246,SUFFOLK,"Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!"
7699,7700,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.1.247,YORK,'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
7700,7701,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.1.248,YORK,"But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,"
7701,7702,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.1.249,YORK,"Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,"
7702,7703,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.1.250,YORK,"Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set"
7703,7704,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.1.251,YORK,"To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,"
7704,7705,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.1.252,YORK,As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?
7705,7706,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,3.1.253,QUEEN MARGARET,So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
7706,7707,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.254,SUFFOLK,"Madam, 'tis true, and were't not madness, then,"
7707,7708,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.255,SUFFOLK,To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
7708,7709,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.256,SUFFOLK,"Who being accused a crafty murderer,"
7709,7710,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.257,SUFFOLK,"His guilt should be but idly posted over,"
7710,7711,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.258,SUFFOLK,Because his purpose is not executed.
7711,7712,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.259,SUFFOLK,"No, let him die, in that he is a fox,"
7712,7713,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.260,SUFFOLK,"By nature proved an enemy to the flock,"
7713,7714,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.261,SUFFOLK,"Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,"
7714,7715,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.262,SUFFOLK,"As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege."
7715,7716,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.263,SUFFOLK,And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
7716,7717,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.264,SUFFOLK,"Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,"
7717,7718,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.265,SUFFOLK,"Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,"
7718,7719,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.266,SUFFOLK,"So he be dead, for that is good deceit"
7719,7720,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.1.267,SUFFOLK,Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
7720,7721,Henry VI Part 2,44.0,3.1.268,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke."
7721,7722,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.1.269,SUFFOLK,"Not resolute, except so much were done,"
7722,7723,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.1.270,SUFFOLK,For things are often spoke and seldom meant:
7723,7724,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.1.271,SUFFOLK,"But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,"
7724,7725,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.1.272,SUFFOLK,"Seeing the deed is meritorious,"
7725,7726,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.1.273,SUFFOLK,"And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,"
7726,7727,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.1.274,SUFFOLK,"Say but the word, and I will be his priest."
7727,7728,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.1.275,CARDINAL,"But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,"
7728,7729,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.1.276,CARDINAL,Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
7729,7730,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.1.277,CARDINAL,"Say you consent and censure well the deed,"
7730,7731,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.1.278,CARDINAL,"And I'll provide his executioner,"
7731,7732,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.1.279,CARDINAL,I tender so the safety of my liege.
7732,7733,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.1.280,SUFFOLK,"Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing."
7733,7734,Henry VI Part 2,48.0,3.1.281,QUEEN MARGARET,And so say I.
7734,7735,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,3.1.282,YORK,"And I    and now we three have spoke it,"
7735,7736,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,3.1.283,YORK,It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
7736,7737,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,,YORK,Enter a Post
7737,7738,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.1.284,Post,"Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,"
7738,7739,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.1.285,Post,To signify that rebels there are up
7739,7740,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.1.286,Post,And put the Englishmen unto the sword:
7740,7741,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.1.287,Post,"Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,"
7741,7742,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.1.288,Post,"Before the wound do grow uncurable,"
7742,7743,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.1.289,Post,"For, being green, there is great hope of help."
7743,7744,Henry VI Part 2,51.0,3.1.290,CARDINAL,A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
7744,7745,Henry VI Part 2,51.0,3.1.291,CARDINAL,What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
7745,7746,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,3.1.292,YORK,That Somerset be sent as regent thither:
7746,7747,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,3.1.293,YORK,"'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,"
7747,7748,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,3.1.294,YORK,Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
7748,7749,Henry VI Part 2,53.0,3.1.295,SOMERSET,"If York, with all his far-fet policy,"
7749,7750,Henry VI Part 2,53.0,3.1.296,SOMERSET,"Had been the regent there instead of me,"
7750,7751,Henry VI Part 2,53.0,3.1.297,SOMERSET,He never would have stay'd in France so long.
7751,7752,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.1.298,YORK,"No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:"
7752,7753,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.1.299,YORK,I rather would have lost my life betimes
7753,7754,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.1.300,YORK,Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
7754,7755,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.1.301,YORK,By staying there so long till all were lost.
7755,7756,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.1.302,YORK,Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
7756,7757,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.1.303,YORK,Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.
7757,7758,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,3.1.304,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,"
7758,7759,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,3.1.305,QUEEN MARGARET,If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:
7759,7760,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,3.1.306,QUEEN MARGARET,"No more, good York, sweet Somerset, be still:"
7760,7761,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,3.1.307,QUEEN MARGARET,"Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,"
7761,7762,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,3.1.308,QUEEN MARGARET,Might happily have proved far worse than his.
7762,7763,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,3.1.309,YORK,"What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!"
7763,7764,Henry VI Part 2,57.0,3.1.310,SOMERSET,"And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!"
7764,7765,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.1.311,CARDINAL,"My Lord of York, try what your fortune is."
7765,7766,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.1.312,CARDINAL,The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
7766,7767,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.1.313,CARDINAL,And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:
7767,7768,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.1.314,CARDINAL,"To Ireland will you lead a band of men,"
7768,7769,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.1.315,CARDINAL,"Collected choicely, from each county some,"
7769,7770,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.1.316,CARDINAL,And try your hap against the Irishmen?
7770,7771,Henry VI Part 2,59.0,3.1.317,YORK,"I will, my lord, so please his majesty."
7771,7772,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.1.318,SUFFOLK,"Why, our authority is his consent,"
7772,7773,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.1.319,SUFFOLK,And what we do establish he confirms:
7773,7774,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.1.320,SUFFOLK,"Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand."
7774,7775,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,3.1.321,YORK,"I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,"
7775,7776,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,3.1.322,YORK,Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.
7776,7777,Henry VI Part 2,62.0,3.1.323,SUFFOLK,"A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd."
7777,7778,Henry VI Part 2,62.0,3.1.324,SUFFOLK,But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
7778,7779,Henry VI Part 2,63.0,3.1.325,CARDINAL,"No more of him, for I will deal with him"
7779,7780,Henry VI Part 2,63.0,3.1.326,CARDINAL,That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
7780,7781,Henry VI Part 2,63.0,3.1.327,CARDINAL,"And so break off, the day is almost spent:"
7781,7782,Henry VI Part 2,63.0,3.1.328,CARDINAL,"Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event."
7782,7783,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.1.329,YORK,"My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days"
7783,7784,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.1.330,YORK,"At Bristol I expect my soldiers,"
7784,7785,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.1.331,YORK,For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
7785,7786,Henry VI Part 2,65.0,3.1.332,SUFFOLK,"I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York."
7786,7787,Henry VI Part 2,65.0,,SUFFOLK,Exeunt all but YORK
7787,7788,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.333,YORK,"Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,"
7788,7789,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.334,YORK,And change misdoubt to resolution:
7789,7790,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.335,YORK,"Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art"
7790,7791,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.336,YORK,"Resign to death, it is not worth the enjoying:"
7791,7792,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.337,YORK,"Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,"
7792,7793,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.338,YORK,And find no harbour in a royal heart.
7793,7794,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.339,YORK,Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
7794,7795,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.340,YORK,"on thought,"
7795,7796,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.341,YORK,And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
7796,7797,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.342,YORK,My brain more busy than the labouring spider
7797,7798,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.343,YORK,Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
7798,7799,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.344,YORK,"Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,"
7799,7800,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.345,YORK,To send me packing with an host of men:

7807,7808,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.353,YORK,I will stir up in England some black storm

7817,7818,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.363,YORK,Under the title of John Mortimer.
7818,7819,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.364,YORK,In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
7819,7820,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.365,YORK,"Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,"
7820,7821,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.366,YORK,"And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts"

7822,7823,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.368,YORK,"And, in the end being rescued, I have seen"
7823,7824,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.369,YORK,"Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,"
7824,7825,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.370,YORK,Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
7825,7826,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.371,YORK,"Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,"
7826,7827,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.372,YORK,"Hath he conversed with the enemy,"
7827,7828,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.373,YORK,And undiscover'd come to me again
7828,7829,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.374,YORK,And given me notice of their villanies.
7829,7830,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.375,YORK,"This devil here shall be my substitute,"
7830,7831,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.376,YORK,"For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,"
7831,7832,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.377,YORK,"In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:"

7833,7834,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.379,YORK,How they affect the house and claim of York.
7834,7835,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.380,YORK,"Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,"
7835,7836,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.381,YORK,I know no pain they can inflict upon him
7836,7837,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.382,YORK,Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
7837,7838,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.383,YORK,"Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,"
7838,7839,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.384,YORK,"Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength"
7839,7840,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.385,YORK,"And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd,"
7840,7841,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.386,YORK,"For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,"
7841,7842,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.1.387,YORK,"And Henry put apart, the next for me."

7847,7848,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.2.3,Second Murderer,O that it were to do! What have we done?
7848,7849,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.2.4,Second Murderer,Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
7849,7850,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,,Second Murderer,Enter SUFFOLK
7850,7851,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.2.5,First Murder,Here comes my lord.

7852,7853,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.2.7,First Murderer,"Ay, my good lord, he's dead."
7853,7854,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,3.2.8,SUFFOLK,"Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house,"
7854,7855,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,3.2.9,SUFFOLK,I will reward you for this venturous deed.
7855,7856,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,3.2.10,SUFFOLK,The king and all the peers are here at hand.

7869,7870,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,3.2.21,KING HENRY VI,Than from true evidence of good esteem
7870,7871,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,3.2.22,KING HENRY VI,He be approved in practise culpable.
7871,7872,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,3.2.23,QUEEN MARGARET,"God forbid any malice should prevail,"
7872,7873,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,3.2.24,QUEEN MARGARET,That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
7873,7874,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,3.2.25,QUEEN MARGARET,Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
7874,7875,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.2.26,KING HENRY VI,"I thank thee, Meg, these words content me much."

7877,7878,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,3.2.28,KING HENRY VI,"Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?"
7878,7879,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,3.2.29,SUFFOLK,"Dead in his bed, my lord, Gloucester is dead."
7879,7880,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,3.2.30,QUEEN MARGARET,"Marry, God forfend!"
7880,7881,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.2.31,CARDINAL,God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night
7881,7882,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,3.2.32,CARDINAL,The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
7882,7883,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,,CARDINAL,KING HENRY VI swoons
7883,7884,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,3.2.33,QUEEN MARGARET,"How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead."
7884,7885,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,3.2.34,SOMERSET,"Rear up his body, wring him by the nose."
7885,7886,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,3.2.35,QUEEN MARGARET,"Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!"
7886,7887,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,3.2.36,SUFFOLK,"He doth revive again: madam, be patient."
7887,7888,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,3.2.37,KING HENRY VI,O heavenly God!
7888,7889,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,3.2.38,QUEEN MARGARET,How fares my gracious lord?
7889,7890,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,3.2.39,SUFFOLK,"Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!"
7890,7891,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.40,KING HENRY VI,"What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?"
7891,7892,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.41,KING HENRY VI,"Came he right now to sing a raven's note,"
7892,7893,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.42,KING HENRY VI,"Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers,"
7893,7894,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.43,KING HENRY VI,"And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,"
7894,7895,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.44,KING HENRY VI,"By crying comfort from a hollow breast,"
7895,7896,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.45,KING HENRY VI,Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
7896,7897,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.46,KING HENRY VI,"Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words,"
7897,7898,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.47,KING HENRY VI,"Lay not thy hands on me, forbear, I say,"
7898,7899,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.48,KING HENRY VI,Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
7899,7900,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.49,KING HENRY VI,"Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!"
7900,7901,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.50,KING HENRY VI,Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
7901,7902,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.51,KING HENRY VI,"Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world."
7902,7903,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.52,KING HENRY VI,"Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:"
7903,7904,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.53,KING HENRY VI,"Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,"
7904,7905,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.54,KING HENRY VI,"And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight,"
7905,7906,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.55,KING HENRY VI,"For in the shade of death I shall find joy,"
7906,7907,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,3.2.56,KING HENRY VI,"In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead."
7907,7908,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.57,QUEEN MARGARET,Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
7908,7909,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.58,QUEEN MARGARET,"Although the duke was enemy to him,"
7909,7910,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.59,QUEEN MARGARET,Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:
7910,7911,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.60,QUEEN MARGARET,"And for myself, foe as he was to me,"
7911,7912,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.61,QUEEN MARGARET,Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
7912,7913,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.62,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,"
7913,7914,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.63,QUEEN MARGARET,"I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,"
7914,7915,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.64,QUEEN MARGARET,"Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,"
7915,7916,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.65,QUEEN MARGARET,And all to have the noble duke alive.
7916,7917,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.66,QUEEN MARGARET,What know I how the world may deem of me?
7917,7918,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.67,QUEEN MARGARET,For it is known we were but hollow friends:
7918,7919,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.68,QUEEN MARGARET,"It may be judged I made the duke away,"
7919,7920,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.69,QUEEN MARGARET,"So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,"
7920,7921,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.70,QUEEN MARGARET,And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
7921,7922,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.71,QUEEN MARGARET,"This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!"
7922,7923,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,3.2.72,QUEEN MARGARET,"To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!"
7923,7924,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,3.2.73,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!"
7924,7925,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.74,QUEEN MARGARET,"Be woe for me, more wretched than he is."
7925,7926,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.75,QUEEN MARGARET,"What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?"
7926,7927,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"I am no loathsome leper, look on me."
7927,7928,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?"
7928,7929,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.78,QUEEN MARGARET,Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
7929,7930,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.79,QUEEN MARGARET,Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
7930,7931,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.80,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy."
7931,7932,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"Erect his statue and worship it,"
7932,7933,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.82,QUEEN MARGARET,And make my image but an alehouse sign.
7933,7934,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.83,QUEEN MARGARET,Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
7934,7935,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.84,QUEEN MARGARET,And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
7935,7936,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.85,QUEEN MARGARET,Drove back again unto my native clime?
7936,7937,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.86,QUEEN MARGARET,"What boded this, but well forewarning wind"
7937,7938,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.87,QUEEN MARGARET,"Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,"
7938,7939,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.88,QUEEN MARGARET,Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
7939,7940,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.89,QUEEN MARGARET,"What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts"
7940,7941,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.90,QUEEN MARGARET,And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:
7941,7942,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.91,QUEEN MARGARET,"And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,"
7942,7943,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.92,QUEEN MARGARET,Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
7943,7944,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.93,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,"
7944,7945,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.94,QUEEN MARGARET,But left that hateful office unto thee:
7945,7946,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.95,QUEEN MARGARET,"The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,"
7946,7947,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.96,QUEEN MARGARET,"Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,"
7947,7948,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.97,QUEEN MARGARET,"With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:"
7948,7949,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.98,QUEEN MARGARET,The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
7949,7950,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.99,QUEEN MARGARET,"And would not dash me with their ragged sides,"
7950,7951,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.100,QUEEN MARGARET,"Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,"
7951,7952,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.101,QUEEN MARGARET,Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
7952,7953,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.102,QUEEN MARGARET,"As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,"
7953,7954,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.103,QUEEN MARGARET,"When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,"
7954,7955,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.104,QUEEN MARGARET,"I stood upon the hatches in the storm,"
7955,7956,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.105,QUEEN MARGARET,And when the dusky sky began to rob
7956,7957,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.106,QUEEN MARGARET,"My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,"
7957,7958,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.107,QUEEN MARGARET,"I took a costly jewel from my neck,"
7958,7959,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.108,QUEEN MARGARET,"A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,"
7959,7960,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.109,QUEEN MARGARET,"And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,"
7960,7961,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.110,QUEEN MARGARET,And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
7961,7962,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.111,QUEEN MARGARET,And even with this I lost fair England's view
7962,7963,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.112,QUEEN MARGARET,And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
7963,7964,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.113,QUEEN MARGARET,"And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,"
7964,7965,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.114,QUEEN MARGARET,For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
7965,7966,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.115,QUEEN MARGARET,"How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,"
7966,7967,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.116,QUEEN MARGARET,"The agent of thy foul inconstancy,"
7967,7968,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.117,QUEEN MARGARET,"To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did"
7968,7969,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.118,QUEEN MARGARET,When he to madding Dido would unfold
7969,7970,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.119,QUEEN MARGARET,His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
7970,7971,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.120,QUEEN MARGARET,Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
7971,7972,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.121,QUEEN MARGARET,"Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!"
7972,7973,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,3.2.122,QUEEN MARGARET,For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
7973,7974,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,"Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons"
7974,7975,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.123,WARWICK,"It is reported, mighty sovereign,"
7975,7976,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.124,WARWICK,That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd
7976,7977,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.125,WARWICK,By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.
7977,7978,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.126,WARWICK,"The commons, like an angry hive of bees"
7978,7979,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.127,WARWICK,"That want their leader, scatter up and down"
7979,7980,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.128,WARWICK,And care not who they sting in his revenge.
7980,7981,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.129,WARWICK,"Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,"
7981,7982,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,3.2.130,WARWICK,Until they hear the order of his death.
7982,7983,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,3.2.131,KING HENRY VI,"That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true,"
7983,7984,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,3.2.132,KING HENRY VI,"But how he died God knows, not Henry:"
7984,7985,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,3.2.133,KING HENRY VI,"Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,"
7985,7986,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,3.2.134,KING HENRY VI,And comment then upon his sudden death.
7986,7987,Henry VI Part 2,30.0,3.2.135,WARWICK,"That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,"
7987,7988,Henry VI Part 2,30.0,3.2.136,WARWICK,With the rude multitude till I return.
7988,7989,Henry VI Part 2,30.0,,WARWICK,Exit
7989,7990,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.137,KING HENRY VI,"O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,"
7990,7991,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.138,KING HENRY VI,"My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul"
7991,7992,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.139,KING HENRY VI,Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
7992,7993,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.140,KING HENRY VI,"If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,"
7993,7994,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.141,KING HENRY VI,For judgment only doth belong to thee.
7994,7995,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.142,KING HENRY VI,Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
7995,7996,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.143,KING HENRY VI,"With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain"
7996,7997,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.144,KING HENRY VI,"Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,"
7997,7998,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.145,KING HENRY VI,"To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,"
7998,7999,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.146,KING HENRY VI,And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:
7999,8000,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.147,KING HENRY VI,"But all in vain are these mean obsequies,"
8000,8001,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.148,KING HENRY VI,"And to survey his dead and earthly image,"
8001,8002,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,3.2.149,KING HENRY VI,What were it but to make my sorrow greater?
8002,8003,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,,KING HENRY VI,"Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed"
8003,8004,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,3.2.150,WARWICK,"Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body."
8004,8005,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,3.2.151,KING HENRY VI,"That is to see how deep my grave is made,"
8005,8006,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,3.2.152,KING HENRY VI,"For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,"
8006,8007,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,3.2.153,KING HENRY VI,For seeing him I see my life in death.
8007,8008,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,3.2.154,WARWICK,As surely as my soul intends to live
8008,8009,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,3.2.155,WARWICK,With that dread King that took our state upon him
8009,8010,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,3.2.156,WARWICK,"To free us from his father's wrathful curse,"
8010,8011,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,3.2.157,WARWICK,I do believe that violent hands were laid
8011,8012,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,3.2.158,WARWICK,Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
8012,8013,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.2.159,SUFFOLK,"A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!"
8013,8014,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,3.2.160,SUFFOLK,What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
8014,8015,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.161,WARWICK,See how the blood is settled in his face.
8015,8016,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.162,WARWICK,"Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,"
8016,8017,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.163,WARWICK,"Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,"
8017,8018,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.164,WARWICK,"Being all descended to the labouring heart,"
8018,8019,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.165,WARWICK,"Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,"
8019,8020,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.166,WARWICK,"Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy,"
8020,8021,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.167,WARWICK,Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
8021,8022,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.168,WARWICK,To blush and beautify the cheek again.
8022,8023,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.169,WARWICK,"But see, his face is black and full of blood,"
8023,8024,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.170,WARWICK,"His eye-balls further out than when he lived,"
8024,8025,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.171,WARWICK,"Staring full ghastly like a strangled man,"
8025,8026,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.172,WARWICK,"His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling,"
8026,8027,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.173,WARWICK,"His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd"
8027,8028,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.174,WARWICK,And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:
8028,8029,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.175,WARWICK,"Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking,"
8029,8030,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.176,WARWICK,"His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,"
8030,8031,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.177,WARWICK,Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.
8031,8032,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.178,WARWICK,"It cannot be but he was murder'd here,"
8032,8033,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,3.2.179,WARWICK,The least of all these signs were probable.
8033,8034,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,3.2.180,SUFFOLK,"Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?"
8034,8035,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,3.2.181,SUFFOLK,"Myself and Beaufort had him in protection,"
8035,8036,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,3.2.182,SUFFOLK,"And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers."
8036,8037,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.2.183,WARWICK,"But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,"
8037,8038,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.2.184,WARWICK,"And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:"
8038,8039,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.2.185,WARWICK,"'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend,"
8039,8040,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,3.2.186,WARWICK,And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
8040,8041,Henry VI Part 2,39.0,3.2.187,QUEEN MARGARET,"Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen"
8041,8042,Henry VI Part 2,39.0,3.2.188,QUEEN MARGARET,As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
8042,8043,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.2.189,WARWICK,Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
8043,8044,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.2.190,WARWICK,"And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,"
8044,8045,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.2.191,WARWICK,But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?
8045,8046,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.2.192,WARWICK,"Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,"
8046,8047,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.2.193,WARWICK,"But may imagine how the bird was dead,"
8047,8048,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.2.194,WARWICK,Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
8048,8049,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,3.2.195,WARWICK,Even so suspicious is this tragedy.
8049,8050,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.2.196,QUEEN MARGARET,"Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?"
8050,8051,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,3.2.197,QUEEN MARGARET,Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?
8051,8052,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,3.2.198,SUFFOLK,"I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men,"
8052,8053,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,3.2.199,SUFFOLK,"But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,"
8053,8054,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,3.2.200,SUFFOLK,That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
8054,8055,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,3.2.201,SUFFOLK,That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
8055,8056,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,3.2.202,SUFFOLK,"Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,"
8056,8057,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,3.2.203,SUFFOLK,That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.
8057,8058,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,,SUFFOLK,"Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others"
8058,8059,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,3.2.204,WARWICK,"What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?"
8059,8060,Henry VI Part 2,44.0,3.2.205,QUEEN MARGARET,He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
8060,8061,Henry VI Part 2,44.0,3.2.206,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,"
8061,8062,Henry VI Part 2,44.0,3.2.207,QUEEN MARGARET,Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
8062,8063,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.2.208,WARWICK,"Madam, be still, with reverence may I say,"
8063,8064,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.2.209,WARWICK,For every word you speak in his behalf
8064,8065,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,3.2.210,WARWICK,Is slander to your royal dignity.
8065,8066,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.2.211,SUFFOLK,"Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!"
8066,8067,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.2.212,SUFFOLK,"If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,"
8067,8068,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.2.213,SUFFOLK,Thy mother took into her blameful bed
8068,8069,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.2.214,SUFFOLK,"Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock"
8069,8070,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.2.215,SUFFOLK,"Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art,"
8070,8071,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,3.2.216,SUFFOLK,And never of the Nevils' noble race.
8071,8072,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.217,WARWICK,But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
8072,8073,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.218,WARWICK,"And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,"
8073,8074,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.219,WARWICK,"Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,"
8074,8075,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.220,WARWICK,"And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,"
8075,8076,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.221,WARWICK,"I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee"
8076,8077,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.222,WARWICK,"Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,"
8077,8078,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.223,WARWICK,And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
8078,8079,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.224,WARWICK,"That thou thyself was born in bastardy,"
8079,8080,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.225,WARWICK,"And after all this fearful homage done,"
8080,8081,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.226,WARWICK,"Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,"
8081,8082,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,3.2.227,WARWICK,Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
8082,8083,Henry VI Part 2,48.0,3.2.228,SUFFOLK,"Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,"
8083,8084,Henry VI Part 2,48.0,3.2.229,SUFFOLK,If from this presence thou darest go with me.
8084,8085,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,3.2.230,WARWICK,"Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:"
8085,8086,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,3.2.231,WARWICK,"Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee"
8086,8087,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,3.2.232,WARWICK,And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
8087,8088,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,,WARWICK,Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
8088,8089,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.2.233,KING HENRY VI,What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
8089,8090,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.2.234,KING HENRY VI,"Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,"
8090,8091,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.2.235,KING HENRY VI,"And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel"
8091,8092,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,3.2.236,KING HENRY VI,Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
8092,8093,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,,KING HENRY VI,A noise within
8093,8094,Henry VI Part 2,51.0,3.2.237,QUEEN MARGARET,What noise is this?
8094,8095,Henry VI Part 2,51.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,"Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawn"
8095,8096,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,3.2.238,KING HENRY VI,"Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn"
8096,8097,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,3.2.239,KING HENRY VI,Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
8097,8098,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,3.2.240,KING HENRY VI,"Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?"
8098,8099,Henry VI Part 2,53.0,3.2.241,SUFFOLK,The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
8099,8100,Henry VI Part 2,53.0,3.2.242,SUFFOLK,"Set all upon me, mighty sovereign."
8100,8101,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.243,SALISBURY,"[To the Commons, entering]  Sirs, stand apart,"

8104,8105,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.247,SALISBURY,"Or banished fair England's territories,"
8105,8106,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.248,SALISBURY,They will by violence tear him from your palace
8106,8107,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.249,SALISBURY,And torture him with grievous lingering death.
8107,8108,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.250,SALISBURY,"They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died,"
8108,8109,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.251,SALISBURY,"They say, in him they fear your highness' death,"
8109,8110,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.252,SALISBURY,"And mere instinct of love and loyalty,"
8110,8111,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.253,SALISBURY,"Free from a stubborn opposite intent,"
8111,8112,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.254,SALISBURY,"As being thought to contradict your liking,"
8112,8113,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.255,SALISBURY,Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
8113,8114,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.256,SALISBURY,"They say, in care of your most royal person,"
8114,8115,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.257,SALISBURY,That if your highness should intend to sleep
8115,8116,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.258,SALISBURY,And charge that no man should disturb your rest
8116,8117,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.259,SALISBURY,"In pain of your dislike or pain of death,"
8117,8118,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.260,SALISBURY,"Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,"
8118,8119,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.261,SALISBURY,"Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,"
8119,8120,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.262,SALISBURY,"That slily glided towards your majesty,"
8120,8121,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.263,SALISBURY,"It were but necessary you were waked,"
8121,8122,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.264,SALISBURY,"Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,"
8122,8123,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.265,SALISBURY,"The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal,"
8123,8124,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.266,SALISBURY,"And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,"
8124,8125,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.267,SALISBURY,"That they will guard you, whether you will or no,"
8125,8126,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.268,SALISBURY,"From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,"
8126,8127,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.269,SALISBURY,"With whose envenomed and fatal sting,"
8127,8128,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.270,SALISBURY,"Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,"
8128,8129,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,3.2.271,SALISBURY,"They say, is shamefully bereft of life."
8129,8130,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,3.2.272,Commons,"[Within]  An answer from the king, my"

8132,8133,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,3.2.275,SUFFOLK,Could send such message to their sovereign:
8133,8134,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,3.2.276,SUFFOLK,"But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,"
8134,8135,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,3.2.277,SUFFOLK,To show how quaint an orator you are:
8135,8136,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,3.2.278,SUFFOLK,But all the honour Salisbury hath won
8136,8137,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,3.2.279,SUFFOLK,"Is, that he was the lord ambassador"
8137,8138,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,3.2.280,SUFFOLK,Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
8138,8139,Henry VI Part 2,57.0,3.2.281,Commons,"[Within]  An answer from the king, or we will all break in!"

8147,8148,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.2.290,KING HENRY VI,He shall not breathe infection in this air
8148,8149,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,3.2.291,KING HENRY VI,"But three days longer, on the pain of death."

8152,8153,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.294,KING HENRY VI,"No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,"
8153,8154,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.295,KING HENRY VI,Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
8154,8155,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.296,KING HENRY VI,"Had I but said, I would have kept my word,"
8155,8156,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.297,KING HENRY VI,"But when I swear, it is irrevocable."
8156,8157,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.298,KING HENRY VI,"If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found"
8157,8158,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.299,KING HENRY VI,"On any ground that I am ruler of,"
8158,8159,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.300,KING HENRY VI,The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
8159,8160,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.301,KING HENRY VI,"Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me,"
8160,8161,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,3.2.302,KING HENRY VI,I have great matters to impart to thee.
8161,8162,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,,KING HENRY VI,Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK
8162,8163,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,3.2.303,QUEEN MARGARET,Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
8163,8164,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,3.2.304,QUEEN MARGARET,Heart's discontent and sour affliction
8164,8165,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,3.2.305,QUEEN MARGARET,Be playfellows to keep you company!
8165,8166,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,3.2.306,QUEEN MARGARET,"There's two of you, the devil make a third!"
8166,8167,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,3.2.307,QUEEN MARGARET,And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
8167,8168,Henry VI Part 2,62.0,3.2.308,SUFFOLK,"Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,"
8168,8169,Henry VI Part 2,62.0,3.2.309,SUFFOLK,And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
8169,8170,Henry VI Part 2,63.0,3.2.310,QUEEN MARGARET,"Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!"
8170,8171,Henry VI Part 2,63.0,3.2.311,QUEEN MARGARET,Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
8171,8172,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.312,SUFFOLK,A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?
8172,8173,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.313,SUFFOLK,"Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,"
8173,8174,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.314,SUFFOLK,"I would invent as bitter-searching terms,"
8174,8175,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.315,SUFFOLK,"As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,"
8175,8176,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.316,SUFFOLK,"Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,"
8176,8177,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.317,SUFFOLK,"With full as many signs of deadly hate,"
8177,8178,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.318,SUFFOLK,As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
8178,8179,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.319,SUFFOLK,"My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,"
8179,8180,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.320,SUFFOLK,"Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint,"
8180,8181,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.321,SUFFOLK,"Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract,"
8181,8182,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.322,SUFFOLK,"Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:"
8182,8183,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.323,SUFFOLK,"And even now my burthen'd heart would break,"
8183,8184,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.324,SUFFOLK,Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
8184,8185,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.325,SUFFOLK,"Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!"
8185,8186,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.326,SUFFOLK,Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
8186,8187,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.327,SUFFOLK,Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
8187,8188,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.328,SUFFOLK,Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!
8188,8189,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.329,SUFFOLK,"Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,"
8189,8190,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.330,SUFFOLK,And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
8190,8191,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,3.2.331,SUFFOLK,All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--
8191,8192,Henry VI Part 2,65.0,3.2.332,QUEEN MARGARET,"Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment'st thyself,"
8192,8193,Henry VI Part 2,65.0,3.2.333,QUEEN MARGARET,"And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,"
8193,8194,Henry VI Part 2,65.0,3.2.334,QUEEN MARGARET,"Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,"
8194,8195,Henry VI Part 2,65.0,3.2.335,QUEEN MARGARET,And turn the force of them upon thyself.
8195,8196,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.2.336,SUFFOLK,"You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?"
8196,8197,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.2.337,SUFFOLK,"Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,"
8197,8198,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.2.338,SUFFOLK,"Well could I curse away a winter's night,"
8198,8199,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.2.339,SUFFOLK,"Though standing naked on a mountain top,"
8199,8200,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.2.340,SUFFOLK,"Where biting cold would never let grass grow,"
8200,8201,Henry VI Part 2,66.0,3.2.341,SUFFOLK,And think it but a minute spent in sport.
8201,8202,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.342,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,"
8202,8203,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.343,QUEEN MARGARET,"That I may dew it with my mournful tears,"
8203,8204,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.344,QUEEN MARGARET,"Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,"
8204,8205,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.345,QUEEN MARGARET,To wash away my woful monuments.
8205,8206,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.346,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,"
8206,8207,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.347,QUEEN MARGARET,"That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,"
8207,8208,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.348,QUEEN MARGARET,Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!
8208,8209,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.349,QUEEN MARGARET,"So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief,"
8209,8210,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.350,QUEEN MARGARET,"'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,"
8210,8211,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.351,QUEEN MARGARET,As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
8211,8212,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.352,QUEEN MARGARET,"I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,"
8212,8213,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.353,QUEEN MARGARET,Adventure to be banished myself:
8213,8214,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.354,QUEEN MARGARET,"And banished I am, if but from thee."
8214,8215,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.355,QUEEN MARGARET,"Go, speak not to me, even now be gone."
8215,8216,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.356,QUEEN MARGARET,"O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd"
8216,8217,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.357,QUEEN MARGARET,"Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,"
8217,8218,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.358,QUEEN MARGARET,Loather a hundred times to part than die.
8218,8219,Henry VI Part 2,67.0,3.2.359,QUEEN MARGARET,"Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee!"
8219,8220,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.360,SUFFOLK,"Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,"
8220,8221,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.361,SUFFOLK,"Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee."
8221,8222,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.362,SUFFOLK,"'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence,"
8222,8223,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.363,SUFFOLK,"A wilderness is populous enough,"
8223,8224,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.364,SUFFOLK,So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
8224,8225,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.365,SUFFOLK,"For where thou art, there is the world itself,"
8225,8226,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.366,SUFFOLK,"With every several pleasure in the world,"
8226,8227,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.367,SUFFOLK,"And where thou art not, desolation."
8227,8228,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.368,SUFFOLK,"I can no more: live thou to joy thy life,"
8228,8229,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,3.2.369,SUFFOLK,Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.
8229,8230,Henry VI Part 2,68.0,,SUFFOLK,Enter VAUX
8230,8231,Henry VI Part 2,69.0,3.2.370,QUEEN MARGARET,"Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?"
8231,8232,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.371,VAUX,To signify unto his majesty
8232,8233,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.372,VAUX,"That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death,"
8233,8234,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.373,VAUX,"For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,"
8234,8235,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.374,VAUX,"That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,"
8235,8236,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.375,VAUX,Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.
8236,8237,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.376,VAUX,Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
8237,8238,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.377,VAUX,"Were by his side, sometime he calls the king,"
8238,8239,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.378,VAUX,"And whispers to his pillow, as to him,"
8239,8240,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.379,VAUX,"The secrets of his overcharged soul,"
8240,8241,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.380,VAUX,And I am sent to tell his majesty
8241,8242,Henry VI Part 2,70.0,3.2.381,VAUX,That even now he cries aloud for him.
8242,8243,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.382,QUEEN MARGARET,Go tell this heavy message to the king.
8243,8244,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Exit VAUX
8244,8245,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.383,QUEEN MARGARET,Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
8245,8246,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.384,QUEEN MARGARET,"But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,"
8246,8247,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.385,QUEEN MARGARET,"Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?"
8247,8248,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.386,QUEEN MARGARET,"Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,"
8248,8249,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.387,QUEEN MARGARET,"And with the southern clouds contend in tears,"
8249,8250,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.388,QUEEN MARGARET,"Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?"
8250,8251,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.389,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming,"
8251,8252,Henry VI Part 2,71.0,3.2.390,QUEEN MARGARET,"If thou be found by me, thou art but dead."
8252,8253,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.391,SUFFOLK,"If I depart from thee, I cannot live,"
8253,8254,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.392,SUFFOLK,"And in thy sight to die, what were it else"
8254,8255,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.393,SUFFOLK,But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
8255,8256,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.394,SUFFOLK,"Here could I breathe my soul into the air,"
8256,8257,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.395,SUFFOLK,As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
8257,8258,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.396,SUFFOLK,Dying with mother's dug between its lips:
8258,8259,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.397,SUFFOLK,"Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,"
8259,8260,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.398,SUFFOLK,"And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,"
8260,8261,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.399,SUFFOLK,"To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth,"
8261,8262,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.400,SUFFOLK,"So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,"
8262,8263,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.401,SUFFOLK,"Or I should breathe it so into thy body,"
8263,8264,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.402,SUFFOLK,And then it lived in sweet Elysium.
8264,8265,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.403,SUFFOLK,"To die by thee were but to die in jest,"
8265,8266,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.404,SUFFOLK,From thee to die were torture more than death:
8266,8267,Henry VI Part 2,72.0,3.2.405,SUFFOLK,"O, let me stay, befall what may befall!"
8267,8268,Henry VI Part 2,73.0,3.2.406,QUEEN MARGARET,"Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,"
8268,8269,Henry VI Part 2,73.0,3.2.407,QUEEN MARGARET,It is applied to a deathful wound.
8269,8270,Henry VI Part 2,73.0,3.2.408,QUEEN MARGARET,"To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee,"
8270,8271,Henry VI Part 2,73.0,3.2.409,QUEEN MARGARET,"For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,"
8271,8272,Henry VI Part 2,73.0,3.2.410,QUEEN MARGARET,I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
8272,8273,Henry VI Part 2,74.0,3.2.411,SUFFOLK,I go.
8273,8274,Henry VI Part 2,75.0,3.2.412,QUEEN MARGARET,And take my heart with thee.
8274,8275,Henry VI Part 2,76.0,3.2.413,SUFFOLK,"A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask"
8275,8276,Henry VI Part 2,76.0,3.2.414,SUFFOLK,That ever did contain a thing of worth.
8276,8277,Henry VI Part 2,76.0,3.2.415,SUFFOLK,"Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we"
8277,8278,Henry VI Part 2,76.0,3.2.416,SUFFOLK,This way fall I to death.
8278,8279,Henry VI Part 2,77.0,3.2.417,QUEEN MARGARET,This way for me.

8284,8285,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.3.3,CARDINAL,"If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,"
8285,8286,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.3.4,CARDINAL,"Enough to purchase such another island,"
8286,8287,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,3.3.5,CARDINAL,"So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain."
8287,8288,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.3.6,KING HENRY VI,"Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,"
8288,8289,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,3.3.7,KING HENRY VI,Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
8289,8290,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,3.3.8,WARWICK,"Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee."
8290,8291,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.9,CARDINAL,Bring me unto my trial when you will.
8291,8292,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.10,CARDINAL,Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
8292,8293,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.11,CARDINAL,"Can I make men live, whether they will or no?"
8293,8294,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.12,CARDINAL,"O, torture me no more! I will confess."
8294,8295,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.13,CARDINAL,Alive again? then show me where he is:
8295,8296,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.14,CARDINAL,I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
8296,8297,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.15,CARDINAL,"He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them."
8297,8298,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.16,CARDINAL,"Comb down his hair, look, look! it stands upright,"
8298,8299,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.17,CARDINAL,Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
8299,8300,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.18,CARDINAL,"Give me some drink, and bid the apothecary"
8300,8301,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,3.3.19,CARDINAL,Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.

8305,8306,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,3.3.24,KING HENRY VI,And from his bosom purge this black despair!

8311,8312,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,3.3.30,KING HENRY VI,"He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!"
8312,8313,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,3.3.31,WARWICK,So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
8313,8314,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,3.3.32,KING HENRY VI,"Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all."
8314,8315,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,3.3.33,KING HENRY VI,"Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close,"

8322,8323,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,4.1.3,Captain,And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades

8326,8327,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,4.1.7,Captain,Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
8327,8328,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,4.1.8,Captain,"Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,"

8332,8333,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,4.1.13,Captain,"And thou that art his mate, make boot of this,"
8333,8334,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,4.1.14,Captain,"The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share."
8334,8335,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.1.15,First Gentleman,"What is my ransom, master? let me know."
8335,8336,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.1.16,Master,"A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head."
8336,8337,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.1.17,Master,"Master's-Mate	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours."
8337,8338,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.1.18,Captain,"What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,"
8338,8339,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.1.19,Captain,And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
8339,8340,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.1.20,Captain,"Cut both the villains' throats, for die you shall:"
8340,8341,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.1.21,Captain,The lives of those which we have lost in fight
8341,8342,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.1.22,Captain,Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!
8342,8343,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,4.1.23,First Gentleman,"I'll give it, sir, and therefore spare my life."
8343,8344,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.1.24,Second Gentleman,And so will I and write home for it straight.
8344,8345,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.1.25,WHITMORE,"I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,"
8345,8346,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.1.26,WHITMORE,"And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die,"
8346,8347,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,,WHITMORE,To SUFFOLK
8347,8348,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.1.27,WHITMORE,"And so should these, if I might have my will."
8348,8349,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,4.1.28,Captain,"Be not so rash, take ransom, let him live."
8349,8350,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,4.1.29,SUFFOLK,"Look on my George, I am a gentleman:"
8350,8351,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,4.1.30,SUFFOLK,"Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid."
8351,8352,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.1.31,WHITMORE,"And so am I, my name is Walter Whitmore."
8352,8353,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.1.32,WHITMORE,"How now! why start'st thou? what, doth"
8353,8354,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.1.33,WHITMORE,death affright?
8354,8355,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,4.1.34,SUFFOLK,"Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death."
8355,8356,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,4.1.35,SUFFOLK,A cunning man did calculate my birth
8356,8357,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,4.1.36,SUFFOLK,And told me that by water I should die:
8357,8358,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,4.1.37,SUFFOLK,"Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded,"
8358,8359,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,4.1.38,SUFFOLK,"Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded."
8359,8360,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,4.1.39,WHITMORE,"Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:"
8360,8361,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,4.1.40,WHITMORE,"Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,"
8361,8362,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,4.1.41,WHITMORE,"But with our sword we wiped away the blot,"
8362,8363,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,4.1.42,WHITMORE,"Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,"
8363,8364,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,4.1.43,WHITMORE,"Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,"
8364,8365,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,4.1.44,WHITMORE,And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!
8365,8366,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,4.1.45,SUFFOLK,"Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,"
8366,8367,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,4.1.46,SUFFOLK,"The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole."
8367,8368,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,4.1.47,WHITMORE,The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
8368,8369,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,4.1.48,SUFFOLK,"Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:"
8369,8370,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,4.1.49,SUFFOLK,"Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?"
8370,8371,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,4.1.50,Captain,"But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be."
8371,8372,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.51,SUFFOLK,"Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,"

8373,8374,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.53,SUFFOLK,Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
8374,8375,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.54,SUFFOLK,Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
8375,8376,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.55,SUFFOLK,Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
8376,8377,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.56,SUFFOLK,And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
8377,8378,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.57,SUFFOLK,"How often hast thou waited at my cup,"
8378,8379,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.58,SUFFOLK,"Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board."
8379,8380,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.59,SUFFOLK,When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
8380,8381,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.60,SUFFOLK,"Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,"
8381,8382,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.61,SUFFOLK,"Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride,"
8382,8383,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.62,SUFFOLK,How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
8383,8384,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.63,SUFFOLK,And duly waited for my coming forth?
8384,8385,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.64,SUFFOLK,"This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,"
8385,8386,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,4.1.65,SUFFOLK,And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
8386,8387,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,4.1.66,WHITMORE,"Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?"
8387,8388,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,4.1.67,Captain,"First let my words stab him, as he hath me."
8388,8389,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,4.1.68,SUFFOLK,"Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou."
8389,8390,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,4.1.69,Captain,Convey him hence and on our longboat's side
8390,8391,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,4.1.70,Captain,Strike off his head.
8391,8392,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,4.1.71,SUFFOLK,"Thou darest not, for thy own."
8392,8393,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,4.1.72,Captain,"Yes, Pole."

8397,8398,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.77,Captain,Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
8398,8399,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.78,Captain,For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
8399,8400,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.79,Captain,"Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground,"
8400,8401,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.80,Captain,"And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,"

8402,8403,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.82,Captain,Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
8403,8404,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.83,Captain,"And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,"
8404,8405,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.84,Captain,For daring to affy a mighty lord
8405,8406,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.85,Captain,"Unto the daughter of a worthless king,"
8406,8407,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.86,Captain,"Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem."

8408,8409,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.88,Captain,"And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged"
8409,8410,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.89,Captain,With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
8410,8411,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,4.1.90,Captain,"By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,"

8451,8452,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,4.1.131,SUFFOLK,And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
8452,8453,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,4.1.132,SUFFOLK,Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.

8486,8487,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,4.2.8,BEVIS,O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.
8487,8488,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.2.9,HOLLAND,The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
8488,8489,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.2.10,BEVIS,"Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen."

9069,9070,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,4.10.16,CADE,must serve me to feed on.

9071,9072,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.17,IDEN,"Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,"
9072,9073,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.18,IDEN,And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
9073,9074,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.19,IDEN,This small inheritance my father left me
9074,9075,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.20,IDEN,"Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy."
9075,9076,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.21,IDEN,"I seek not to wax great by others' waning,"
9076,9077,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.22,IDEN,"Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:"
9077,9078,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.23,IDEN,Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
9078,9079,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,4.10.24,IDEN,And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
9079,9080,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.10.25,CADE,Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a
9080,9081,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.10.26,CADE,"stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave."
9081,9082,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.10.27,CADE,"Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand"
9082,9083,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.10.28,CADE,crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but
9083,9084,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.10.29,CADE,"I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow"
9084,9085,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,4.10.30,CADE,"my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part."
9085,9086,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.10.31,IDEN,"Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,"
9086,9087,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.10.32,IDEN,"I know thee not, why, then, should I betray thee?"
9087,9088,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.10.33,IDEN,"Is't not enough to break into my garden,"
9088,9089,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.10.34,IDEN,"And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,"
9089,9090,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.10.35,IDEN,"Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,"
9090,9091,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,4.10.36,IDEN,But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?

9095,9096,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,4.10.41,CADE,"as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more."

9100,9101,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.46,IDEN,See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:
9101,9102,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.47,IDEN,"Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser,"
9102,9103,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.48,IDEN,"Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,"
9103,9104,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.49,IDEN,"Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon,"
9104,9105,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.50,IDEN,"My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast,"
9105,9106,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.51,IDEN,"And if mine arm be heaved in the air,"
9106,9107,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.52,IDEN,Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.
9107,9108,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.53,IDEN,"As for words, whose greatness answers words,"
9108,9109,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,4.10.54,IDEN,Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
9109,9110,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.10.55,CADE,"By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I"

9111,9112,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.10.57,CADE,the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou

9114,9115,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,,CADE,Here they fight. CADE falls
9115,9116,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.10.60,CADE,"O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:"
9116,9117,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.10.61,CADE,"let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me"
9117,9118,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.10.62,CADE,"but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them"

9120,9121,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,4.10.65,CADE,because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.
9121,9122,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,4.10.66,IDEN,"Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?"
9122,9123,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,4.10.67,IDEN,"Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,"
9123,9124,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,4.10.68,IDEN,And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:
9124,9125,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,4.10.69,IDEN,"Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,"
9125,9126,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,4.10.70,IDEN,"But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,"
9126,9127,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,4.10.71,IDEN,To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
9127,9128,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,4.10.72,CADE,"Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell"

9131,9132,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,,CADE,Dies
9132,9133,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.76,IDEN,"How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge."
9133,9134,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.77,IDEN,"Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee,"
9134,9135,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.78,IDEN,"And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,"
9135,9136,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.79,IDEN,"So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell."
9136,9137,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.80,IDEN,Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
9137,9138,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.81,IDEN,"Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,"
9138,9139,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.82,IDEN,"And there cut off thy most ungracious head,"
9139,9140,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.83,IDEN,"Which I will bear in triumph to the king,"
9140,9141,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,4.10.84,IDEN,Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

9143,9144,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,,IDEN,SCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.
9144,9145,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,,IDEN,"Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours"
9145,9146,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.1,YORK,"From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,"
9146,9147,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.2,YORK,And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
9147,9148,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.3,YORK,"Ring, bells, aloud, burn, bonfires, clear and bright,"
9148,9149,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.4,YORK,To entertain great England's lawful king.
9149,9150,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.5,YORK,"Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?"
9150,9151,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.6,YORK,"Let them obey that know not how to rule,"
9151,9152,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.7,YORK,This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
9152,9153,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.8,YORK,"I cannot give due action to my words,"
9153,9154,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.9,YORK,Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
9154,9155,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.10,YORK,"A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,"
9155,9156,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.11,YORK,On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.
9156,9157,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,,YORK,Enter BUCKINGHAM
9157,9158,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.12,YORK,"Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?"
9158,9159,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.1.13,YORK,"The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble."
9159,9160,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.1.14,BUCKINGHAM,"York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well."
9160,9161,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.1.15,YORK,"Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting."
9161,9162,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.1.16,YORK,"Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?"
9162,9163,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.1.17,BUCKINGHAM,"A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,"
9163,9164,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.1.18,BUCKINGHAM,"To know the reason of these arms in peace,"
9164,9165,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.1.19,BUCKINGHAM,"Or why thou, being a subject as I am,"
9165,9166,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.1.20,BUCKINGHAM,"Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,"
9166,9167,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.1.21,BUCKINGHAM,"Should raise so great a power without his leave,"
9167,9168,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.1.22,BUCKINGHAM,Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
9168,9169,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.23,YORK,"[Aside]  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:"
9169,9170,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.24,YORK,"O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,"
9170,9171,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.25,YORK,"I am so angry at these abject terms,"
9171,9172,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.26,YORK,"And now, like Ajax Telamonius,"
9172,9173,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.27,YORK,On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
9173,9174,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.28,YORK,"I am far better born than is the king,"
9174,9175,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.29,YORK,"More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:"
9175,9176,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.30,YORK,"But I must make fair weather yet a while,"
9176,9177,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.31,YORK,"Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--"
9177,9178,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.32,YORK,"Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,"
9178,9179,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.33,YORK,"That I have given no answer all this while,"
9179,9180,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.34,YORK,My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
9180,9181,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.35,YORK,The cause why I have brought this army hither
9181,9182,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.36,YORK,"Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,"
9182,9183,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.1.37,YORK,Seditious to his grace and to the state.
9183,9184,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,5.1.38,BUCKINGHAM,That is too much presumption on thy part:
9184,9185,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,5.1.39,BUCKINGHAM,"But if thy arms be to no other end,"
9185,9186,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,5.1.40,BUCKINGHAM,The king hath yielded unto thy demand:
9186,9187,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,5.1.41,BUCKINGHAM,The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
9187,9188,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,5.1.42,YORK,"Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?"
9188,9189,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,5.1.43,BUCKINGHAM,"Upon mine honour, he is prisoner."
9189,9190,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.44,YORK,"Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers."
9190,9191,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.45,YORK,"Soldiers, I thank you all, disperse yourselves,"
9191,9192,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.46,YORK,"Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,"
9192,9193,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.47,YORK,You shall have pay and every thing you wish.
9193,9194,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.48,YORK,"And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,"
9194,9195,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.49,YORK,"Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,"
9195,9196,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.50,YORK,"As pledges of my fealty and love,"
9196,9197,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.51,YORK,I'll send them all as willing as I live:
9197,9198,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.52,YORK,"Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,"
9198,9199,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.1.53,YORK,"Is his to use, so Somerset may die."
9199,9200,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,5.1.54,BUCKINGHAM,"York, I commend this kind submission:"
9200,9201,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,5.1.55,BUCKINGHAM,We twain will go into his highness' tent.
9201,9202,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,,BUCKINGHAM,Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants
9202,9203,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,5.1.56,KING HENRY VI,"Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,"
9203,9204,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,5.1.57,KING HENRY VI,That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?
9204,9205,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,5.1.58,YORK,In all submission and humility
9205,9206,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,5.1.59,YORK,York doth present himself unto your highness.
9206,9207,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,5.1.60,KING HENRY VI,Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
9207,9208,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.1.61,YORK,"To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,"
9208,9209,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.1.62,YORK,"And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,"
9209,9210,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.1.63,YORK,Who since I heard to be discomfited.
9210,9211,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,,YORK,"Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head"
9211,9212,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.1.64,IDEN,If one so rude and of so mean condition
9212,9213,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.1.65,IDEN,"May pass into the presence of a king,"
9213,9214,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.1.66,IDEN,"Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,"
9214,9215,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.1.67,IDEN,"The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew."
9215,9216,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,5.1.68,KING HENRY VI,"The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!"
9216,9217,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,5.1.69,KING HENRY VI,"O, let me view his visage, being dead,"
9217,9218,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,5.1.70,KING HENRY VI,That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
9218,9219,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,5.1.71,KING HENRY VI,"Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?"
9219,9220,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,5.1.72,IDEN,"I was, an't like your majesty."
9220,9221,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.1.73,KING HENRY VI,How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?
9221,9222,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.1.74,IDEN,"Alexander Iden, that's my name,"
9222,9223,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.1.75,IDEN,"A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king."
9223,9224,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,5.1.76,BUCKINGHAM,"So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss"
9224,9225,Henry VI Part 2,20.0,5.1.77,BUCKINGHAM,He were created knight for his good service.
9225,9226,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,5.1.78,KING HENRY VI,"Iden, kneel down."
9226,9227,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,,KING HENRY VI,He kneels
9227,9228,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,5.1.79,KING HENRY VI,Rise up a knight.
9228,9229,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,5.1.80,KING HENRY VI,"We give thee for reward a thousand marks,"
9229,9230,Henry VI Part 2,21.0,5.1.81,KING HENRY VI,And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
9230,9231,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,5.1.82,IDEN,May Iden live to merit such a bounty.
9231,9232,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,5.1.83,IDEN,And never live but true unto his liege!
9232,9233,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,,IDEN,Rises
9233,9234,Henry VI Part 2,22.0,,IDEN,Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET
9234,9235,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,5.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:"
9235,9236,Henry VI Part 2,23.0,5.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke."
9236,9237,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,5.1.86,QUEEN MARGARET,"For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,"
9237,9238,Henry VI Part 2,24.0,5.1.87,QUEEN MARGARET,But boldly stand and front him to his face.
9238,9239,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.88,YORK,How now! is Somerset at liberty?
9239,9240,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.89,YORK,"Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,"
9240,9241,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.90,YORK,And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
9241,9242,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.91,YORK,Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
9242,9243,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.92,YORK,"False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,"
9243,9244,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.93,YORK,Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
9244,9245,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.94,YORK,"King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,"
9245,9246,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.95,YORK,"Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,"
9246,9247,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.96,YORK,"Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor."
9247,9248,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.97,YORK,"That head of thine doth not become a crown,"
9248,9249,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.98,YORK,"Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,"
9249,9250,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.99,YORK,And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
9250,9251,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.100,YORK,"That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,"
9251,9252,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.101,YORK,"Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,"
9252,9253,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.102,YORK,Is able with the change to kill and cure.
9253,9254,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.103,YORK,Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
9254,9255,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.104,YORK,And with the same to act controlling laws.
9255,9256,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.105,YORK,"Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more"
9256,9257,Henry VI Part 2,25.0,5.1.106,YORK,O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.
9257,9258,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,5.1.107,SOMERSET,"O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,"
9258,9259,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,5.1.108,SOMERSET,"Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown,"
9259,9260,Henry VI Part 2,26.0,5.1.109,SOMERSET,"Obey, audacious traitor, kneel for grace."
9260,9261,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,5.1.110,YORK,"Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,"
9261,9262,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,5.1.111,YORK,If they can brook I bow a knee to man.
9262,9263,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,5.1.112,YORK,"Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail,"
9263,9264,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,,YORK,Exit Attendant
9264,9265,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,5.1.113,YORK,"I know, ere they will have me go to ward,"
9265,9266,Henry VI Part 2,27.0,5.1.114,YORK,They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.
9266,9267,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,5.1.115,QUEEN MARGARET,"Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,"
9267,9268,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,5.1.116,QUEEN MARGARET,To say if that the bastard boys of York
9268,9269,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,5.1.117,QUEEN MARGARET,Shall be the surety for their traitor father.
9269,9270,Henry VI Part 2,28.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Exit BUCKINGHAM
9270,9271,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,5.1.118,YORK,"O blood-besotted Neapolitan,"

9273,9274,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,5.1.121,YORK,"Shall be their father's bail, and bane to those"
9274,9275,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,5.1.122,YORK,That for my surety will refuse the boys!
9275,9276,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,,YORK,Enter EDWARD and RICHARD
9276,9277,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,5.1.123,YORK,See where they come: I'll warrant they'll
9277,9278,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,5.1.124,YORK,make it good.
9278,9279,Henry VI Part 2,29.0,,YORK,Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD
9279,9280,Henry VI Part 2,30.0,5.1.125,QUEEN MARGARET,And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
9280,9281,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,5.1.126,CLIFFORD,Health and all happiness to my lord the king!
9281,9282,Henry VI Part 2,31.0,,CLIFFORD,Kneels
9282,9283,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,5.1.127,YORK,"I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?"
9283,9284,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,5.1.128,YORK,"Nay, do not fright us with an angry look,"
9284,9285,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,5.1.129,YORK,"We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again,"
9285,9286,Henry VI Part 2,32.0,5.1.130,YORK,"For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee."
9286,9287,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,5.1.131,CLIFFORD,"This is my king, York, I do not mistake,"
9287,9288,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,5.1.132,CLIFFORD,But thou mistakest me much to think I do:
9288,9289,Henry VI Part 2,33.0,5.1.133,CLIFFORD,To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
9289,9290,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,5.1.134,KING HENRY VI,"Ay, Clifford, a bedlam and ambitious humour"
9290,9291,Henry VI Part 2,34.0,5.1.135,KING HENRY VI,Makes him oppose himself against his king.
9291,9292,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,5.1.136,CLIFFORD,"He is a traitor, let him to the Tower,"
9292,9293,Henry VI Part 2,35.0,5.1.137,CLIFFORD,And chop away that factious pate of his.
9293,9294,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,5.1.138,QUEEN MARGARET,"He is arrested, but will not obey,"
9294,9295,Henry VI Part 2,36.0,5.1.139,QUEEN MARGARET,"His sons, he says, shall give their words for him."
9295,9296,Henry VI Part 2,37.0,5.1.140,YORK,"Will you not, sons?"
9296,9297,Henry VI Part 2,38.0,5.1.141,EDWARD,"Ay, noble father, if our words will serve."
9297,9298,Henry VI Part 2,39.0,5.1.142,RICHARD,"And if words will not, then our weapons shall."
9298,9299,Henry VI Part 2,40.0,5.1.143,CLIFFORD,"Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!"
9299,9300,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,5.1.144,YORK,"Look in a glass, and call thy image so:"
9300,9301,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,5.1.145,YORK,"I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor."
9301,9302,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,5.1.146,YORK,"Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,"
9302,9303,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,5.1.147,YORK,That with the very shaking of their chains
9303,9304,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,5.1.148,YORK,They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
9304,9305,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,5.1.149,YORK,Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
9305,9306,Henry VI Part 2,41.0,,YORK,Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY
9306,9307,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,5.1.150,CLIFFORD,Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.
9307,9308,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,5.1.151,CLIFFORD,"And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,"
9308,9309,Henry VI Part 2,42.0,5.1.152,CLIFFORD,If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.
9309,9310,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,5.1.153,RICHARD,Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
9310,9311,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,5.1.154,RICHARD,"Run back and bite, because he was withheld,"
9311,9312,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,5.1.155,RICHARD,"Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,"
9312,9313,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,5.1.156,RICHARD,Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:
9313,9314,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,5.1.157,RICHARD,"And such a piece of service will you do,"
9314,9315,Henry VI Part 2,43.0,5.1.158,RICHARD,If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
9315,9316,Henry VI Part 2,44.0,5.1.159,CLIFFORD,"Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,"
9316,9317,Henry VI Part 2,44.0,5.1.160,CLIFFORD,As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!
9317,9318,Henry VI Part 2,45.0,5.1.161,YORK,"Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon."
9318,9319,Henry VI Part 2,46.0,5.1.162,CLIFFORD,"Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves."
9319,9320,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.163,KING HENRY VI,"Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?"
9320,9321,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.164,KING HENRY VI,"Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,"
9321,9322,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.165,KING HENRY VI,Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!
9322,9323,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.166,KING HENRY VI,"What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,"
9323,9324,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.167,KING HENRY VI,And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
9324,9325,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.168,KING HENRY VI,"O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?"
9325,9326,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.169,KING HENRY VI,"If it be banish'd from the frosty head,"
9326,9327,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.170,KING HENRY VI,Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?
9327,9328,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.171,KING HENRY VI,"Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,"
9328,9329,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.172,KING HENRY VI,And shame thine honourable age with blood?
9329,9330,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.173,KING HENRY VI,"Why art thou old, and want'st experience?"
9330,9331,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.174,KING HENRY VI,"Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?"
9331,9332,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.175,KING HENRY VI,For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me
9332,9333,Henry VI Part 2,47.0,5.1.176,KING HENRY VI,That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
9333,9334,Henry VI Part 2,48.0,5.1.177,SALISBURY,"My lord, I have consider'd with myself"
9334,9335,Henry VI Part 2,48.0,5.1.178,SALISBURY,"The title of this most renowned duke,"
9335,9336,Henry VI Part 2,48.0,5.1.179,SALISBURY,And in my conscience do repute his grace
9336,9337,Henry VI Part 2,48.0,5.1.180,SALISBURY,The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
9337,9338,Henry VI Part 2,49.0,5.1.181,KING HENRY VI,Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
9338,9339,Henry VI Part 2,50.0,5.1.182,SALISBURY,I have.
9339,9340,Henry VI Part 2,51.0,5.1.183,KING HENRY VI,Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
9340,9341,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.184,SALISBURY,"It is great sin to swear unto a sin,"
9341,9342,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.185,SALISBURY,But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
9342,9343,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.186,SALISBURY,Who can be bound by any solemn vow
9343,9344,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.187,SALISBURY,"To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,"
9344,9345,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.188,SALISBURY,"To force a spotless virgin's chastity,"
9345,9346,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.189,SALISBURY,"To reave the orphan of his patrimony,"
9346,9347,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.190,SALISBURY,"To wring the widow from her custom'd right,"
9347,9348,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.191,SALISBURY,And have no other reason for this wrong
9348,9349,Henry VI Part 2,52.0,5.1.192,SALISBURY,But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
9349,9350,Henry VI Part 2,53.0,5.1.193,QUEEN MARGARET,A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
9350,9351,Henry VI Part 2,54.0,5.1.194,KING HENRY VI,"Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself."
9351,9352,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,5.1.195,YORK,"Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,"
9352,9353,Henry VI Part 2,55.0,5.1.196,YORK,I am resolved for death or dignity.
9353,9354,Henry VI Part 2,56.0,5.1.197,CLIFFORD,"The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true."
9354,9355,Henry VI Part 2,57.0,5.1.198,WARWICK,"You were best to go to bed and dream again,"
9355,9356,Henry VI Part 2,57.0,5.1.199,WARWICK,To keep thee from the tempest of the field.
9356,9357,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,5.1.200,CLIFFORD,I am resolved to bear a greater storm
9357,9358,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,5.1.201,CLIFFORD,"Than any thou canst conjure up to-day,"
9358,9359,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,5.1.202,CLIFFORD,"And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,"
9359,9360,Henry VI Part 2,58.0,5.1.203,CLIFFORD,Might I but know thee by thy household badge.
9360,9361,Henry VI Part 2,59.0,5.1.204,WARWICK,"Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,"
9361,9362,Henry VI Part 2,59.0,5.1.205,WARWICK,"The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,"
9362,9363,Henry VI Part 2,59.0,5.1.206,WARWICK,"This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,"
9363,9364,Henry VI Part 2,59.0,5.1.207,WARWICK,As on a mountain top the cedar shows
9364,9365,Henry VI Part 2,59.0,5.1.208,WARWICK,"That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,"
9365,9366,Henry VI Part 2,59.0,5.1.209,WARWICK,Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
9366,9367,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,5.1.210,CLIFFORD,And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
9367,9368,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,5.1.211,CLIFFORD,"And tread it under foot with all contempt,"
9368,9369,Henry VI Part 2,60.0,5.1.212,CLIFFORD,Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.
9369,9370,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,5.1.213,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"And so to arms, victorious father,"
9370,9371,Henry VI Part 2,61.0,5.1.214,YOUNG CLIFFORD,To quell the rebels and their complices.
9371,9372,Henry VI Part 2,62.0,5.1.215,RICHARD,"Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,"
9372,9373,Henry VI Part 2,62.0,5.1.216,RICHARD,For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.
9373,9374,Henry VI Part 2,63.0,5.1.217,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell."
9374,9375,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,5.1.218,RICHARD,"If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell."
9375,9376,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,,RICHARD,Exeunt severally
9376,9377,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,,RICHARD,SCENE II. Saint Alban's.
9377,9378,Henry VI Part 2,64.0,,RICHARD,Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK
9378,9379,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.1,WARWICK,"Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:"
9379,9380,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.2,WARWICK,"And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,"
9380,9381,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.3,WARWICK,"Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum"
9381,9382,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.4,WARWICK,"And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,"
9382,9383,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.5,WARWICK,"Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:"
9383,9384,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.6,WARWICK,"Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,"
9384,9385,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.7,WARWICK,Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
9385,9386,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,,WARWICK,Enter YORK
9386,9387,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.2.8,WARWICK,"How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?"
9387,9388,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.2.9,YORK,"The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,"
9388,9389,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.2.10,YORK,But match to match I have encounter'd him
9389,9390,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.2.11,YORK,And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
9390,9391,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.2.12,YORK,Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.
9391,9392,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,,YORK,Enter CLIFFORD
9392,9393,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.2.13,WARWICK,Of one or both of us the time is come.
9393,9394,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.2.14,YORK,"Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,"
9394,9395,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.2.15,YORK,For I myself must hunt this deer to death.
9395,9396,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.2.16,WARWICK,"Then, nobly, York, 'tis for a crown thou fight'st."
9396,9397,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.2.17,WARWICK,"As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,"
9397,9398,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.2.18,WARWICK,It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.
9398,9399,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,,WARWICK,Exit
9399,9400,Henry VI Part 2,6.0,5.2.19,CLIFFORD,"What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?"
9400,9401,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,5.2.20,YORK,"With thy brave bearing should I be in love,"
9401,9402,Henry VI Part 2,7.0,5.2.21,YORK,But that thou art so fast mine enemy.
9402,9403,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,5.2.22,CLIFFORD,"Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,"
9403,9404,Henry VI Part 2,8.0,5.2.23,CLIFFORD,But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.
9404,9405,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.2.24,YORK,So let it help me now against thy sword
9405,9406,Henry VI Part 2,9.0,5.2.25,YORK,As I in justice and true right express it.
9406,9407,Henry VI Part 2,10.0,5.2.26,CLIFFORD,My soul and body on the action both!
9407,9408,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,5.2.27,YORK,A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
9408,9409,Henry VI Part 2,11.0,,YORK,"They fight, and CLIFFORD falls"
9409,9410,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,5.2.28,CLIFFORD,La fin couronne les oeuvres.
9410,9411,Henry VI Part 2,12.0,,CLIFFORD,Dies

9412,9413,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,5.2.30,YORK,"Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!"
9413,9414,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,,YORK,Exit
9414,9415,Henry VI Part 2,13.0,,YORK,Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
9415,9416,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.31,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Shame and confusion! all is on the rout,"
9416,9417,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.32,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds"
9417,9418,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.33,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,"
9418,9419,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.34,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Whom angry heavens do make their minister
9419,9420,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.35,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
9420,9421,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.36,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
9421,9422,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.37,YOUNG CLIFFORD,He that is truly dedicate to war
9422,9423,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.38,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself"
9423,9424,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.39,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Hath not essentially but by circumstance
9424,9425,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.40,YOUNG CLIFFORD,The name of valour.
9425,9426,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Seeing his dead father
9426,9427,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.41,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"O, let the vile world end,"
9427,9428,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.42,YOUNG CLIFFORD,And the premised flames of the last day
9428,9429,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.43,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Knit earth and heaven together!
9429,9430,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.44,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,"
9430,9431,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.45,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Particularities and petty sounds
9431,9432,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.46,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,"
9432,9433,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.47,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve"
9433,9434,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.48,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"The silver livery of advised age,"
9434,9435,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.49,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus"
9435,9436,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.50,YOUNG CLIFFORD,To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
9436,9437,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.51,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,"
9437,9438,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.52,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"It shall be stony. York not our old men spares,"
9438,9439,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.53,YOUNG CLIFFORD,No more will I their babes: tears virginal
9439,9440,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.54,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,"
9440,9441,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.55,YOUNG CLIFFORD,And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
9441,9442,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.56,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
9442,9443,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.57,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
9443,9444,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.58,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Meet I an infant of the house of York,"
9444,9445,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.59,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Into as many gobbets will I cut it
9445,9446,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.60,YOUNG CLIFFORD,As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:
9446,9447,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.61,YOUNG CLIFFORD,In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
9447,9448,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.62,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:"
9448,9449,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.63,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"As did AEneas old Anchises bear,"
9449,9450,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.64,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders,"
9450,9451,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.65,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"But then AEneas bare a living load,"
9451,9452,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,5.2.66,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.
9452,9453,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Exit, bearing off his father"
9453,9454,Henry VI Part 2,14.0,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET is killed
9454,9455,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.2.67,RICHARD,"So, lie thou there,"
9455,9456,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.2.68,RICHARD,"For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,"
9456,9457,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.2.69,RICHARD,"The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset"
9457,9458,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.2.70,RICHARD,Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
9458,9459,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.2.71,RICHARD,"Sword, hold thy temper, heart, be wrathful still:"
9459,9460,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,5.2.72,RICHARD,"Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill."
9460,9461,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,,RICHARD,Exit
9461,9462,Henry VI Part 2,15.0,,RICHARD,"Fight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and others"
9462,9463,Henry VI Part 2,16.0,5.2.73,QUEEN MARGARET,"Away, my lord! you are slow, for shame, away!"
9463,9464,Henry VI Part 2,17.0,5.2.74,KING HENRY VI,"Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay."
9464,9465,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.75,QUEEN MARGARET,What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:
9465,9466,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.76,QUEEN MARGARET,"Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,"
9466,9467,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.77,QUEEN MARGARET,"To give the enemy way, and to secure us"
9467,9468,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.78,QUEEN MARGARET,"By what we can, which can no more but fly."
9468,9469,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Alarum afar off
9469,9470,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.79,QUEEN MARGARET,"If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom"
9470,9471,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.80,QUEEN MARGARET,"Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,"
9471,9472,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.81,QUEEN MARGARET,"As well we may, if not through your neglect,"
9472,9473,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.82,QUEEN MARGARET,"We shall to London get, where you are loved"
9473,9474,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.83,QUEEN MARGARET,And where this breach now in our fortunes made
9474,9475,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,5.2.84,QUEEN MARGARET,May readily be stopp'd.
9475,9476,Henry VI Part 2,18.0,,QUEEN MARGARET,Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
9476,9477,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.2.85,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"But that my heart's on future mischief set,"
9477,9478,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.2.86,YOUNG CLIFFORD,I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:
9478,9479,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.2.87,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"But fly you must, uncurable discomfit"
9479,9480,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.2.88,YOUNG CLIFFORD,Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
9480,9481,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.2.89,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Away, for your relief! and we will live"
9481,9482,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.2.90,YOUNG CLIFFORD,To see their day and them our fortune give:
9482,9483,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,5.2.91,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Away, my lord, away!"

9485,9486,Henry VI Part 2,19.0,,YOUNG CLIFFORD,"Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours"
9486,9487,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.3.1,YORK,"Of Salisbury, who can report of him,"
9487,9488,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.3.2,YORK,"That winter lion, who in rage forgets"
9488,9489,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.3.3,YORK,"Aged contusions and all brush of time,"
9489,9490,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.3.4,YORK,"And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,"
9490,9491,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.3.5,YORK,Repairs him with occasion? This happy day
9491,9492,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.3.6,YORK,"Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,"
9492,9493,Henry VI Part 2,1.0,5.3.7,YORK,If Salisbury be lost.
9493,9494,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.8,RICHARD,"My noble father,"
9494,9495,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.9,RICHARD,"Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,"
9495,9496,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.10,RICHARD,"Three times bestrid him, thrice I led him off,"
9496,9497,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.11,RICHARD,Persuaded him from any further act:
9497,9498,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.12,RICHARD,"But still, where danger was, still there I met him,"
9498,9499,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.13,RICHARD,"And like rich hangings in a homely house,"
9499,9500,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.14,RICHARD,So was his will in his old feeble body.
9500,9501,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,5.3.15,RICHARD,"But, noble as he is, look where he comes."
9501,9502,Henry VI Part 2,2.0,,RICHARD,Enter SALISBURY
9502,9503,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.16,SALISBURY,"Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day,"
9503,9504,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.17,SALISBURY,"By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:"
9504,9505,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.18,SALISBURY,"God knows how long it is I have to live,"
9505,9506,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.19,SALISBURY,And it hath pleased him that three times to-day
9506,9507,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.20,SALISBURY,You have defended me from imminent death.
9507,9508,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.21,SALISBURY,"Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:"
9508,9509,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.22,SALISBURY,"'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,"
9509,9510,Henry VI Part 2,3.0,5.3.23,SALISBURY,Being opposites of such repairing nature.
9510,9511,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.3.24,YORK,"I know our safety is to follow them,"
9511,9512,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.3.25,YORK,"For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,"
9512,9513,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.3.26,YORK,To call a present court of parliament.
9513,9514,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.3.27,YORK,Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
9514,9515,Henry VI Part 2,4.0,5.3.28,YORK,What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
9515,9516,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.3.29,WARWICK,"After them! nay, before them, if we can."
9516,9517,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.3.30,WARWICK,"Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:"
9517,9518,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.3.31,WARWICK,Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
9518,9519,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.3.32,WARWICK,Shall be eternized in all age to come.
9519,9520,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.3.33,WARWICK,"Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:"
9520,9521,Henry VI Part 2,5.0,5.3.34,WARWICK,And more such days as these to us befall!

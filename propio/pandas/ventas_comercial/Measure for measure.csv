58372,58373,Measure for measure,3.0,1.1.5,DUKE VINCENTIO,Since I am put to know that your own science

58399,58400,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.30,DUKE VINCENTIO,That to the observer doth thy history
58400,58401,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.31,DUKE VINCENTIO,Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
58401,58402,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.32,DUKE VINCENTIO,Are not thine own so proper as to waste
58402,58403,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.33,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee."
58403,58404,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.34,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,"

58406,58407,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.37,DUKE VINCENTIO,As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd

58408,58409,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.39,DUKE VINCENTIO,The smallest scruple of her excellence

58411,58412,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.42,DUKE VINCENTIO,Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
58412,58413,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.43,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To one that can my part in him advertise,"
58413,58414,Measure for measure,7.0,1.1.44,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Hold therefore, Angelo:--"

58420,58421,Measure for measure,8.0,1.1.51,ANGELO,"Let there be some more test made of my metal,"

58426,58427,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.57,DUKE VINCENTIO,Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
58427,58428,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.58,DUKE VINCENTIO,That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
58428,58429,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.59,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,"
58429,58430,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.60,DUKE VINCENTIO,"As time and our concernings shall importune,"
58430,58431,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.61,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How it goes with us, and do look to know"
58431,58432,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.62,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What doth befall you here. So, fare you well,"
58432,58433,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.63,DUKE VINCENTIO,To the hopeful execution do I leave you
58433,58434,Measure for measure,9.0,1.1.64,DUKE VINCENTIO,Of your commissions.
58434,58435,Measure for measure,10.0,1.1.65,ANGELO,"Yet give leave, my lord,"
58435,58436,Measure for measure,10.0,1.1.66,ANGELO,That we may bring you something on the way.
58436,58437,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.67,DUKE VINCENTIO,"My haste may not admit it,"
58437,58438,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.68,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do"
58438,58439,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.69,DUKE VINCENTIO,"With any scruple, your scope is as mine own"
58439,58440,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.70,DUKE VINCENTIO,So to enforce or qualify the laws
58440,58441,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.71,DUKE VINCENTIO,As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
58441,58442,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.72,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I'll privily away. I love the people,"
58442,58443,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.73,DUKE VINCENTIO,But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
58443,58444,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.74,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Through it do well, I do not relish well"
58444,58445,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.75,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Their loud applause and Aves vehement,"
58445,58446,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.76,DUKE VINCENTIO,Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
58446,58447,Measure for measure,11.0,1.1.77,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That does affect it. Once more, fare you well."
58447,58448,Measure for measure,12.0,1.1.78,ANGELO,The heavens give safety to your purposes!
58448,58449,Measure for measure,13.0,1.1.79,ESCALUS,Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
58449,58450,Measure for measure,14.0,1.1.80,DUKE,I thank you. Fare you well.

58452,58453,Measure for measure,15.0,1.1.82,ESCALUS,"To have free speech with you, and it concerns me"
58453,58454,Measure for measure,15.0,1.1.83,ESCALUS,To look into the bottom of my place:
58454,58455,Measure for measure,15.0,1.1.84,ESCALUS,"A power I have, but of what strength and nature"
58455,58456,Measure for measure,15.0,1.1.85,ESCALUS,I am not yet instructed.
58456,58457,Measure for measure,16.0,1.1.86,ANGELO,"'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,"
58457,58458,Measure for measure,16.0,1.1.87,ANGELO,And we may soon our satisfaction have
58458,58459,Measure for measure,16.0,1.1.88,ANGELO,Touching that point.
58459,58460,Measure for measure,17.0,1.1.89,ESCALUS,I'll wait upon your honour.

58465,58466,Measure for measure,1.0,1.2.3,LUCIO,the dukes fall upon the king.
58466,58467,Measure for measure,2.0,1.2.4,First Gentleman,"Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of"

58475,58476,Measure for measure,7.0,1.2.13,First Gentleman,all the rest from their functions: they put forth
58476,58477,Measure for measure,7.0,1.2.14,First Gentleman,"to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in"
58477,58478,Measure for measure,7.0,1.2.15,First Gentleman,"the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition"
58478,58479,Measure for measure,7.0,1.2.16,First Gentleman,well that prays for peace.

58482,58483,Measure for measure,10.0,1.2.20,Second Gentleman,No? a dozen times at least.

58489,58490,Measure for measure,15.0,1.2.27,First Gentleman,"Well, there went but a pair of shears between us."

58529,58530,Measure for measure,37.0,1.2.66,LUCIO,"Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two"

58534,58535,Measure for measure,39.0,1.2.71,First Gentleman,"But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation."

58552,58553,Measure for measure,51.0,1.2.87,MISTRESS OVERDONE,And what shall become of those in the city?

58559,58560,Measure for measure,55.0,1.2.94,MISTRESS OVERDONE,What shall become of me?
58560,58561,Measure for measure,56.0,1.2.95,POMPEY,"Come, fear you not: good counsellors lack no"

58572,58573,Measure for measure,59.0,1.2.105,CLAUDIO,"Bear me to prison, where I am committed."
58573,58574,Measure for measure,60.0,1.2.106,Provost,"I do it not in evil disposition,"
58574,58575,Measure for measure,60.0,1.2.107,Provost,But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
58575,58576,Measure for measure,61.0,1.2.108,CLAUDIO,Thus can the demigod Authority
58576,58577,Measure for measure,61.0,1.2.109,CLAUDIO,Make us pay down for our offence by weight

58581,58582,Measure for measure,63.0,1.2.113,CLAUDIO,"From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:"
58582,58583,Measure for measure,63.0,1.2.114,CLAUDIO,"As surfeit is the father of much fast,"
58583,58584,Measure for measure,63.0,1.2.115,CLAUDIO,So every scope by the immoderate use
58584,58585,Measure for measure,63.0,1.2.116,CLAUDIO,"Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,"
58585,58586,Measure for measure,63.0,1.2.117,CLAUDIO,"Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,"
58586,58587,Measure for measure,63.0,1.2.118,CLAUDIO,"A thirsty evil, and when we drink we die."

58590,58591,Measure for measure,64.0,1.2.122,LUCIO,as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy

58592,58593,Measure for measure,65.0,1.2.124,CLAUDIO,What but to speak of would offend again.
58593,58594,Measure for measure,66.0,1.2.125,LUCIO,"What, is't murder?"
58594,58595,Measure for measure,67.0,1.2.126,CLAUDIO,No.
58595,58596,Measure for measure,68.0,1.2.127,LUCIO,Lechery?
58596,58597,Measure for measure,69.0,1.2.128,CLAUDIO,Call it so.
58597,58598,Measure for measure,70.0,1.2.129,Provost,"Away, sir! you must go."
58598,58599,Measure for measure,71.0,1.2.130,CLAUDIO,"One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you."
58599,58600,Measure for measure,72.0,1.2.131,LUCIO,"A hundred, if they'll do you any good."
58600,58601,Measure for measure,72.0,1.2.132,LUCIO,Is lechery so look'd after?
58601,58602,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.133,CLAUDIO,Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
58602,58603,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.134,CLAUDIO,I got possession of Julietta's bed:
58603,58604,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.135,CLAUDIO,"You know the lady, she is fast my wife,"
58604,58605,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.136,CLAUDIO,Save that we do the denunciation lack
58605,58606,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.137,CLAUDIO,"Of outward order: this we came not to,"
58606,58607,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.138,CLAUDIO,Only for propagation of a dower
58607,58608,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.139,CLAUDIO,"Remaining in the coffer of her friends,"
58608,58609,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.140,CLAUDIO,From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
58609,58610,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.141,CLAUDIO,Till time had made them for us. But it chances
58610,58611,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.142,CLAUDIO,The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
58611,58612,Measure for measure,73.0,1.2.143,CLAUDIO,With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
58612,58613,Measure for measure,74.0,1.2.144,LUCIO,"With child, perhaps?"
58613,58614,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.145,CLAUDIO,"Unhappily, even so."
58614,58615,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.146,CLAUDIO,And the new deputy now for the duke--
58615,58616,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.147,CLAUDIO,"Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,"
58616,58617,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.148,CLAUDIO,Or whether that the body public be

58621,58622,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.153,CLAUDIO,"Or in his emmence that fills it up,"
58622,58623,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.154,CLAUDIO,I stagger in:--but this new governor
58623,58624,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.155,CLAUDIO,Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
58624,58625,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.156,CLAUDIO,"Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall"
58625,58626,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.157,CLAUDIO,So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
58626,58627,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.158,CLAUDIO,"And none of them been worn, and, for a name,"
58627,58628,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.159,CLAUDIO,Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
58628,58629,Measure for measure,75.0,1.2.160,CLAUDIO,Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
58629,58630,Measure for measure,76.0,1.2.161,LUCIO,I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
58630,58631,Measure for measure,76.0,1.2.162,LUCIO,"thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,"
58631,58632,Measure for measure,76.0,1.2.163,LUCIO,may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
58632,58633,Measure for measure,76.0,1.2.164,LUCIO,him.
58633,58634,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.165,CLAUDIO,"I have done so, but he's not to be found."
58634,58635,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.166,CLAUDIO,"I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:"
58635,58636,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.167,CLAUDIO,This day my sister should the cloister enter
58636,58637,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.168,CLAUDIO,And there receive her approbation:
58637,58638,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.169,CLAUDIO,Acquaint her with the danger of my state:

58640,58641,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.172,CLAUDIO,"I have great hope in that, for in her youth"

58642,58643,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.174,CLAUDIO,"Such as move men, beside, she hath prosperous art"
58643,58644,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.175,CLAUDIO,"When she will play with reason and discourse,"
58644,58645,Measure for measure,77.0,1.2.176,CLAUDIO,And well she can persuade.

58648,58649,Measure for measure,78.0,1.2.180,LUCIO,would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a

58657,58658,Measure for measure,1.0,1.3.2,DUKE VINCENTIO,Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
58658,58659,Measure for measure,1.0,1.3.3,DUKE VINCENTIO,Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
58659,58660,Measure for measure,1.0,1.3.4,DUKE VINCENTIO,"To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose"
58660,58661,Measure for measure,1.0,1.3.5,DUKE VINCENTIO,More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
58661,58662,Measure for measure,1.0,1.3.6,DUKE VINCENTIO,Of burning youth.
58662,58663,Measure for measure,2.0,1.3.7,FRIAR THOMAS,May your grace speak of it?

58665,58666,Measure for measure,3.0,1.3.10,DUKE VINCENTIO,And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
58666,58667,Measure for measure,3.0,1.3.11,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps."
58667,58668,Measure for measure,3.0,1.3.12,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,"

58672,58673,Measure for measure,3.0,1.3.17,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And so it is received. Now, pious sir,"
58673,58674,Measure for measure,3.0,1.3.18,DUKE VINCENTIO,You will demand of me why I do this?
58674,58675,Measure for measure,4.0,1.3.19,FRIAR THOMAS,"Gladly, my lord."

58681,58682,Measure for measure,5.0,1.3.26,DUKE VINCENTIO,Only to stick it in their children's sight
58682,58683,Measure for measure,5.0,1.3.27,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For terror, not to use, in time the rod"

58688,58689,Measure for measure,6.0,1.3.33,FRIAR THOMAS,It rested in your grace
58689,58690,Measure for measure,6.0,1.3.34,FRIAR THOMAS,To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
58690,58691,Measure for measure,6.0,1.3.35,FRIAR THOMAS,And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
58691,58692,Measure for measure,6.0,1.3.36,FRIAR THOMAS,Than in Lord Angelo.

58697,58698,Measure for measure,7.0,1.3.42,DUKE VINCENTIO,"And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,"
58698,58699,Measure for measure,7.0,1.3.43,DUKE VINCENTIO,"I have on Angelo imposed the office,"
58699,58700,Measure for measure,7.0,1.3.44,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,"

58706,58707,Measure for measure,7.0,1.3.51,DUKE VINCENTIO,Like a true friar. More reasons for this action

59449,59450,Measure for measure,15.0,2.4.60,ISABELLA,I had rather give my body than my soul.
59450,59451,Measure for measure,16.0,2.4.61,ANGELO,I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
59451,59452,Measure for measure,16.0,2.4.62,ANGELO,Stand more for number than for accompt.
59452,59453,Measure for measure,17.0,2.4.63,ISABELLA,How say you?
59453,59454,Measure for measure,18.0,2.4.64,ANGELO,"Nay, I'll not warrant that, for I can speak"
59454,59455,Measure for measure,18.0,2.4.65,ANGELO,Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
59455,59456,Measure for measure,18.0,2.4.66,ANGELO,"I, now the voice of the recorded law,"
59456,59457,Measure for measure,18.0,2.4.67,ANGELO,Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
59457,59458,Measure for measure,18.0,2.4.68,ANGELO,Might there not be a charity in sin
59458,59459,Measure for measure,18.0,2.4.69,ANGELO,To save this brother's life?
59459,59460,Measure for measure,19.0,2.4.70,ISABELLA,"Please you to do't,"
59460,59461,Measure for measure,19.0,2.4.71,ISABELLA,"I'll take it as a peril to my soul,"
59461,59462,Measure for measure,19.0,2.4.72,ISABELLA,"It is no sin at all, but charity."
59462,59463,Measure for measure,20.0,2.4.73,ANGELO,"Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,"
59463,59464,Measure for measure,20.0,2.4.74,ANGELO,Were equal poise of sin and charity.
59464,59465,Measure for measure,21.0,2.4.75,ISABELLA,"That I do beg his life, if it be sin,"
59465,59466,Measure for measure,21.0,2.4.76,ISABELLA,"Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,"
59466,59467,Measure for measure,21.0,2.4.77,ISABELLA,"If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer"
59467,59468,Measure for measure,21.0,2.4.78,ISABELLA,"To have it added to the faults of mine,"
59468,59469,Measure for measure,21.0,2.4.79,ISABELLA,And nothing of your answer.
59469,59470,Measure for measure,22.0,2.4.80,ANGELO,"Nay, but hear me."
59470,59471,Measure for measure,22.0,2.4.81,ANGELO,"Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,"
59471,59472,Measure for measure,22.0,2.4.82,ANGELO,"Or seem so craftily, and that's not good."
59472,59473,Measure for measure,23.0,2.4.83,ISABELLA,"Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,"
59473,59474,Measure for measure,23.0,2.4.84,ISABELLA,But graciously to know I am no better.
59474,59475,Measure for measure,24.0,2.4.85,ANGELO,Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
59475,59476,Measure for measure,24.0,2.4.86,ANGELO,"When it doth tax itself, as these black masks"
59476,59477,Measure for measure,24.0,2.4.87,ANGELO,Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
59477,59478,Measure for measure,24.0,2.4.88,ANGELO,"Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me,"

59479,59480,Measure for measure,24.0,2.4.90,ANGELO,Your brother is to die.
59480,59481,Measure for measure,25.0,2.4.91,ISABELLA,So.
59481,59482,Measure for measure,26.0,2.4.92,ANGELO,"And his offence is so, as it appears,"
59482,59483,Measure for measure,26.0,2.4.93,ANGELO,Accountant to the law upon that pain.
59483,59484,Measure for measure,27.0,2.4.94,ISABELLA,True.
59484,59485,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.95,ANGELO,"Admit no other way to save his life,--"
59485,59486,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.96,ANGELO,"As I subscribe not that, nor any other,"
59486,59487,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.97,ANGELO,"But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,"
59487,59488,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.98,ANGELO,"Finding yourself desired of such a person,"
59488,59489,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.99,ANGELO,"Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,"
59489,59490,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.100,ANGELO,Could fetch your brother from the manacles
59490,59491,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.101,ANGELO,"Of the all-building law, and that there were"

59492,59493,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.103,ANGELO,You must lay down the treasures of your body
59493,59494,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.104,ANGELO,"To this supposed, or else to let him suffer,"
59494,59495,Measure for measure,28.0,2.4.105,ANGELO,What would you do?
59495,59496,Measure for measure,29.0,2.4.106,ISABELLA,As much for my poor brother as myself:
59496,59497,Measure for measure,29.0,2.4.107,ISABELLA,"That is, were I under the terms of death,"
59497,59498,Measure for measure,29.0,2.4.108,ISABELLA,"The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,"
59498,59499,Measure for measure,29.0,2.4.109,ISABELLA,"And strip myself to death, as to a bed"
59499,59500,Measure for measure,29.0,2.4.110,ISABELLA,"That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield"
59500,59501,Measure for measure,29.0,2.4.111,ISABELLA,My body up to shame.
59501,59502,Measure for measure,30.0,2.4.112,ANGELO,Then must your brother die.
59502,59503,Measure for measure,31.0,2.4.113,ISABELLA,And 'twere the cheaper way:
59503,59504,Measure for measure,31.0,2.4.114,ISABELLA,"Better it were a brother died at once,"
59504,59505,Measure for measure,31.0,2.4.115,ISABELLA,"Than that a sister, by redeeming him,"
59505,59506,Measure for measure,31.0,2.4.116,ISABELLA,Should die for ever.
59506,59507,Measure for measure,32.0,2.4.117,ANGELO,Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
59507,59508,Measure for measure,32.0,2.4.118,ANGELO,That you have slander'd so?
59508,59509,Measure for measure,33.0,2.4.119,ISABELLA,Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
59509,59510,Measure for measure,33.0,2.4.120,ISABELLA,Are of two houses: lawful mercy
59510,59511,Measure for measure,33.0,2.4.121,ISABELLA,Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
59511,59512,Measure for measure,34.0,2.4.122,ANGELO,"You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant,"
59512,59513,Measure for measure,34.0,2.4.123,ANGELO,And rather proved the sliding of your brother
59513,59514,Measure for measure,34.0,2.4.124,ANGELO,A merriment than a vice.
59514,59515,Measure for measure,35.0,2.4.125,ISABELLA,"O, pardon me, my lord, it oft falls out,"
59515,59516,Measure for measure,35.0,2.4.126,ISABELLA,"To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:"

59517,59518,Measure for measure,35.0,2.4.128,ISABELLA,For his advantage that I dearly love.
59518,59519,Measure for measure,36.0,2.4.129,ANGELO,We are all frail.
59519,59520,Measure for measure,37.0,2.4.130,ISABELLA,"Else let my brother die,"

59527,59528,Measure for measure,39.0,2.4.138,ISABELLA,"For we are soft as our complexions are,"
59528,59529,Measure for measure,39.0,2.4.139,ISABELLA,And credulous to false prints.
59529,59530,Measure for measure,40.0,2.4.140,ANGELO,I think it well:

59531,59532,Measure for measure,40.0,2.4.142,ANGELO,Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
59532,59533,Measure for measure,40.0,2.4.143,ANGELO,"Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold,"

59539,59540,Measure for measure,41.0,2.4.150,ISABELLA,Let me entreat you speak the former language.
59540,59541,Measure for measure,42.0,2.4.151,ANGELO,"Plainly conceive, I love you."
59541,59542,Measure for measure,43.0,2.4.152,ISABELLA,"My brother did love Juliet,"
59542,59543,Measure for measure,43.0,2.4.153,ISABELLA,And you tell me that he shall die for it.
59543,59544,Measure for measure,44.0,2.4.154,ANGELO,"He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love."
59544,59545,Measure for measure,45.0,2.4.155,ISABELLA,"I know your virtue hath a licence in't,"
59545,59546,Measure for measure,45.0,2.4.156,ISABELLA,"Which seems a little fouler than it is,"
59546,59547,Measure for measure,45.0,2.4.157,ISABELLA,To pluck on others.
59547,59548,Measure for measure,46.0,2.4.158,ANGELO,"Believe me, on mine honour,"
59548,59549,Measure for measure,46.0,2.4.159,ANGELO,My words express my purpose.
59549,59550,Measure for measure,47.0,2.4.160,ISABELLA,"Ha! little honour to be much believed,"

59599,59600,Measure for measure,3.0,3.1.6,DUKE VINCENTIO,Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:

59703,59704,Measure for measure,31.0,3.1.108,ISABELLA,"Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,"
59704,59705,Measure for measure,31.0,3.1.109,ISABELLA,So to offend him still. This night's the time

59715,59716,Measure for measure,36.0,3.1.120,CLAUDIO,"When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,"
59716,59717,Measure for measure,36.0,3.1.121,CLAUDIO,"Or of the deadly seven, it is the least."
59717,59718,Measure for measure,37.0,3.1.122,ISABELLA,Which is the least?

59759,59760,Measure for measure,47.0,3.1.164,ISABELLA,Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:

59777,59778,Measure for measure,53.0,3.1.180,DUKE VINCENTIO,"glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I"
59778,59779,Measure for measure,53.0,3.1.181,DUKE VINCENTIO,"know this to be true, therefore prepare yourself to"
59779,59780,Measure for measure,53.0,3.1.182,DUKE VINCENTIO,death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes

59781,59782,Measure for measure,53.0,3.1.184,DUKE VINCENTIO,your knees and make ready.

59803,59804,Measure for measure,60.0,3.1.203,ISABELLA,I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my

59805,59806,Measure for measure,60.0,3.1.205,ISABELLA,"unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke"
59806,59807,Measure for measure,60.0,3.1.206,ISABELLA,deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
59807,59808,Measure for measure,60.0,3.1.207,ISABELLA,"speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or"
59808,59809,Measure for measure,60.0,3.1.208,ISABELLA,discover his government.
59809,59810,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.209,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter"
59810,59811,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.210,DUKE VINCENTIO,"now stands, he will avoid your accusation, he made"
59811,59812,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.211,DUKE VINCENTIO,trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
59812,59813,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.212,DUKE VINCENTIO,advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
59813,59814,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.213,DUKE VINCENTIO,remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
59814,59815,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.214,DUKE VINCENTIO,that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
59815,59816,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.215,DUKE VINCENTIO,"lady a merited benefit, redeem your brother from"

59818,59819,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.218,DUKE VINCENTIO,peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
59819,59820,Measure for measure,61.0,3.1.219,DUKE VINCENTIO,this business.
59820,59821,Measure for measure,62.0,3.1.220,ISABELLA,Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
59821,59822,Measure for measure,62.0,3.1.221,ISABELLA,anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
59822,59823,Measure for measure,63.0,3.1.222,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have"

59831,59832,Measure for measure,65.0,3.1.231,DUKE VINCENTIO,sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
59832,59833,Measure for measure,65.0,3.1.232,DUKE VINCENTIO,poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
59833,59834,Measure for measure,65.0,3.1.233,DUKE VINCENTIO,"renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most"
59834,59835,Measure for measure,65.0,3.1.234,DUKE VINCENTIO,"kind and natural, with him, the portion and sinew of"

59837,59838,Measure for measure,66.0,3.1.237,ISABELLA,Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
59838,59839,Measure for measure,67.0,3.1.238,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them"
59839,59840,Measure for measure,67.0,3.1.239,DUKE VINCENTIO,"with his comfort, swallowed his vows whole,"

59843,59844,Measure for measure,67.0,3.1.243,DUKE VINCENTIO,"is washed with them, but relents not."
59844,59845,Measure for measure,68.0,3.1.244,ISABELLA,What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid

59847,59848,Measure for measure,69.0,3.1.247,DUKE VINCENTIO,It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the

59850,59851,Measure for measure,70.0,3.1.250,ISABELLA,"Show me how, good father."
59851,59852,Measure for measure,71.0,3.1.251,DUKE VINCENTIO,This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance

59868,59869,Measure for measure,71.0,3.1.268,DUKE VINCENTIO,will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
59869,59870,Measure for measure,71.0,3.1.269,DUKE VINCENTIO,"think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness"
59870,59871,Measure for measure,71.0,3.1.270,DUKE VINCENTIO,of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
59871,59872,Measure for measure,71.0,3.1.271,DUKE VINCENTIO,What think you of it?
59872,59873,Measure for measure,72.0,3.1.272,ISABELLA,"The image of it gives me content already, and I"

59981,59982,Measure for measure,38.0,3.2.95,DUKE VINCENTIO,"It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it."
59982,59983,Measure for measure,39.0,3.2.96,LUCIO,"Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred,"
59983,59984,Measure for measure,39.0,3.2.97,LUCIO,it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp

59985,59986,Measure for measure,39.0,3.2.99,LUCIO,down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
59986,59987,Measure for measure,39.0,3.2.100,LUCIO,woman after this downright way of creation: is it
59987,59988,Measure for measure,39.0,3.2.101,LUCIO,"true, think you?"
59988,59989,Measure for measure,40.0,3.2.102,DUKE VINCENTIO,"How should he be made, then?"
59989,59990,Measure for measure,41.0,3.2.103,LUCIO,"Some report a sea-maid spawned him, some, that he"
59990,59991,Measure for measure,41.0,3.2.104,LUCIO,was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
59991,59992,Measure for measure,41.0,3.2.105,LUCIO,certain that when he makes water his urine is
59992,59993,Measure for measure,41.0,3.2.106,LUCIO,"congealed ice, that I know to be true: and he is a"

59995,59996,Measure for measure,43.0,3.2.109,LUCIO,"Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the"
59996,59997,Measure for measure,43.0,3.2.110,LUCIO,rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
59997,59998,Measure for measure,43.0,3.2.111,LUCIO,man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
59998,59999,Measure for measure,43.0,3.2.112,LUCIO,Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a

60000,60001,Measure for measure,43.0,3.2.114,LUCIO,a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
60001,60002,Measure for measure,43.0,3.2.115,LUCIO,"knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy."
60002,60003,Measure for measure,44.0,3.2.116,DUKE VINCENTIO,I never heard the absent duke much detected for

60023,60024,Measure for measure,54.0,3.2.137,DUKE VINCENTIO,helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better

60050,60051,Measure for measure,65.0,3.2.164,LUCIO,Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
60051,60052,Measure for measure,65.0,3.2.165,LUCIO,the duke we talk of were returned again: the
60052,60053,Measure for measure,65.0,3.2.166,LUCIO,ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with

60864,60865,Measure for measure,32.0,5.1.100,DUKE VINCENTIO,To speak before your time. Proceed.
60865,60866,Measure for measure,33.0,5.1.101,ISABELLA,I went
60866,60867,Measure for measure,33.0,5.1.102,ISABELLA,"To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--"
60867,60868,Measure for measure,34.0,5.1.103,DUKE VINCENTIO,That's somewhat madly spoken.
60868,60869,Measure for measure,35.0,5.1.104,ISABELLA,"Pardon it,"
60869,60870,Measure for measure,35.0,5.1.105,ISABELLA,The phrase is to the matter.
60870,60871,Measure for measure,36.0,5.1.106,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Mended again. The matter, proceed."
60871,60872,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.107,ISABELLA,"In brief, to set the needless process by,"
60872,60873,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.108,ISABELLA,"How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,"
60873,60874,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.109,ISABELLA,"How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--"
60874,60875,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.110,ISABELLA,"For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion"
60875,60876,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.111,ISABELLA,I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
60876,60877,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.112,ISABELLA,"He would not, but by gift of my chaste body"
60877,60878,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.113,ISABELLA,"To his concupiscible intemperate lust,"
60878,60879,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.114,ISABELLA,"Release my brother, and, after much debatement,"
60879,60880,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.115,ISABELLA,"My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,"
60880,60881,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.116,ISABELLA,"And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,"
60881,60882,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.117,ISABELLA,"His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant"
60882,60883,Measure for measure,37.0,5.1.118,ISABELLA,For my poor brother's head.
60883,60884,Measure for measure,38.0,5.1.119,DUKE VINCENTIO,This is most likely!
60884,60885,Measure for measure,39.0,5.1.120,ISABELLA,"O, that it were as like as it is true!"
60885,60886,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.121,DUKE VINCENTIO,"By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,"
60886,60887,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.122,DUKE VINCENTIO,Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
60887,60888,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.123,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In hateful practise. First, his integrity"
60888,60889,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.124,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason"
60889,60890,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.125,DUKE VINCENTIO,That with such vehemency he should pursue
60890,60891,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.126,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,"
60891,60892,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.127,DUKE VINCENTIO,He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
60892,60893,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.128,DUKE VINCENTIO,And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
60893,60894,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.129,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Confess the truth, and say by whose advice"
60894,60895,Measure for measure,40.0,5.1.130,DUKE VINCENTIO,Thou camest here to complain.
60895,60896,Measure for measure,41.0,5.1.131,ISABELLA,And is this all?
60896,60897,Measure for measure,41.0,5.1.132,ISABELLA,"Then, O you blessed ministers above,"
60897,60898,Measure for measure,41.0,5.1.133,ISABELLA,"Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time"
60898,60899,Measure for measure,41.0,5.1.134,ISABELLA,Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
60899,60900,Measure for measure,41.0,5.1.135,ISABELLA,"In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,"
60900,60901,Measure for measure,41.0,5.1.136,ISABELLA,"As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!"
60901,60902,Measure for measure,42.0,5.1.137,DUKE VINCENTIO,I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
60902,60903,Measure for measure,42.0,5.1.138,DUKE VINCENTIO,To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
60903,60904,Measure for measure,42.0,5.1.139,DUKE VINCENTIO,A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
60904,60905,Measure for measure,42.0,5.1.140,DUKE VINCENTIO,On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
60905,60906,Measure for measure,42.0,5.1.141,DUKE VINCENTIO,Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
60906,60907,Measure for measure,43.0,5.1.142,ISABELLA,"One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick."
60907,60908,Measure for measure,44.0,5.1.143,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?"
60908,60909,Measure for measure,45.0,5.1.144,LUCIO,"My lord, I know him, 'tis a meddling friar,"
60909,60910,Measure for measure,45.0,5.1.145,LUCIO,"I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord"
60910,60911,Measure for measure,45.0,5.1.146,LUCIO,For certain words he spake against your grace
60911,60912,Measure for measure,45.0,5.1.147,LUCIO,"In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly."
60912,60913,Measure for measure,46.0,5.1.148,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!"
60913,60914,Measure for measure,46.0,5.1.149,DUKE VINCENTIO,And to set on this wretched woman here
60914,60915,Measure for measure,46.0,5.1.150,DUKE VINCENTIO,Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
60915,60916,Measure for measure,47.0,5.1.151,LUCIO,"But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,"
60916,60917,Measure for measure,47.0,5.1.152,LUCIO,"I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,"
60917,60918,Measure for measure,47.0,5.1.153,LUCIO,A very scurvy fellow.
60918,60919,Measure for measure,48.0,5.1.154,FRIAR PETER,Blessed be your royal grace!
60919,60920,Measure for measure,48.0,5.1.155,FRIAR PETER,"I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard"
60920,60921,Measure for measure,48.0,5.1.156,FRIAR PETER,"Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman"
60921,60922,Measure for measure,48.0,5.1.157,FRIAR PETER,"Most wrongfully accused your substitute,"
60922,60923,Measure for measure,48.0,5.1.158,FRIAR PETER,Who is as free from touch or soil with her
60923,60924,Measure for measure,48.0,5.1.159,FRIAR PETER,As she from one ungot.
60924,60925,Measure for measure,49.0,5.1.160,DUKE VINCENTIO,We did believe no less.
60925,60926,Measure for measure,49.0,5.1.161,DUKE VINCENTIO,Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
60926,60927,Measure for measure,50.0,5.1.162,FRIAR PETER,"I know him for a man divine and holy,"
60927,60928,Measure for measure,50.0,5.1.163,FRIAR PETER,"Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,"
60928,60929,Measure for measure,50.0,5.1.164,FRIAR PETER,"As he's reported by this gentleman,"
60929,60930,Measure for measure,50.0,5.1.165,FRIAR PETER,"And, on my trust, a man that never yet"
60930,60931,Measure for measure,50.0,5.1.166,FRIAR PETER,"Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace."
60931,60932,Measure for measure,51.0,5.1.167,LUCIO,"My lord, most villanously, believe it."
60932,60933,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.168,FRIAR PETER,"Well, he in time may come to clear himself,"
60933,60934,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.169,FRIAR PETER,"But at this instant he is sick my lord,"
60934,60935,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.170,FRIAR PETER,"Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,"
60935,60936,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.171,FRIAR PETER,Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
60936,60937,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.172,FRIAR PETER,"Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,"
60937,60938,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.173,FRIAR PETER,"To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know"
60938,60939,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.174,FRIAR PETER,"Is true and false, and what he with his oath"
60939,60940,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.175,FRIAR PETER,"And all probation will make up full clear,"
60940,60941,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.176,FRIAR PETER,"Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman."
60941,60942,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.177,FRIAR PETER,"To justify this worthy nobleman,"
60942,60943,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.178,FRIAR PETER,"So vulgarly and personally accused,"
60943,60944,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.179,FRIAR PETER,"Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,"
60944,60945,Measure for measure,52.0,5.1.180,FRIAR PETER,Till she herself confess it.
60945,60946,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.181,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Good friar, let's hear it."
60946,60947,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.181,DUKE VINCENTIO,"ISABELLA is carried off guarded, and MARIANA comes forward"
60947,60948,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.182,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?"
60948,60949,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.183,DUKE VINCENTIO,"O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!"
60949,60950,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.184,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo,"
60950,60951,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.185,DUKE VINCENTIO,"In this I'll be impartial, be you judge"
60951,60952,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.186,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?"
60952,60953,Measure for measure,53.0,5.1.187,DUKE VINCENTIO,"First, let her show her face, and after speak."
60953,60954,Measure for measure,54.0,5.1.188,MARIANA,"Pardon, my lord, I will not show my face"
60954,60955,Measure for measure,54.0,5.1.189,MARIANA,Until my husband bid me.
60955,60956,Measure for measure,55.0,5.1.190,DUKE VINCENTIO,"What, are you married?"
60956,60957,Measure for measure,56.0,5.1.191,MARIANA,"No, my lord."
60957,60958,Measure for measure,57.0,5.1.192,DUKE VINCENTIO,Are you a maid?
60958,60959,Measure for measure,58.0,5.1.193,MARIANA,"No, my lord."
60959,60960,Measure for measure,59.0,5.1.194,DUKE VINCENTIO,"A widow, then?"
60960,60961,Measure for measure,60.0,5.1.195,MARIANA,"Neither, my lord."
60961,60962,Measure for measure,61.0,5.1.196,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?"
60962,60963,Measure for measure,62.0,5.1.197,LUCIO,"My lord, she may be a punk, for many of them are"
60963,60964,Measure for measure,62.0,5.1.198,LUCIO,"neither maid, widow, nor wife."
60964,60965,Measure for measure,63.0,5.1.199,DUKE VINCENTIO,Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
60965,60966,Measure for measure,63.0,5.1.200,DUKE VINCENTIO,To prattle for himself.
60966,60967,Measure for measure,64.0,5.1.201,LUCIO,"Well, my lord."
60967,60968,Measure for measure,65.0,5.1.202,MARIANA,"My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married,"
60968,60969,Measure for measure,65.0,5.1.203,MARIANA,And I confess besides I am no maid:
60969,60970,Measure for measure,65.0,5.1.204,MARIANA,"I have known my husband, yet my husband"
60970,60971,Measure for measure,65.0,5.1.205,MARIANA,Knows not that ever he knew me.
60971,60972,Measure for measure,66.0,5.1.206,LUCIO,"He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better."
60972,60973,Measure for measure,67.0,5.1.207,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!"
60973,60974,Measure for measure,68.0,5.1.208,LUCIO,"Well, my lord."
60974,60975,Measure for measure,69.0,5.1.209,DUKE VINCENTIO,This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
60975,60976,Measure for measure,70.0,5.1.210,MARIANA,Now I come to't my lord
60976,60977,Measure for measure,70.0,5.1.211,MARIANA,"She that accuses him of fornication,"
60977,60978,Measure for measure,70.0,5.1.212,MARIANA,"In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,"
60978,60979,Measure for measure,70.0,5.1.213,MARIANA,"And charges him my lord, with such a time"
60979,60980,Measure for measure,70.0,5.1.214,MARIANA,When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
60980,60981,Measure for measure,70.0,5.1.215,MARIANA,With all the effect of love.
60981,60982,Measure for measure,71.0,5.1.216,ANGELO,Charges she more than me?
60982,60983,Measure for measure,72.0,5.1.217,MARIANA,Not that I know.
60983,60984,Measure for measure,73.0,5.1.218,DUKE VINCENTIO,No? you say your husband.
60984,60985,Measure for measure,74.0,5.1.219,MARIANA,"Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,"
60985,60986,Measure for measure,74.0,5.1.220,MARIANA,"Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,"
60986,60987,Measure for measure,74.0,5.1.221,MARIANA,But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
60987,60988,Measure for measure,75.0,5.1.222,ANGELO,This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
60988,60989,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.223,MARIANA,"My husband bids me, now I will unmask."
60989,60990,Measure for measure,76.0,,MARIANA,Unveiling
60990,60991,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.224,MARIANA,"This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,"
60991,60992,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.225,MARIANA,"Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on,"
60992,60993,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.226,MARIANA,"This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,"
60993,60994,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.227,MARIANA,"Was fast belock'd in thine, this is the body"
60994,60995,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.228,MARIANA,"That took away the match from Isabel,"
60995,60996,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.229,MARIANA,And did supply thee at thy garden-house
60996,60997,Measure for measure,76.0,5.1.230,MARIANA,In her imagined person.
60997,60998,Measure for measure,77.0,5.1.231,DUKE VINCENTIO,Know you this woman?
60998,60999,Measure for measure,78.0,5.1.232,LUCIO,"Carnally, she says."
60999,61000,Measure for measure,79.0,5.1.233,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Sirrah, no more!"
61000,61001,Measure for measure,80.0,5.1.234,LUCIO,"Enough, my lord."
61001,61002,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.235,ANGELO,"My lord, I must confess I know this woman:"
61002,61003,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.236,ANGELO,And five years since there was some speech of marriage
61003,61004,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.237,ANGELO,"Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off,"
61004,61005,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.238,ANGELO,Partly for that her promised proportions
61005,61006,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.239,ANGELO,"Came short of composition, but in chief"
61006,61007,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.240,ANGELO,For that her reputation was disvalued
61007,61008,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.241,ANGELO,In levity: since which time of five years
61008,61009,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.242,ANGELO,"I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,"
61009,61010,Measure for measure,81.0,5.1.243,ANGELO,Upon my faith and honour.
61010,61011,Measure for measure,82.0,5.1.244,MARIANA,"Noble prince,"

61014,61015,Measure for measure,82.0,5.1.248,MARIANA,"As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,"
61015,61016,Measure for measure,82.0,5.1.249,MARIANA,But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
61016,61017,Measure for measure,82.0,5.1.250,MARIANA,"He knew me as a wife. As this is true,"
61017,61018,Measure for measure,82.0,5.1.251,MARIANA,Let me in safety raise me from my knees
61018,61019,Measure for measure,82.0,5.1.252,MARIANA,"Or else for ever be confixed here,"
61019,61020,Measure for measure,82.0,5.1.253,MARIANA,A marble monument!
61020,61021,Measure for measure,83.0,5.1.254,ANGELO,I did but smile till now:

61022,61023,Measure for measure,83.0,5.1.256,ANGELO,My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive

61025,61026,Measure for measure,83.0,5.1.259,ANGELO,"That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,"
61026,61027,Measure for measure,83.0,5.1.260,ANGELO,To find this practise out.

61242,61243,Measure for measure,145.0,5.1.465,DUKE VINCENTIO,Against all sense you do importune her:

61261,61262,Measure for measure,148.0,5.1.483,ISABELLA,In that he did the thing for which he died:

61263,61264,Measure for measure,148.0,5.1.485,ISABELLA,"His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,"
61264,61265,Measure for measure,148.0,5.1.486,ISABELLA,And must be buried but as an intent

61271,61272,Measure for measure,150.0,5.1.493,DUKE VINCENTIO,At an unusual hour?
61272,61273,Measure for measure,151.0,5.1.494,Provost,It was commanded so.
61273,61274,Measure for measure,152.0,5.1.495,DUKE VINCENTIO,Had you a special warrant for the deed?
61274,61275,Measure for measure,153.0,5.1.496,Provost,"No, my good lord, it was by private message."
61275,61276,Measure for measure,154.0,5.1.497,DUKE VINCENTIO,For which I do discharge you of your office:
61276,61277,Measure for measure,154.0,5.1.498,DUKE VINCENTIO,Give up your keys.
61277,61278,Measure for measure,155.0,5.1.499,Provost,"Pardon me, noble lord:"
61278,61279,Measure for measure,155.0,5.1.500,Provost,"I thought it was a fault, but knew it not,"
61279,61280,Measure for measure,155.0,5.1.501,Provost,"Yet did repent me, after more advice,"
61280,61281,Measure for measure,155.0,5.1.502,Provost,"For testimony whereof, one in the prison,"

61282,61283,Measure for measure,155.0,5.1.504,Provost,I have reserved alive.
61283,61284,Measure for measure,156.0,5.1.505,DUKE VINCENTIO,What's he?
61284,61285,Measure for measure,157.0,5.1.506,Provost,His name is Barnardine.
61285,61286,Measure for measure,158.0,5.1.507,DUKE VINCENTIO,I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
61286,61287,Measure for measure,158.0,5.1.508,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Go fetch him hither, let me look upon him."

61290,61291,Measure for measure,159.0,5.1.511,ESCALUS,"Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood."
61291,61292,Measure for measure,159.0,5.1.512,ESCALUS,And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
61292,61293,Measure for measure,160.0,5.1.513,ANGELO,I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
61293,61294,Measure for measure,160.0,5.1.514,ANGELO,And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
61294,61295,Measure for measure,160.0,5.1.515,ANGELO,"That I crave death more willingly than mercy,"
61295,61296,Measure for measure,160.0,5.1.516,ANGELO,"'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it."

61298,61299,Measure for measure,162.0,5.1.518,Provost,"This, my lord."
61299,61300,Measure for measure,163.0,5.1.519,DUKE VINCENTIO,There was a friar told me of this man.

61301,61302,Measure for measure,163.0,5.1.521,DUKE VINCENTIO,"That apprehends no further than this world,"
61302,61303,Measure for measure,163.0,5.1.522,DUKE VINCENTIO,And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
61303,61304,Measure for measure,163.0,5.1.523,DUKE VINCENTIO,"But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all,"
61304,61305,Measure for measure,163.0,5.1.524,DUKE VINCENTIO,And pray thee take this mercy to provide
61305,61306,Measure for measure,163.0,5.1.525,DUKE VINCENTIO,"For better times to come. Friar, advise him,"
61306,61307,Measure for measure,163.0,5.1.526,DUKE VINCENTIO,I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
61307,61308,Measure for measure,164.0,5.1.527,Provost,This is another prisoner that I saved.
61308,61309,Measure for measure,164.0,5.1.528,Provost,"Who should have died when Claudio lost his head,"
61309,61310,Measure for measure,164.0,5.1.529,Provost,As like almost to Claudio as himself.
61310,61311,Measure for measure,164.0,,Provost,Unmuffles CLAUDIO

61313,61314,Measure for measure,165.0,5.1.532,DUKE VINCENTIO,Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
61314,61315,Measure for measure,165.0,5.1.533,DUKE VINCENTIO,He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.

61316,61317,Measure for measure,165.0,5.1.535,DUKE VINCENTIO,Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
61317,61318,Measure for measure,165.0,5.1.536,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:"

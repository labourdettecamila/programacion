32433,32434,Hamlet,138.0,,CYMBELINE,SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
32434,32435,Hamlet,138.0,,CYMBELINE,FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
32435,32436,Hamlet,1.0,1.1.1,BERNARDO,Who's there?
32436,32437,Hamlet,2.0,1.1.2,FRANCISCO,"Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself."
32437,32438,Hamlet,3.0,1.1.3,BERNARDO,Long live the king!
32438,32439,Hamlet,4.0,1.1.4,FRANCISCO,Bernardo?
32439,32440,Hamlet,5.0,1.1.5,BERNARDO,He.
32440,32441,Hamlet,6.0,1.1.6,FRANCISCO,You come most carefully upon your hour.
32441,32442,Hamlet,7.0,1.1.7,BERNARDO,"'Tis now struck twelve, get thee to bed, Francisco."
32442,32443,Hamlet,8.0,1.1.8,FRANCISCO,"For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,"
32443,32444,Hamlet,8.0,1.1.9,FRANCISCO,And I am sick at heart.
32444,32445,Hamlet,9.0,1.1.10,BERNARDO,Have you had quiet guard?
32445,32446,Hamlet,10.0,1.1.11,FRANCISCO,Not a mouse stirring.
32446,32447,Hamlet,11.0,1.1.12,BERNARDO,"Well, good night."
32447,32448,Hamlet,11.0,1.1.13,BERNARDO,"If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,"
32448,32449,Hamlet,11.0,1.1.14,BERNARDO,"The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste."
32449,32450,Hamlet,12.0,1.1.15,FRANCISCO,"I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?"
32450,32451,Hamlet,12.0,,FRANCISCO,Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
32451,32452,Hamlet,13.0,1.1.16,HORATIO,Friends to this ground.
32452,32453,Hamlet,14.0,1.1.17,MARCELLUS,And liegemen to the Dane.
32453,32454,Hamlet,15.0,1.1.18,FRANCISCO,Give you good night.
32454,32455,Hamlet,16.0,1.1.19,MARCELLUS,"O, farewell, honest soldier:"
32455,32456,Hamlet,16.0,1.1.20,MARCELLUS,Who hath relieved you?
32456,32457,Hamlet,17.0,1.1.21,FRANCISCO,Bernardo has my place.
32457,32458,Hamlet,17.0,1.1.22,FRANCISCO,Give you good night.
32458,32459,Hamlet,17.0,,FRANCISCO,Exit
32459,32460,Hamlet,18.0,1.1.23,MARCELLUS,Holla! Bernardo!
32460,32461,Hamlet,19.0,1.1.24,BERNARDO,"Say,"
32461,32462,Hamlet,19.0,1.1.25,BERNARDO,"What, is Horatio there?"
32462,32463,Hamlet,20.0,1.1.26,HORATIO,A piece of him.
32463,32464,Hamlet,21.0,1.1.27,BERNARDO,"Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus."
32464,32465,Hamlet,22.0,1.1.28,MARCELLUS,"What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?"
32465,32466,Hamlet,23.0,1.1.29,BERNARDO,I have seen nothing.
32466,32467,Hamlet,24.0,1.1.30,MARCELLUS,"Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,"
32467,32468,Hamlet,24.0,1.1.31,MARCELLUS,And will not let belief take hold of him
32468,32469,Hamlet,24.0,1.1.32,MARCELLUS,"Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:"
32469,32470,Hamlet,24.0,1.1.33,MARCELLUS,Therefore I have entreated him along
32470,32471,Hamlet,24.0,1.1.34,MARCELLUS,"With us to watch the minutes of this night,"
32471,32472,Hamlet,24.0,1.1.35,MARCELLUS,"That if again this apparition come,"
32472,32473,Hamlet,24.0,1.1.36,MARCELLUS,He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
32473,32474,Hamlet,25.0,1.1.37,HORATIO,"Tush, tush, 'twill not appear."
32474,32475,Hamlet,26.0,1.1.38,BERNARDO,"Sit down awhile,"
32475,32476,Hamlet,26.0,1.1.39,BERNARDO,"And let us once again assail your ears,"
32476,32477,Hamlet,26.0,1.1.40,BERNARDO,That are so fortified against our story
32477,32478,Hamlet,26.0,1.1.41,BERNARDO,What we have two nights seen.
32478,32479,Hamlet,27.0,1.1.42,HORATIO,"Well, sit we down,"
32479,32480,Hamlet,27.0,1.1.43,HORATIO,And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
32480,32481,Hamlet,28.0,1.1.44,BERNARDO,"Last night of all,"
32481,32482,Hamlet,28.0,1.1.45,BERNARDO,When yond same star that's westward from the pole
32482,32483,Hamlet,28.0,1.1.46,BERNARDO,Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
32483,32484,Hamlet,28.0,1.1.47,BERNARDO,"Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,"
32484,32485,Hamlet,28.0,1.1.48,BERNARDO,"The bell then beating one,--"
32485,32486,Hamlet,28.0,,BERNARDO,Enter Ghost
32486,32487,Hamlet,29.0,1.1.49,MARCELLUS,"Peace, break thee off, look, where it comes again!"
32487,32488,Hamlet,30.0,1.1.50,BERNARDO,"In the same figure, like the king that's dead."
32488,32489,Hamlet,31.0,1.1.51,MARCELLUS,"Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio."
32489,32490,Hamlet,32.0,1.1.52,BERNARDO,"Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio."
32490,32491,Hamlet,33.0,1.1.53,HORATIO,Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
32491,32492,Hamlet,34.0,1.1.54,BERNARDO,It would be spoke to.
32492,32493,Hamlet,35.0,1.1.55,MARCELLUS,"Question it, Horatio."
32493,32494,Hamlet,36.0,1.1.56,HORATIO,"What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,"
32494,32495,Hamlet,36.0,1.1.57,HORATIO,Together with that fair and warlike form
32495,32496,Hamlet,36.0,1.1.58,HORATIO,In which the majesty of buried Denmark
32496,32497,Hamlet,36.0,1.1.59,HORATIO,"Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!"
32497,32498,Hamlet,37.0,1.1.60,MARCELLUS,It is offended.
32498,32499,Hamlet,38.0,1.1.61,BERNARDO,"See, it stalks away!"
32499,32500,Hamlet,39.0,1.1.62,HORATIO,"Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!"
32500,32501,Hamlet,39.0,,HORATIO,Exit Ghost
32501,32502,Hamlet,40.0,1.1.63,MARCELLUS,"'Tis gone, and will not answer."
32502,32503,Hamlet,41.0,1.1.64,BERNARDO,"How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:"
32503,32504,Hamlet,41.0,1.1.65,BERNARDO,Is not this something more than fantasy?
32504,32505,Hamlet,41.0,1.1.66,BERNARDO,What think you on't?
32505,32506,Hamlet,42.0,1.1.67,HORATIO,"Before my God, I might not this believe"
32506,32507,Hamlet,42.0,1.1.68,HORATIO,Without the sensible and true avouch
32507,32508,Hamlet,42.0,1.1.69,HORATIO,Of mine own eyes.
32508,32509,Hamlet,43.0,1.1.70,MARCELLUS,Is it not like the king?
32509,32510,Hamlet,44.0,1.1.71,HORATIO,As thou art to thyself:
32510,32511,Hamlet,44.0,1.1.72,HORATIO,Such was the very armour he had on
32511,32512,Hamlet,44.0,1.1.73,HORATIO,"When he the ambitious Norway combated,"
32512,32513,Hamlet,44.0,1.1.74,HORATIO,"So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,"
32513,32514,Hamlet,44.0,1.1.75,HORATIO,He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
32514,32515,Hamlet,44.0,1.1.76,HORATIO,'Tis strange.
32515,32516,Hamlet,45.0,1.1.77,MARCELLUS,"Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,"
32516,32517,Hamlet,45.0,1.1.78,MARCELLUS,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
32517,32518,Hamlet,46.0,1.1.79,HORATIO,"In what particular thought to work I know not,"
32518,32519,Hamlet,46.0,1.1.80,HORATIO,"But in the gross and scope of my opinion,"
32519,32520,Hamlet,46.0,1.1.81,HORATIO,This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
32520,32521,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.82,MARCELLUS,"Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,"
32521,32522,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.83,MARCELLUS,Why this same strict and most observant watch
32522,32523,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.84,MARCELLUS,"So nightly toils the subject of the land,"
32523,32524,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.85,MARCELLUS,"And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,"
32524,32525,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.86,MARCELLUS,"And foreign mart for implements of war,"
32525,32526,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.87,MARCELLUS,"Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task"
32526,32527,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.88,MARCELLUS,"Does not divide the Sunday from the week,"
32527,32528,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.89,MARCELLUS,"What might be toward, that this sweaty haste"
32528,32529,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.90,MARCELLUS,Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
32529,32530,Hamlet,47.0,1.1.91,MARCELLUS,Who is't that can inform me?
32530,32531,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.92,HORATIO,"That can I,"
32531,32532,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.93,HORATIO,"At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,"
32532,32533,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.94,HORATIO,"Whose image even but now appear'd to us,"
32533,32534,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.95,HORATIO,"Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,"
32534,32535,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.96,HORATIO,"Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,"
32535,32536,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.97,HORATIO,"Dared to the combat, in which our valiant Hamlet--"
32536,32537,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.98,HORATIO,For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
32537,32538,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.99,HORATIO,"Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a seal'd compact,"
32538,32539,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.100,HORATIO,"Well ratified by law and heraldry,"
32539,32540,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.101,HORATIO,"Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands"
32540,32541,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.102,HORATIO,"Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:"
32541,32542,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.103,HORATIO,"Against the which, a moiety competent"
32542,32543,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.104,HORATIO,"Was gaged by our king, which had return'd"
32543,32544,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.105,HORATIO,"To the inheritance of Fortinbras,"
32544,32545,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.106,HORATIO,"Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenant,"
32545,32546,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.107,HORATIO,"And carriage of the article design'd,"
32546,32547,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.108,HORATIO,"His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,"
32547,32548,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.109,HORATIO,"Of unimproved mettle hot and full,"
32548,32549,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.110,HORATIO,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
32549,32550,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.111,HORATIO,"Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,"
32550,32551,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.112,HORATIO,"For food and diet, to some enterprise"
32551,32552,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.113,HORATIO,"That hath a stomach in't, which is no other--"
32552,32553,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.114,HORATIO,As it doth well appear unto our state--
32553,32554,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.115,HORATIO,"But to recover of us, by strong hand"
32554,32555,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.116,HORATIO,"And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands"
32555,32556,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.117,HORATIO,"So by his father lost: and this, I take it,"
32556,32557,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.118,HORATIO,"Is the main motive of our preparations,"
32557,32558,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.119,HORATIO,The source of this our watch and the chief head
32558,32559,Hamlet,48.0,1.1.120,HORATIO,Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
32559,32560,Hamlet,49.0,1.1.121,BERNARDO,I think it be no other but e'en so:
32560,32561,Hamlet,49.0,1.1.122,BERNARDO,Well may it sort that this portentous figure
32561,32562,Hamlet,49.0,1.1.123,BERNARDO,"Comes armed through our watch, so like the king"
32562,32563,Hamlet,49.0,1.1.124,BERNARDO,That was and is the question of these wars.
32563,32564,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.125,HORATIO,A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
32564,32565,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.126,HORATIO,"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,"
32565,32566,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.127,HORATIO,"A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,"
32566,32567,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.128,HORATIO,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
32567,32568,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.129,HORATIO,Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
32568,32569,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.130,HORATIO,"As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,"
32569,32570,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.131,HORATIO,"Disasters in the sun, and the moist star"
32570,32571,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.132,HORATIO,Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
32571,32572,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.133,HORATIO,Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
32572,32573,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.134,HORATIO,"And even the like precurse of fierce events,"
32573,32574,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.135,HORATIO,As harbingers preceding still the fates
32574,32575,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.136,HORATIO,"And prologue to the omen coming on,"
32575,32576,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.137,HORATIO,Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
32576,32577,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.138,HORATIO,Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
32577,32578,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.139,HORATIO,"But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!"
32578,32579,Hamlet,50.0,,HORATIO,Re-enter Ghost
32579,32580,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.140,HORATIO,"I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!"
32580,32581,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.141,HORATIO,"If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,"
32581,32582,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.142,HORATIO,Speak to me:
32582,32583,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.143,HORATIO,"If there be any good thing to be done,"
32583,32584,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.144,HORATIO,"That may to thee do ease and grace to me,"
32584,32585,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.145,HORATIO,Speak to me:
32585,32586,Hamlet,50.0,,HORATIO,Cock crows
32586,32587,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.146,HORATIO,"If thou art privy to thy country's fate,"
32587,32588,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.147,HORATIO,"Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!"
32588,32589,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.148,HORATIO,Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
32589,32590,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.149,HORATIO,"Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,"
32590,32591,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.150,HORATIO,"For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,"
32591,32592,Hamlet,50.0,1.1.151,HORATIO,"Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus."
32592,32593,Hamlet,51.0,1.1.152,MARCELLUS,Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
32593,32594,Hamlet,52.0,1.1.153,HORATIO,"Do, if it will not stand."
32594,32595,Hamlet,53.0,1.1.154,BERNARDO,'Tis here!
32595,32596,Hamlet,54.0,1.1.155,HORATIO,'Tis here!
32596,32597,Hamlet,55.0,1.1.156,MARCELLUS,'Tis gone!
32597,32598,Hamlet,55.0,,MARCELLUS,Exit Ghost
32598,32599,Hamlet,55.0,1.1.157,MARCELLUS,"We do it wrong, being so majestical,"
32599,32600,Hamlet,55.0,1.1.158,MARCELLUS,"To offer it the show of violence,"
32600,32601,Hamlet,55.0,1.1.159,MARCELLUS,"For it is, as the air, invulnerable,"
32601,32602,Hamlet,55.0,1.1.160,MARCELLUS,And our vain blows malicious mockery.
32602,32603,Hamlet,56.0,1.1.161,BERNARDO,"It was about to speak, when the cock crew."
32603,32604,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.162,HORATIO,And then it started like a guilty thing
32604,32605,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.163,HORATIO,"Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,"
32605,32606,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.164,HORATIO,"The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,"
32606,32607,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.165,HORATIO,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
32607,32608,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.166,HORATIO,"Awake the god of day, and, at his warning,"
32608,32609,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.167,HORATIO,"Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,"
32609,32610,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.168,HORATIO,The extravagant and erring spirit hies
32610,32611,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.169,HORATIO,To his confine: and of the truth herein
32611,32612,Hamlet,57.0,1.1.170,HORATIO,This present object made probation.
32612,32613,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.171,MARCELLUS,It faded on the crowing of the cock.
32613,32614,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.172,MARCELLUS,Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
32614,32615,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.173,MARCELLUS,"Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,"
32615,32616,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.174,MARCELLUS,The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
32616,32617,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.175,MARCELLUS,"And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad,"
32617,32618,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.176,MARCELLUS,"The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,"
32618,32619,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.177,MARCELLUS,"No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,"
32619,32620,Hamlet,58.0,1.1.178,MARCELLUS,So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
32620,32621,Hamlet,59.0,1.1.179,HORATIO,So have I heard and do in part believe it.
32621,32622,Hamlet,59.0,1.1.180,HORATIO,"But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,"
32622,32623,Hamlet,59.0,1.1.181,HORATIO,Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
32623,32624,Hamlet,59.0,1.1.182,HORATIO,"Break we our watch up, and by my advice,"

32706,32707,Hamlet,12.0,1.2.72,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Seek for thy noble father in the dust:

32711,32712,Hamlet,14.0,1.2.77,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Why seems it so particular with thee?
32712,32713,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.78,HAMLET,"Seems, madam! nay it is, I know not 'seems.'"
32713,32714,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.79,HAMLET,"'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,"
32714,32715,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.80,HAMLET,"Nor customary suits of solemn black,"
32715,32716,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.81,HAMLET,"Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,"
32716,32717,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.82,HAMLET,"No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,"
32717,32718,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.83,HAMLET,"Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,"

32719,32720,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.85,HAMLET,"That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,"
32720,32721,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.86,HAMLET,For they are actions that a man might play:
32721,32722,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.87,HAMLET,"But I have that within which passeth show,"
32722,32723,Hamlet,15.0,1.2.88,HAMLET,These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
32723,32724,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.89,KING CLAUDIUS,"'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,"
32724,32725,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.90,KING CLAUDIUS,To give these mourning duties to your father:

32728,32729,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.94,KING CLAUDIUS,To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
32729,32730,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.95,KING CLAUDIUS,In obstinate condolement is a course
32730,32731,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.96,KING CLAUDIUS,"Of impious stubbornness, 'tis unmanly grief,"
32731,32732,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.97,KING CLAUDIUS,"It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,"
32732,32733,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.98,KING CLAUDIUS,"A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,"
32733,32734,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.99,KING CLAUDIUS,An understanding simple and unschool'd:
32734,32735,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.100,KING CLAUDIUS,For what we know must be and is as common
32735,32736,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.101,KING CLAUDIUS,"As any the most vulgar thing to sense,"
32736,32737,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.102,KING CLAUDIUS,Why should we in our peevish opposition

32738,32739,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.104,KING CLAUDIUS,"A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,"
32739,32740,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.105,KING CLAUDIUS,To reason most absurd: whose common theme
32740,32741,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.106,KING CLAUDIUS,"Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,"
32741,32742,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.107,KING CLAUDIUS,"From the first corse till he that died to-day,"
32742,32743,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.108,KING CLAUDIUS,"'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth"
32743,32744,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.109,KING CLAUDIUS,"This unprevailing woe, and think of us"

32745,32746,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.111,KING CLAUDIUS,"You are the most immediate to our throne,"
32746,32747,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.112,KING CLAUDIUS,And with no less nobility of love
32747,32748,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.113,KING CLAUDIUS,"Than that which dearest father bears his son,"
32748,32749,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.114,KING CLAUDIUS,Do I impart toward you. For your intent

32750,32751,Hamlet,16.0,1.2.116,KING CLAUDIUS,It is most retrograde to our desire:

32809,32810,Hamlet,28.0,1.2.173,HAMLET,"Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,"
32810,32811,Hamlet,28.0,1.2.174,HAMLET,To make it truster of your own report
32811,32812,Hamlet,28.0,1.2.175,HAMLET,Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
32812,32813,Hamlet,28.0,1.2.176,HAMLET,But what is your affair in Elsinore?
32813,32814,Hamlet,28.0,1.2.177,HAMLET,We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
32814,32815,Hamlet,29.0,1.2.178,HORATIO,"My lord, I came to see your father's funeral."
32815,32816,Hamlet,30.0,1.2.179,HAMLET,"I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student,"
32816,32817,Hamlet,30.0,1.2.180,HAMLET,I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
32817,32818,Hamlet,31.0,1.2.181,HORATIO,"Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon."
32818,32819,Hamlet,32.0,1.2.182,HAMLET,"Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats"
32819,32820,Hamlet,32.0,1.2.183,HAMLET,Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
32820,32821,Hamlet,32.0,1.2.184,HAMLET,Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
32821,32822,Hamlet,32.0,1.2.185,HAMLET,"Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!"
32822,32823,Hamlet,32.0,1.2.186,HAMLET,My father!--methinks I see my father.
32823,32824,Hamlet,33.0,1.2.187,HORATIO,"Where, my lord?"
32824,32825,Hamlet,34.0,1.2.188,HAMLET,"In my mind's eye, Horatio."
32825,32826,Hamlet,35.0,1.2.189,HORATIO,"I saw him once, he was a goodly king."
32826,32827,Hamlet,36.0,1.2.190,HAMLET,"He was a man, take him for all in all,"
32827,32828,Hamlet,36.0,1.2.191,HAMLET,I shall not look upon his like again.
32828,32829,Hamlet,37.0,1.2.192,HORATIO,"My lord, I think I saw him yesternight."
32829,32830,Hamlet,38.0,1.2.193,HAMLET,Saw? who?
32830,32831,Hamlet,39.0,1.2.194,HORATIO,"My lord, the king your father."
32831,32832,Hamlet,40.0,1.2.195,HAMLET,The king my father!
32832,32833,Hamlet,41.0,1.2.196,HORATIO,Season your admiration for awhile
32833,32834,Hamlet,41.0,1.2.197,HORATIO,"With an attent ear, till I may deliver,"
32834,32835,Hamlet,41.0,1.2.198,HORATIO,"Upon the witness of these gentlemen,"
32835,32836,Hamlet,41.0,1.2.199,HORATIO,This marvel to you.
32836,32837,Hamlet,42.0,1.2.200,HAMLET,"For God's love, let me hear."
32837,32838,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.201,HORATIO,"Two nights together had these gentlemen,"
32838,32839,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.202,HORATIO,"Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,"
32839,32840,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.203,HORATIO,"In the dead vast and middle of the night,"
32840,32841,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.204,HORATIO,"Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,"
32841,32842,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.205,HORATIO,"Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,"
32842,32843,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.206,HORATIO,"Appears before them, and with solemn march"
32843,32844,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.207,HORATIO,Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
32844,32845,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.208,HORATIO,"By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,"
32845,32846,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.209,HORATIO,"Within his truncheon's length, whilst they, distilled"
32846,32847,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.210,HORATIO,"Almost to jelly with the act of fear,"
32847,32848,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.211,HORATIO,Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
32848,32849,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.212,HORATIO,"In dreadful secrecy impart they did,"
32849,32850,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.213,HORATIO,"And I with them the third night kept the watch,"
32850,32851,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.214,HORATIO,"Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,"
32851,32852,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.215,HORATIO,"Form of the thing, each word made true and good,"
32852,32853,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.216,HORATIO,"The apparition comes: I knew your father,"
32853,32854,Hamlet,43.0,1.2.217,HORATIO,These hands are not more like.
32854,32855,Hamlet,44.0,1.2.218,HAMLET,But where was this?
32855,32856,Hamlet,45.0,1.2.219,MARCELLUS,"My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd."
32856,32857,Hamlet,46.0,1.2.220,HAMLET,Did you not speak to it?
32857,32858,Hamlet,47.0,1.2.221,HORATIO,"My lord, I did,"
32858,32859,Hamlet,47.0,1.2.222,HORATIO,But answer made it none: yet once methought
32859,32860,Hamlet,47.0,1.2.223,HORATIO,It lifted up its head and did address
32860,32861,Hamlet,47.0,1.2.224,HORATIO,"Itself to motion, like as it would speak,"
32861,32862,Hamlet,47.0,1.2.225,HORATIO,"But even then the morning cock crew loud,"
32862,32863,Hamlet,47.0,1.2.226,HORATIO,"And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,"
32863,32864,Hamlet,47.0,1.2.227,HORATIO,And vanish'd from our sight.
32864,32865,Hamlet,48.0,1.2.228,HAMLET,'Tis very strange.
32865,32866,Hamlet,49.0,1.2.229,HORATIO,"As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true,"
32866,32867,Hamlet,49.0,1.2.230,HORATIO,And we did think it writ down in our duty
32867,32868,Hamlet,49.0,1.2.231,HORATIO,To let you know of it.
32868,32869,Hamlet,50.0,1.2.232,HAMLET,"Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me."
32869,32870,Hamlet,50.0,1.2.233,HAMLET,Hold you the watch to-night?
32870,32871,Hamlet,52.0,1.2.234,BERNARDO,"We do, my lord."
32871,32872,Hamlet,53.0,1.2.235,HAMLET,"Arm'd, say you?"
32872,32873,Hamlet,55.0,1.2.236,BERNARDO,"Arm'd, my lord."
32873,32874,Hamlet,56.0,1.2.237,HAMLET,From top to toe?
32874,32875,Hamlet,58.0,1.2.238,BERNARDO,"My lord, from head to foot."
32875,32876,Hamlet,59.0,1.2.239,HAMLET,Then saw you not his face?
32876,32877,Hamlet,60.0,1.2.240,HORATIO,"O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up."
32877,32878,Hamlet,61.0,1.2.241,HAMLET,"What, look'd he frowningly?"
32878,32879,Hamlet,62.0,1.2.242,HORATIO,A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
32879,32880,Hamlet,63.0,1.2.243,HAMLET,Pale or red?
32880,32881,Hamlet,64.0,1.2.244,HORATIO,"Nay, very pale."
32881,32882,Hamlet,65.0,1.2.245,HAMLET,And fix'd his eyes upon you?
32882,32883,Hamlet,66.0,1.2.246,HORATIO,Most constantly.
32883,32884,Hamlet,67.0,1.2.247,HAMLET,I would I had been there.
32884,32885,Hamlet,68.0,1.2.248,HORATIO,It would have much amazed you.
32885,32886,Hamlet,69.0,1.2.249,HAMLET,"Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?"
32886,32887,Hamlet,70.0,1.2.250,HORATIO,While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
32887,32888,Hamlet,72.0,1.2.251,BERNARDO,"Longer, longer."
32888,32889,Hamlet,73.0,1.2.252,HORATIO,Not when I saw't.
32889,32890,Hamlet,74.0,1.2.253,HAMLET,His beard was grizzled--no?
32890,32891,Hamlet,75.0,1.2.254,HORATIO,"It was, as I have seen it in his life,"
32891,32892,Hamlet,75.0,1.2.255,HORATIO,A sable silver'd.
32892,32893,Hamlet,76.0,1.2.256,HAMLET,"I will watch to-night,"
32893,32894,Hamlet,76.0,1.2.257,HAMLET,Perchance 'twill walk again.
32894,32895,Hamlet,77.0,1.2.258,HORATIO,I warrant it will.
32895,32896,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.259,HAMLET,"If it assume my noble father's person,"
32896,32897,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.260,HAMLET,"I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape"
32897,32898,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.261,HAMLET,"And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,"
32898,32899,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.262,HAMLET,"If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,"
32899,32900,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.263,HAMLET,"Let it be tenable in your silence still,"
32900,32901,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.264,HAMLET,"And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,"
32901,32902,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.265,HAMLET,"Give it an understanding, but no tongue:"
32902,32903,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.266,HAMLET,"I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:"
32903,32904,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.267,HAMLET,"Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,"
32904,32905,Hamlet,78.0,1.2.268,HAMLET,I'll visit you.
32905,32906,Hamlet,79.0,1.2.269,All,Our duty to your honour.
32906,32907,Hamlet,80.0,1.2.270,HAMLET,"Your loves, as mine to you: farewell."
32907,32908,Hamlet,80.0,,HAMLET,Exeunt all but HAMLET
32908,32909,Hamlet,80.0,1.2.271,HAMLET,"My father's spirit in arms! all is not well,"
32909,32910,Hamlet,80.0,1.2.272,HAMLET,I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
32910,32911,Hamlet,80.0,1.2.273,HAMLET,"Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,"
32911,32912,Hamlet,80.0,1.2.274,HAMLET,"Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."
32912,32913,Hamlet,80.0,,HAMLET,Exit
32913,32914,Hamlet,80.0,,HAMLET,SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
32914,32915,Hamlet,80.0,,HAMLET,Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
32915,32916,Hamlet,1.0,1.3.1,LAERTES,My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
32916,32917,Hamlet,1.0,1.3.2,LAERTES,"And, sister, as the winds give benefit"
32917,32918,Hamlet,1.0,1.3.3,LAERTES,"And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,"
32918,32919,Hamlet,1.0,1.3.4,LAERTES,But let me hear from you.
32919,32920,Hamlet,2.0,1.3.5,OPHELIA,Do you doubt that?
32920,32921,Hamlet,3.0,1.3.6,LAERTES,"For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,"
32921,32922,Hamlet,3.0,1.3.7,LAERTES,"Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,"
32922,32923,Hamlet,3.0,1.3.8,LAERTES,"A violet in the youth of primy nature,"
32923,32924,Hamlet,3.0,1.3.9,LAERTES,"Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,"
32924,32925,Hamlet,3.0,1.3.10,LAERTES,"The perfume and suppliance of a minute, No more."
32925,32926,Hamlet,4.0,1.3.11,OPHELIA,No more but so?
32926,32927,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.12,LAERTES,"Think it no more,"
32927,32928,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.13,LAERTES,"For nature, crescent, does not grow alone"
32928,32929,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.14,LAERTES,"In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,"
32929,32930,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.15,LAERTES,The inward service of the mind and soul
32930,32931,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.16,LAERTES,"Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,"
32931,32932,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.17,LAERTES,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
32932,32933,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.18,LAERTES,"The virtue of his will: but you must fear,"
32933,32934,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.19,LAERTES,"His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own,"
32934,32935,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.20,LAERTES,For he himself is subject to his birth:
32935,32936,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.21,LAERTES,"He may not, as unvalued persons do,"
32936,32937,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.22,LAERTES,"Carve for himself, for on his choice depends"
32937,32938,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.23,LAERTES,"The safety and health of this whole state,"
32938,32939,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.24,LAERTES,And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
32939,32940,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.25,LAERTES,Unto the voice and yielding of that body
32940,32941,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.26,LAERTES,"Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,"
32941,32942,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.27,LAERTES,It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
32942,32943,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.28,LAERTES,As he in his particular act and place
32943,32944,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.29,LAERTES,"May give his saying deed, which is no further"
32944,32945,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.30,LAERTES,Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
32945,32946,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.31,LAERTES,"Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,"
32946,32947,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.32,LAERTES,"If with too credent ear you list his songs,"
32947,32948,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.33,LAERTES,"Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open"
32948,32949,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.34,LAERTES,To his unmaster'd importunity.
32949,32950,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.35,LAERTES,"Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,"
32950,32951,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.36,LAERTES,"And keep you in the rear of your affection,"
32951,32952,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.37,LAERTES,Out of the shot and danger of desire.
32952,32953,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.38,LAERTES,"The chariest maid is prodigal enough,"
32953,32954,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.39,LAERTES,If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
32954,32955,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.40,LAERTES,Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
32955,32956,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.41,LAERTES,"The canker galls the infants of the spring,"
32956,32957,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.42,LAERTES,"Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,"
32957,32958,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.43,LAERTES,And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
32958,32959,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.44,LAERTES,Contagious blastments are most imminent.
32959,32960,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.45,LAERTES,"Be wary then, best safety lies in fear:"
32960,32961,Hamlet,5.0,1.3.46,LAERTES,"Youth to itself rebels, though none else near."
32961,32962,Hamlet,6.0,1.3.47,OPHELIA,"I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,"
32962,32963,Hamlet,6.0,1.3.48,OPHELIA,"As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,"
32963,32964,Hamlet,6.0,1.3.49,OPHELIA,"Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,"
32964,32965,Hamlet,6.0,1.3.50,OPHELIA,"Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,"
32965,32966,Hamlet,6.0,1.3.51,OPHELIA,"Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,"
32966,32967,Hamlet,6.0,1.3.52,OPHELIA,"Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,"
32967,32968,Hamlet,6.0,1.3.53,OPHELIA,And recks not his own rede.
32968,32969,Hamlet,7.0,1.3.54,LAERTES,"O, fear me not."
32969,32970,Hamlet,7.0,1.3.55,LAERTES,I stay too long: but here my father comes.
32970,32971,Hamlet,7.0,,LAERTES,Enter POLONIUS
32971,32972,Hamlet,7.0,1.3.56,LAERTES,"A double blessing is a double grace,"
32972,32973,Hamlet,7.0,1.3.57,LAERTES,Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
32973,32974,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.58,LORD POLONIUS,"Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!"
32974,32975,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.59,LORD POLONIUS,"The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,"
32975,32976,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.60,LORD POLONIUS,"And you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with thee!"
32976,32977,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.61,LORD POLONIUS,And these few precepts in thy memory
32977,32978,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.62,LORD POLONIUS,"See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,"
32978,32979,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.63,LORD POLONIUS,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
32979,32980,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.64,LORD POLONIUS,"Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar."
32980,32981,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.65,LORD POLONIUS,"Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,"
32981,32982,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.66,LORD POLONIUS,"Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,"
32982,32983,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.67,LORD POLONIUS,But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
32983,32984,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.68,LORD POLONIUS,"Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware"
32984,32985,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.69,LORD POLONIUS,"Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,"
32985,32986,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.70,LORD POLONIUS,Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
32986,32987,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.71,LORD POLONIUS,"Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,"
32987,32988,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.72,LORD POLONIUS,"Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment."
32988,32989,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.73,LORD POLONIUS,"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,"
32989,32990,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.74,LORD POLONIUS,"But not express'd in fancy, rich, not gaudy,"
32990,32991,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.75,LORD POLONIUS,"For the apparel oft proclaims the man,"
32991,32992,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.76,LORD POLONIUS,And they in France of the best rank and station
32992,32993,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.77,LORD POLONIUS,Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
32993,32994,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.78,LORD POLONIUS,"Neither a borrower nor a lender be,"
32994,32995,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.79,LORD POLONIUS,"For loan oft loses both itself and friend,"
32995,32996,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.80,LORD POLONIUS,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
32996,32997,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.81,LORD POLONIUS,"This above all: to thine ownself be true,"

32998,32999,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.83,LORD POLONIUS,Thou canst not then be false to any man.
32999,33000,Hamlet,8.0,1.3.84,LORD POLONIUS,Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

33009,33010,Hamlet,15.0,1.3.93,OPHELIA,"So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet."
33010,33011,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.94,LORD POLONIUS,"Marry, well bethought:"
33011,33012,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.95,LORD POLONIUS,"'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late"
33012,33013,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.96,LORD POLONIUS,"Given private time to you, and you yourself"
33013,33014,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.97,LORD POLONIUS,Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
33014,33015,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.98,LORD POLONIUS,"If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,"
33015,33016,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.99,LORD POLONIUS,"And that in way of caution, I must tell you,"
33016,33017,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.100,LORD POLONIUS,You do not understand yourself so clearly
33017,33018,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.101,LORD POLONIUS,As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
33018,33019,Hamlet,16.0,1.3.102,LORD POLONIUS,What is between you? give me up the truth.
33019,33020,Hamlet,17.0,1.3.103,OPHELIA,"He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders"
33020,33021,Hamlet,17.0,1.3.104,OPHELIA,Of his affection to me.
33021,33022,Hamlet,18.0,1.3.105,LORD POLONIUS,"Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,"
33022,33023,Hamlet,18.0,1.3.106,LORD POLONIUS,Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
33023,33024,Hamlet,18.0,1.3.107,LORD POLONIUS,"Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?"
33024,33025,Hamlet,19.0,1.3.108,OPHELIA,"I do not know, my lord, what I should think."
33025,33026,Hamlet,20.0,1.3.109,LORD POLONIUS,"Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby,"
33026,33027,Hamlet,20.0,1.3.110,LORD POLONIUS,"That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,"
33027,33028,Hamlet,20.0,1.3.111,LORD POLONIUS,"Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,"
33028,33029,Hamlet,20.0,1.3.112,LORD POLONIUS,"Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,"
33029,33030,Hamlet,20.0,1.3.113,LORD POLONIUS,Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.

33031,33032,Hamlet,21.0,1.3.115,OPHELIA,In honourable fashion.
33032,33033,Hamlet,22.0,1.3.116,LORD POLONIUS,"Ay, fashion you may call it, go to, go to."
33033,33034,Hamlet,23.0,1.3.117,OPHELIA,"And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,"
33034,33035,Hamlet,23.0,1.3.118,OPHELIA,With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
33035,33036,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.119,LORD POLONIUS,"Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,"
33036,33037,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.120,LORD POLONIUS,"When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul"
33037,33038,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.121,LORD POLONIUS,"Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,"
33038,33039,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.122,LORD POLONIUS,"Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,"

33040,33041,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.124,LORD POLONIUS,You must not take for fire. From this time

33042,33043,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.126,LORD POLONIUS,Set your entreatments at a higher rate
33043,33044,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.127,LORD POLONIUS,"Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,"
33044,33045,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.128,LORD POLONIUS,"Believe so much in him, that he is young"
33045,33046,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.129,LORD POLONIUS,And with a larger tether may he walk
33046,33047,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.130,LORD POLONIUS,"Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,"
33047,33048,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.131,LORD POLONIUS,"Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,"
33048,33049,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.132,LORD POLONIUS,"Not of that dye which their investments show,"
33049,33050,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.133,LORD POLONIUS,"But mere implorators of unholy suits,"
33050,33051,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.134,LORD POLONIUS,"Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,"
33051,33052,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.135,LORD POLONIUS,The better to beguile. This is for all:
33052,33053,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.136,LORD POLONIUS,"I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,"
33053,33054,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.137,LORD POLONIUS,"Have you so slander any moment leisure,"
33054,33055,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.138,LORD POLONIUS,As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
33055,33056,Hamlet,24.0,1.3.139,LORD POLONIUS,"Look to't, I charge you: come your ways."
33056,33057,Hamlet,25.0,1.3.140,OPHELIA,"I shall obey, my lord."

33061,33062,Hamlet,2.0,1.4.2,HORATIO,It is a nipping and an eager air.
33062,33063,Hamlet,3.0,1.4.3,HAMLET,What hour now?
33063,33064,Hamlet,4.0,1.4.4,HORATIO,I think it lacks of twelve.
33064,33065,Hamlet,5.0,1.4.5,HAMLET,"No, it is struck."
33065,33066,Hamlet,6.0,1.4.6,HORATIO,Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
33066,33067,Hamlet,6.0,1.4.7,HORATIO,Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
33067,33068,Hamlet,6.0,,HORATIO,"A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within"

33069,33070,Hamlet,7.0,1.4.9,HAMLET,"The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,"
33070,33071,Hamlet,7.0,1.4.10,HAMLET,"Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels,"
33071,33072,Hamlet,7.0,1.4.11,HAMLET,"And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,"
33072,33073,Hamlet,7.0,1.4.12,HAMLET,The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
33073,33074,Hamlet,7.0,1.4.13,HAMLET,The triumph of his pledge.
33074,33075,Hamlet,8.0,1.4.14,HORATIO,Is it a custom?
33075,33076,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.15,HAMLET,"Ay, marry, is't:"
33076,33077,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.16,HAMLET,"But to my mind, though I am native here"
33077,33078,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.17,HAMLET,"And to the manner born, it is a custom"
33078,33079,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.18,HAMLET,More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
33079,33080,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.19,HAMLET,This heavy-headed revel east and west
33080,33081,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.20,HAMLET,Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
33081,33082,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.21,HAMLET,"They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase"
33082,33083,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.22,HAMLET,"Soil our addition, and indeed it takes"

33084,33085,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.24,HAMLET,The pith and marrow of our attribute.
33085,33086,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.25,HAMLET,"So, oft it chances in particular men,"
33086,33087,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.26,HAMLET,"That for some vicious mole of nature in them,"
33087,33088,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.27,HAMLET,"As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,"
33088,33089,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.28,HAMLET,Since nature cannot choose his origin--
33089,33090,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.29,HAMLET,"By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,"
33090,33091,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.30,HAMLET,"Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,"
33091,33092,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.31,HAMLET,Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
33092,33093,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.32,HAMLET,"The form of plausive manners, that these men,"
33093,33094,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.33,HAMLET,"Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,"

33098,33099,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.38,HAMLET,From that particular fault: the dram of eale
33099,33100,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.39,HAMLET,Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
33100,33101,Hamlet,9.0,1.4.40,HAMLET,To his own scandal.
33101,33102,Hamlet,10.0,1.4.41,HORATIO,"Look, my lord, it comes!"

33121,33122,Hamlet,11.0,1.4.60,HAMLET,"Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?"
33122,33123,Hamlet,11.0,,HAMLET,Ghost beckons HAMLET

33124,33125,Hamlet,12.0,1.4.62,HORATIO,As if it some impartment did desire
33125,33126,Hamlet,12.0,1.4.63,HORATIO,To you alone.
33126,33127,Hamlet,13.0,1.4.64,MARCELLUS,"Look, with what courteous action"
33127,33128,Hamlet,13.0,1.4.65,MARCELLUS,It waves you to a more removed ground:
33128,33129,Hamlet,13.0,1.4.66,MARCELLUS,But do not go with it.
33129,33130,Hamlet,14.0,1.4.67,HORATIO,"No, by no means."

33135,33136,Hamlet,17.0,1.4.73,HAMLET,Being a thing immortal as itself?
33136,33137,Hamlet,17.0,1.4.74,HAMLET,It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
33137,33138,Hamlet,18.0,1.4.75,HORATIO,"What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,"
33138,33139,Hamlet,18.0,1.4.76,HORATIO,Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff

33147,33148,Hamlet,19.0,1.4.85,HAMLET,It waves me still.

33220,33221,Hamlet,18.0,1.5.53,Ghost,"From me, whose love was of that dignity"
33221,33222,Hamlet,18.0,1.5.54,Ghost,That it went hand in hand even with the vow

33256,33257,Hamlet,18.0,1.5.89,Ghost,"But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,"
33257,33258,Hamlet,18.0,1.5.90,Ghost,"Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive"

33267,33268,Hamlet,19.0,1.5.99,HAMLET,"And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,"
33268,33269,Hamlet,19.0,1.5.100,HAMLET,But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
33269,33270,Hamlet,19.0,1.5.101,HAMLET,"Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat"

33281,33282,Hamlet,19.0,1.5.113,HAMLET,"That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain,"
33282,33283,Hamlet,19.0,1.5.114,HAMLET,At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:

33302,33303,Hamlet,34.0,1.5.132,HAMLET,But you'll be secret?
33303,33304,Hamlet,36.0,1.5.133,MARCELLUS,"Ay, by heaven, my lord."
33304,33305,Hamlet,37.0,1.5.134,HAMLET,There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
33305,33306,Hamlet,37.0,1.5.135,HAMLET,But he's an arrant knave.

33310,33311,Hamlet,39.0,1.5.140,HAMLET,I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
33311,33312,Hamlet,39.0,1.5.141,HAMLET,"You, as your business and desire shall point you,"
33312,33313,Hamlet,39.0,1.5.142,HAMLET,"For every man has business and desire,"

33324,33325,Hamlet,43.0,1.5.154,HAMLET,"As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,"
33325,33326,Hamlet,43.0,1.5.155,HAMLET,Give me one poor request.
33326,33327,Hamlet,44.0,1.5.156,HORATIO,"What is't, my lord? we will."

33387,33388,Hamlet,3.0,2.1.3,LORD POLONIUS,"You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,"
33388,33389,Hamlet,3.0,2.1.4,LORD POLONIUS,"Before you visit him, to make inquire"
33389,33390,Hamlet,3.0,2.1.5,LORD POLONIUS,Of his behavior.
33390,33391,Hamlet,4.0,2.1.6,REYNALDO,"My lord, I did intend it."
33391,33392,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.7,LORD POLONIUS,"Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,"
33392,33393,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.8,LORD POLONIUS,"Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,"
33393,33394,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.9,LORD POLONIUS,"And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,"
33394,33395,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.10,LORD POLONIUS,"What company, at what expense, and finding"
33395,33396,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.11,LORD POLONIUS,By this encompassment and drift of question
33396,33397,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.12,LORD POLONIUS,"That they do know my son, come you more nearer"
33397,33398,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.13,LORD POLONIUS,Than your particular demands will touch it:
33398,33399,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.14,LORD POLONIUS,"Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him,"
33399,33400,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.15,LORD POLONIUS,"As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,"
33400,33401,Hamlet,5.0,2.1.16,LORD POLONIUS,"And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?"
33401,33402,Hamlet,6.0,2.1.17,REYNALDO,"Ay, very well, my lord."
33402,33403,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.18,LORD POLONIUS,"'And in part him, but' you may say 'not well:"
33403,33404,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.19,LORD POLONIUS,"But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild,"
33404,33405,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.20,LORD POLONIUS,Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
33405,33406,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.21,LORD POLONIUS,"What forgeries you please, marry, none so rank"
33406,33407,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.22,LORD POLONIUS,"As may dishonour him, take heed of that,"
33407,33408,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.23,LORD POLONIUS,"But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips"
33408,33409,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.24,LORD POLONIUS,As are companions noted and most known
33409,33410,Hamlet,7.0,2.1.25,LORD POLONIUS,To youth and liberty.
33410,33411,Hamlet,8.0,2.1.26,REYNALDO,"As gaming, my lord."
33411,33412,Hamlet,9.0,2.1.27,LORD POLONIUS,"Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,"
33412,33413,Hamlet,9.0,2.1.28,LORD POLONIUS,Drabbing: you may go so far.
33413,33414,Hamlet,10.0,2.1.29,REYNALDO,"My lord, that would dishonour him."
33414,33415,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.30,LORD POLONIUS,"'Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge"
33415,33416,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.31,LORD POLONIUS,"You must not put another scandal on him,"
33416,33417,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.32,LORD POLONIUS,"That he is open to incontinency,"
33417,33418,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.33,LORD POLONIUS,That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
33418,33419,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.34,LORD POLONIUS,"That they may seem the taints of liberty,"
33419,33420,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.35,LORD POLONIUS,"The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,"
33420,33421,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.36,LORD POLONIUS,"A savageness in unreclaimed blood,"
33421,33422,Hamlet,11.0,2.1.37,LORD POLONIUS,Of general assault.
33422,33423,Hamlet,12.0,2.1.38,REYNALDO,"But, my good lord,--"
33423,33424,Hamlet,13.0,2.1.39,LORD POLONIUS,Wherefore should you do this?
33424,33425,Hamlet,14.0,2.1.40,REYNALDO,"Ay, my lord,"
33425,33426,Hamlet,14.0,2.1.41,REYNALDO,I would know that.
33426,33427,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.42,LORD POLONIUS,"Marry, sir, here's my drift,"
33427,33428,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.43,LORD POLONIUS,"And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:"
33428,33429,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.44,LORD POLONIUS,"You laying these slight sullies on my son,"
33429,33430,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.45,LORD POLONIUS,"As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,"
33430,33431,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.46,LORD POLONIUS,"Your party in converse, him you would sound,"
33431,33432,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.47,LORD POLONIUS,Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
33432,33433,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.48,LORD POLONIUS,"The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured"
33433,33434,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.49,LORD POLONIUS,"He closes with you in this consequence,"
33434,33435,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.50,LORD POLONIUS,"'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'"
33435,33436,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.51,LORD POLONIUS,According to the phrase or the addition
33436,33437,Hamlet,15.0,2.1.52,LORD POLONIUS,Of man and country.
33437,33438,Hamlet,16.0,2.1.53,REYNALDO,"Very good, my lord."
33438,33439,Hamlet,17.0,2.1.54,LORD POLONIUS,"And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I"
33439,33440,Hamlet,17.0,2.1.55,LORD POLONIUS,"about to say? By the mass, I was about to say"
33440,33441,Hamlet,17.0,2.1.56,LORD POLONIUS,something: where did I leave?
33441,33442,Hamlet,18.0,2.1.57,REYNALDO,"At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'"
33442,33443,Hamlet,18.0,2.1.58,REYNALDO,and 'gentleman.'
33443,33444,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.59,LORD POLONIUS,"At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry,"
33444,33445,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.60,LORD POLONIUS,"He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman,"
33445,33446,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.61,LORD POLONIUS,"I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,"
33446,33447,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.62,LORD POLONIUS,"Or then, or then, with such, or such, and, as you say,"
33447,33448,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.63,LORD POLONIUS,"There was a' gaming, there o'ertook in's rouse,"
33448,33449,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.64,LORD POLONIUS,"There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,"
33449,33450,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.65,LORD POLONIUS,"'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'"
33450,33451,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.66,LORD POLONIUS,"Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth."
33451,33452,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.67,LORD POLONIUS,"See you now,"
33452,33453,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.68,LORD POLONIUS,Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
33453,33454,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.69,LORD POLONIUS,"And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,"
33454,33455,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.70,LORD POLONIUS,"With windlasses and with assays of bias,"
33455,33456,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.71,LORD POLONIUS,By indirections find directions out:
33456,33457,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.72,LORD POLONIUS,"So by my former lecture and advice,"
33457,33458,Hamlet,19.0,2.1.73,LORD POLONIUS,"Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?"
33458,33459,Hamlet,20.0,2.1.74,REYNALDO,"My lord, I have."
33459,33460,Hamlet,21.0,2.1.75,LORD POLONIUS,"God be wi' you, fare you well."
33460,33461,Hamlet,22.0,2.1.76,REYNALDO,Good my lord!
33461,33462,Hamlet,23.0,2.1.77,LORD POLONIUS,Observe his inclination in yourself.
33462,33463,Hamlet,24.0,2.1.78,REYNALDO,"I shall, my lord."
33463,33464,Hamlet,25.0,2.1.79,LORD POLONIUS,And let him ply his music.
33464,33465,Hamlet,26.0,2.1.80,REYNALDO,"Well, my lord."
33465,33466,Hamlet,27.0,2.1.81,LORD POLONIUS,Farewell!
33466,33467,Hamlet,27.0,,LORD POLONIUS,Exit REYNALDO
33467,33468,Hamlet,27.0,,LORD POLONIUS,Enter OPHELIA
33468,33469,Hamlet,27.0,2.1.82,LORD POLONIUS,"How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?"
33469,33470,Hamlet,28.0,2.1.83,OPHELIA,"O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!"
33470,33471,Hamlet,29.0,2.1.84,LORD POLONIUS,"With what, i' the name of God?"
33471,33472,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.85,OPHELIA,"My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,"
33472,33473,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.86,OPHELIA,"Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,"
33473,33474,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.87,OPHELIA,"No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,"
33474,33475,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.88,OPHELIA,"Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle,"
33475,33476,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.89,OPHELIA,"Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,"
33476,33477,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.90,OPHELIA,And with a look so piteous in purport
33477,33478,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.91,OPHELIA,As if he had been loosed out of hell
33478,33479,Hamlet,30.0,2.1.92,OPHELIA,"To speak of horrors,--he comes before me."
33479,33480,Hamlet,31.0,2.1.93,LORD POLONIUS,Mad for thy love?
33480,33481,Hamlet,32.0,2.1.94,OPHELIA,"My lord, I do not know,"
33481,33482,Hamlet,32.0,2.1.95,OPHELIA,"But truly, I do fear it."
33482,33483,Hamlet,33.0,2.1.96,LORD POLONIUS,What said he?
33483,33484,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.97,OPHELIA,"He took me by the wrist and held me hard,"
33484,33485,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.98,OPHELIA,"Then goes he to the length of all his arm,"
33485,33486,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.99,OPHELIA,"And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,"
33486,33487,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.100,OPHELIA,He falls to such perusal of my face
33487,33488,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.101,OPHELIA,"As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so,"
33488,33489,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.102,OPHELIA,"At last, a little shaking of mine arm"
33489,33490,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.103,OPHELIA,"And thrice his head thus waving up and down,"
33490,33491,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.104,OPHELIA,He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
33491,33492,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.105,OPHELIA,As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
33492,33493,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.106,OPHELIA,"And end his being: that done, he lets me go:"
33493,33494,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.107,OPHELIA,"And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,"
33494,33495,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.108,OPHELIA,"He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,"
33495,33496,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.109,OPHELIA,"For out o' doors he went without their helps,"
33496,33497,Hamlet,34.0,2.1.110,OPHELIA,"And, to the last, bended their light on me."
33497,33498,Hamlet,35.0,2.1.111,LORD POLONIUS,"Come, go with me: I will go seek the king."
33498,33499,Hamlet,35.0,2.1.112,LORD POLONIUS,"This is the very ecstasy of love,"
33499,33500,Hamlet,35.0,2.1.113,LORD POLONIUS,Whose violent property fordoes itself
33500,33501,Hamlet,35.0,2.1.114,LORD POLONIUS,And leads the will to desperate undertakings
33501,33502,Hamlet,35.0,2.1.115,LORD POLONIUS,As oft as any passion under heaven
33502,33503,Hamlet,35.0,2.1.116,LORD POLONIUS,That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
33503,33504,Hamlet,35.0,2.1.117,LORD POLONIUS,"What, have you given him any hard words of late?"
33504,33505,Hamlet,36.0,2.1.118,OPHELIA,"No, my good lord, but, as you did command,"
33505,33506,Hamlet,36.0,2.1.119,OPHELIA,I did repel his fetters and denied
33506,33507,Hamlet,36.0,2.1.120,OPHELIA,His access to me.
33507,33508,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.121,LORD POLONIUS,That hath made him mad.
33508,33509,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.122,LORD POLONIUS,I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
33509,33510,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.123,LORD POLONIUS,"I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,"
33510,33511,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.124,LORD POLONIUS,"And meant to wreck thee, but, beshrew my jealousy!"
33511,33512,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.125,LORD POLONIUS,"By heaven, it is as proper to our age"
33512,33513,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.126,LORD POLONIUS,To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
33513,33514,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.127,LORD POLONIUS,As it is common for the younger sort
33514,33515,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.128,LORD POLONIUS,"To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:"
33515,33516,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.129,LORD POLONIUS,"This must be known, which, being kept close, might"
33516,33517,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.130,LORD POLONIUS,move
33517,33518,Hamlet,37.0,2.1.131,LORD POLONIUS,More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

33522,33523,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.2,KING CLAUDIUS,"Moreover that we much did long to see you,"
33523,33524,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.3,KING CLAUDIUS,The need we have to use you did provoke
33524,33525,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.4,KING CLAUDIUS,Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
33525,33526,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.5,KING CLAUDIUS,"Of Hamlet's transformation, so call it,"
33526,33527,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.6,KING CLAUDIUS,Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
33527,33528,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.7,KING CLAUDIUS,"Resembles that it was. What it should be,"
33528,33529,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.8,KING CLAUDIUS,"More than his father's death, that thus hath put him"
33529,33530,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.9,KING CLAUDIUS,"So much from the understanding of himself,"
33530,33531,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.10,KING CLAUDIUS,"I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,"
33531,33532,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.11,KING CLAUDIUS,"That, being of so young days brought up with him,"
33532,33533,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.12,KING CLAUDIUS,"And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,"
33533,33534,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.13,KING CLAUDIUS,That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
33534,33535,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.14,KING CLAUDIUS,Some little time: so by your companies
33535,33536,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.15,KING CLAUDIUS,"To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,"
33536,33537,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.16,KING CLAUDIUS,"So much as from occasion you may glean,"
33537,33538,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.17,KING CLAUDIUS,"Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,"
33538,33539,Hamlet,1.0,2.2.18,KING CLAUDIUS,"That, open'd, lies within our remedy."
33539,33540,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.19,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,"
33540,33541,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.20,QUEEN GERTRUDE,And sure I am two men there are not living
33541,33542,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.21,QUEEN GERTRUDE,To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
33542,33543,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.22,QUEEN GERTRUDE,To show us so much gentry and good will
33543,33544,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.23,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"As to expend your time with us awhile,"
33544,33545,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.24,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"For the supply and profit of our hope,"
33545,33546,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.25,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Your visitation shall receive such thanks
33546,33547,Hamlet,2.0,2.2.26,QUEEN GERTRUDE,As fits a king's remembrance.

33550,33551,Hamlet,3.0,2.2.30,ROSENCRANTZ,Than to entreaty.

33754,33755,Hamlet,58.0,2.2.223,HAMLET,Into my grave.
33755,33756,Hamlet,59.0,2.2.224,LORD POLONIUS,"Indeed, that is out o' the air."
33756,33757,Hamlet,59.0,,LORD POLONIUS,Aside
33757,33758,Hamlet,59.0,2.2.225,LORD POLONIUS,How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness

33759,33760,Hamlet,59.0,2.2.227,LORD POLONIUS,could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will

33776,33777,Hamlet,68.0,2.2.242,ROSENCRANTZ,As the indifferent children of the earth.

33877,33878,Hamlet,108.0,2.2.343,ROSENCRANTZ,I think their inhibition comes by the means of the

34109,34110,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.569,HAMLET,"That he should weep for her? What would he do,"
34110,34111,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.570,HAMLET,Had he the motive and the cue for passion
34111,34112,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.571,HAMLET,That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
34112,34113,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.572,HAMLET,"And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,"
34113,34114,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.573,HAMLET,"Make mad the guilty and appal the free,"
34114,34115,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.574,HAMLET,"Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed"
34115,34116,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.575,HAMLET,"The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,"
34116,34117,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.576,HAMLET,"A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,"
34117,34118,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.577,HAMLET,"Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,"
34118,34119,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.578,HAMLET,"And can say nothing, no, not for a king,"
34119,34120,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.579,HAMLET,Upon whose property and most dear life
34120,34121,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.580,HAMLET,A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
34121,34122,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.581,HAMLET,Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
34122,34123,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.582,HAMLET,"Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?"
34123,34124,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.583,HAMLET,"Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,"
34124,34125,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.584,HAMLET,As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
34125,34126,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.585,HAMLET,Ha!
34126,34127,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.586,HAMLET,"'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be"
34127,34128,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.587,HAMLET,But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
34128,34129,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.588,HAMLET,"To make oppression bitter, or ere this"
34129,34130,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.589,HAMLET,I should have fatted all the region kites
34130,34131,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.590,HAMLET,"With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!"
34131,34132,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.591,HAMLET,"Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!"
34132,34133,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.592,HAMLET,"O, vengeance!"
34133,34134,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.593,HAMLET,"Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,"
34134,34135,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.594,HAMLET,"That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,"
34135,34136,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.595,HAMLET,"Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,"
34136,34137,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.596,HAMLET,"Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,"
34137,34138,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.597,HAMLET,"And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,"
34138,34139,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.598,HAMLET,A scullion!
34139,34140,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.599,HAMLET,"Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard"
34140,34141,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.600,HAMLET,That guilty creatures sitting at a play
34141,34142,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.601,HAMLET,Have by the very cunning of the scene
34142,34143,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.602,HAMLET,Been struck so to the soul that presently
34143,34144,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.603,HAMLET,"They have proclaim'd their malefactions,"
34144,34145,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.604,HAMLET,"For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak"
34145,34146,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.605,HAMLET,With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
34146,34147,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.606,HAMLET,Play something like the murder of my father
34147,34148,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.607,HAMLET,"Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks,"
34148,34149,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.608,HAMLET,"I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,"
34149,34150,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.609,HAMLET,I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
34150,34151,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.610,HAMLET,May be the devil: and the devil hath power
34151,34152,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.611,HAMLET,"To assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps"
34152,34153,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.612,HAMLET,"Out of my weakness and my melancholy,"
34153,34154,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.613,HAMLET,"As he is very potent with such spirits,"
34154,34155,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.614,HAMLET,Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
34155,34156,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.615,HAMLET,More relative than this: the play 's the thing
34156,34157,Hamlet,165.0,2.2.616,HAMLET,Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

34160,34161,Hamlet,165.0,,HAMLET,"Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN"
34161,34162,Hamlet,1.0,3.1.1,KING CLAUDIUS,"And can you, by no drift of circumstance,"
34162,34163,Hamlet,1.0,3.1.2,KING CLAUDIUS,"Get from him why he puts on this confusion,"
34163,34164,Hamlet,1.0,3.1.3,KING CLAUDIUS,Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
34164,34165,Hamlet,1.0,3.1.4,KING CLAUDIUS,With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
34165,34166,Hamlet,2.0,3.1.5,ROSENCRANTZ,"He does confess he feels himself distracted,"
34166,34167,Hamlet,2.0,3.1.6,ROSENCRANTZ,But from what cause he will by no means speak.
34167,34168,Hamlet,3.0,3.1.7,GUILDENSTERN,"Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,"
34168,34169,Hamlet,3.0,3.1.8,GUILDENSTERN,"But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,"
34169,34170,Hamlet,3.0,3.1.9,GUILDENSTERN,When we would bring him on to some confession
34170,34171,Hamlet,3.0,3.1.10,GUILDENSTERN,Of his true state.
34171,34172,Hamlet,4.0,3.1.11,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Did he receive you well?
34172,34173,Hamlet,5.0,3.1.12,ROSENCRANTZ,Most like a gentleman.
34173,34174,Hamlet,6.0,3.1.13,GUILDENSTERN,But with much forcing of his disposition.
34174,34175,Hamlet,7.0,3.1.14,ROSENCRANTZ,"Niggard of question, but, of our demands,"
34175,34176,Hamlet,7.0,3.1.15,ROSENCRANTZ,Most free in his reply.
34176,34177,Hamlet,8.0,3.1.16,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Did you assay him?
34177,34178,Hamlet,8.0,3.1.17,QUEEN GERTRUDE,To any pastime?
34178,34179,Hamlet,9.0,3.1.18,ROSENCRANTZ,"Madam, it so fell out, that certain players"
34179,34180,Hamlet,9.0,3.1.19,ROSENCRANTZ,"We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,"
34180,34181,Hamlet,9.0,3.1.20,ROSENCRANTZ,And there did seem in him a kind of joy
34181,34182,Hamlet,9.0,3.1.21,ROSENCRANTZ,"To hear of it: they are about the court,"
34182,34183,Hamlet,9.0,3.1.22,ROSENCRANTZ,"And, as I think, they have already order"
34183,34184,Hamlet,9.0,3.1.23,ROSENCRANTZ,This night to play before him.
34184,34185,Hamlet,10.0,3.1.24,LORD POLONIUS,'Tis most true:
34185,34186,Hamlet,10.0,3.1.25,LORD POLONIUS,And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
34186,34187,Hamlet,10.0,3.1.26,LORD POLONIUS,To hear and see the matter.
34187,34188,Hamlet,11.0,3.1.27,KING CLAUDIUS,"With all my heart, and it doth much content me"
34188,34189,Hamlet,11.0,3.1.28,KING CLAUDIUS,To hear him so inclined.
34189,34190,Hamlet,11.0,3.1.29,KING CLAUDIUS,"Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,"
34190,34191,Hamlet,11.0,3.1.30,KING CLAUDIUS,And drive his purpose on to these delights.
34191,34192,Hamlet,12.0,3.1.31,ROSENCRANTZ,"We shall, my lord."
34192,34193,Hamlet,12.0,,ROSENCRANTZ,Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

34194,34195,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.33,KING CLAUDIUS,"For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,"

34196,34197,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.35,KING CLAUDIUS,Affront Ophelia:
34197,34198,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.36,KING CLAUDIUS,"Her father and myself, lawful espials,"
34198,34199,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.37,KING CLAUDIUS,"Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,"
34199,34200,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.38,KING CLAUDIUS,"We may of their encounter frankly judge,"
34200,34201,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.39,KING CLAUDIUS,"And gather by him, as he is behaved,"
34201,34202,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.40,KING CLAUDIUS,If 't be the affliction of his love or no
34202,34203,Hamlet,13.0,3.1.41,KING CLAUDIUS,That thus he suffers for.
34203,34204,Hamlet,14.0,3.1.42,QUEEN GERTRUDE,I shall obey you.
34204,34205,Hamlet,14.0,3.1.43,QUEEN GERTRUDE,"And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish"
34205,34206,Hamlet,14.0,3.1.44,QUEEN GERTRUDE,That your good beauties be the happy cause
34206,34207,Hamlet,14.0,3.1.45,QUEEN GERTRUDE,Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues

34208,34209,Hamlet,14.0,3.1.47,QUEEN GERTRUDE,To both your honours.
34209,34210,Hamlet,15.0,3.1.48,OPHELIA,"Madam, I wish it may."

34215,34216,Hamlet,16.0,3.1.52,LORD POLONIUS,That show of such an exercise may colour
34216,34217,Hamlet,16.0,3.1.53,LORD POLONIUS,"Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--"
34217,34218,Hamlet,16.0,3.1.54,LORD POLONIUS,'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
34218,34219,Hamlet,16.0,3.1.55,LORD POLONIUS,And pious action we do sugar o'er

34220,34221,Hamlet,17.0,3.1.57,KING CLAUDIUS,"[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!"
34221,34222,Hamlet,17.0,3.1.58,KING CLAUDIUS,How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
34222,34223,Hamlet,17.0,3.1.59,KING CLAUDIUS,"The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,"
34223,34224,Hamlet,17.0,3.1.60,KING CLAUDIUS,Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
34224,34225,Hamlet,17.0,3.1.61,KING CLAUDIUS,Than is my deed to my most painted word:
34225,34226,Hamlet,17.0,3.1.62,KING CLAUDIUS,O heavy burthen!
34226,34227,Hamlet,18.0,3.1.63,LORD POLONIUS,"I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord."

34230,34231,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.65,HAMLET,Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

34232,34233,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.67,HAMLET,"Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,"
34233,34234,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.68,HAMLET,"And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep,"
34234,34235,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.69,HAMLET,"No more, and by a sleep to say we end"
34235,34236,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.70,HAMLET,The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
34236,34237,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.71,HAMLET,"That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation"
34237,34238,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.72,HAMLET,"Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep,"

34239,34240,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.74,HAMLET,For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

34241,34242,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.76,HAMLET,Must give us pause: there's the respect
34242,34243,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.77,HAMLET,"That makes calamity of so long life,"
34243,34244,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.78,HAMLET,"For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,"
34244,34245,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.79,HAMLET,"The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,"
34245,34246,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.80,HAMLET,"The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,"

34248,34249,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.83,HAMLET,When he himself might his quietus make
34249,34250,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.84,HAMLET,"With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,"
34250,34251,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.85,HAMLET,"To grunt and sweat under a weary life,"
34251,34252,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.86,HAMLET,"But that the dread of something after death,"
34252,34253,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.87,HAMLET,The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
34253,34254,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.88,HAMLET,"No traveller returns, puzzles the will"
34254,34255,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.89,HAMLET,And makes us rather bear those ills we have
34255,34256,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.90,HAMLET,Than fly to others that we know not of?
34256,34257,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.91,HAMLET,"Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,"
34257,34258,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.92,HAMLET,And thus the native hue of resolution
34258,34259,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.93,HAMLET,"Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,"
34259,34260,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.94,HAMLET,And enterprises of great pith and moment
34260,34261,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.95,HAMLET,"With this regard their currents turn awry,"
34261,34262,Hamlet,19.0,3.1.96,HAMLET,And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!

34278,34279,Hamlet,25.0,3.1.113,HAMLET,"Ha, ha! are you honest?"
34279,34280,Hamlet,26.0,3.1.114,OPHELIA,My lord?
34280,34281,Hamlet,27.0,3.1.115,HAMLET,Are you fair?
34281,34282,Hamlet,28.0,3.1.116,OPHELIA,What means your lordship?

34287,34288,Hamlet,31.0,3.1.122,HAMLET,transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
34288,34289,Hamlet,31.0,3.1.123,HAMLET,force of honesty can translate beauty into his

34290,34291,Hamlet,31.0,3.1.125,HAMLET,time gives it proof. I did love you once.

34292,34293,Hamlet,33.0,3.1.127,HAMLET,"You should not have believed me, for virtue cannot"

35684,35685,Hamlet,1.0,4.7.4,KING CLAUDIUS,That he which hath your noble father slain
35685,35686,Hamlet,1.0,4.7.5,KING CLAUDIUS,Pursued my life.
35686,35687,Hamlet,2.0,4.7.6,LAERTES,It well appears: but tell me
35687,35688,Hamlet,2.0,4.7.7,LAERTES,"Why you proceeded not against these feats,"
35688,35689,Hamlet,2.0,4.7.8,LAERTES,"So crimeful and so capital in nature,"

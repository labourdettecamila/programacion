107908,107909,A Winters Tale,52.0,,VALENTINE,SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.
107909,107910,A Winters Tale,52.0,,VALENTINE,Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS
107910,107911,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.1.1,ARCHIDAMUS,"If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on"
107911,107912,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.1.2,ARCHIDAMUS,the like occasion whereon my services are now on
107912,107913,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.1.3,ARCHIDAMUS,"foot, you shall see, as I have said, great"
107913,107914,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.1.4,ARCHIDAMUS,difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
107914,107915,A Winters Tale,2.0,1.1.5,CAMILLO,"I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia"
107915,107916,A Winters Tale,2.0,1.1.6,CAMILLO,means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
107916,107917,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.1.7,ARCHIDAMUS,Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
107917,107918,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.1.8,ARCHIDAMUS,"justified in our loves, for indeed--"
107918,107919,A Winters Tale,4.0,1.1.9,CAMILLO,"Beseech you,--"
107919,107920,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.10,ARCHIDAMUS,"Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:"
107920,107921,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.11,ARCHIDAMUS,we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
107921,107922,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.12,ARCHIDAMUS,"not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,"
107922,107923,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.13,ARCHIDAMUS,"that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,"
107923,107924,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.14,ARCHIDAMUS,"may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse"
107924,107925,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.1.15,ARCHIDAMUS,us.
107925,107926,A Winters Tale,6.0,1.1.16,CAMILLO,You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
107926,107927,A Winters Tale,7.0,1.1.17,ARCHIDAMUS,"Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me"
107927,107928,A Winters Tale,7.0,1.1.18,ARCHIDAMUS,and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
107928,107929,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.19,CAMILLO,Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
107929,107930,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.20,CAMILLO,"They were trained together in their childhoods, and"
107930,107931,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.21,CAMILLO,"there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,"
107931,107932,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.22,CAMILLO,which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
107932,107933,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.23,CAMILLO,more mature dignities and royal necessities made
107933,107934,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.24,CAMILLO,"separation of their society, their encounters,"
107934,107935,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.25,CAMILLO,"though not personal, have been royally attorneyed"
107935,107936,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.26,CAMILLO,"with interchange of gifts, letters, loving"
107936,107937,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.27,CAMILLO,"embassies, that they have seemed to be together,"
107937,107938,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.28,CAMILLO,"though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and"
107938,107939,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.29,CAMILLO,"embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed"
107939,107940,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.1.30,CAMILLO,winds. The heavens continue their loves!
107940,107941,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.31,ARCHIDAMUS,I think there is not in the world either malice or
107941,107942,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.32,ARCHIDAMUS,matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
107942,107943,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.33,ARCHIDAMUS,comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
107943,107944,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.34,ARCHIDAMUS,gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
107944,107945,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.1.35,ARCHIDAMUS,into my note.
107945,107946,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.1.36,CAMILLO,I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
107946,107947,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.1.37,CAMILLO,"is a gallant child, one that indeed physics the"
107947,107948,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.1.38,CAMILLO,"subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on"
107948,107949,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.1.39,CAMILLO,crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
107949,107950,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.1.40,CAMILLO,see him a man.
107950,107951,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.1.41,ARCHIDAMUS,Would they else be content to die?
107951,107952,A Winters Tale,12.0,1.1.42,CAMILLO,"Yes, if there were no other excuse why they should"
107952,107953,A Winters Tale,12.0,1.1.43,CAMILLO,desire to live.
107953,107954,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.1.44,ARCHIDAMUS,"If the king had no son, they would desire to live"
107954,107955,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.1.45,ARCHIDAMUS,on crutches till he had one.
107955,107956,A Winters Tale,13.0,,ARCHIDAMUS,Exeunt
107956,107957,A Winters Tale,13.0,,ARCHIDAMUS,SCENE II. A room of state in the same.
107957,107958,A Winters Tale,13.0,,ARCHIDAMUS,"Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants"
107958,107959,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.1,POLIXENES,Nine changes of the watery star hath been
107959,107960,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.2,POLIXENES,The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
107960,107961,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.3,POLIXENES,Without a burthen: time as long again
107961,107962,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.4,POLIXENES,"Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks,"
107962,107963,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.5,POLIXENES,"And yet we should, for perpetuity,"
107963,107964,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.6,POLIXENES,"Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,"
107964,107965,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.7,POLIXENES,"Yet standing in rich place, I multiply"
107965,107966,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.8,POLIXENES,With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
107966,107967,A Winters Tale,1.0,1.2.9,POLIXENES,That go before it.
107967,107968,A Winters Tale,2.0,1.2.10,LEONTES,"Stay your thanks a while,"
107968,107969,A Winters Tale,2.0,1.2.11,LEONTES,And pay them when you part.
107969,107970,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.2.12,POLIXENES,"Sir, that's to-morrow."
107970,107971,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.2.13,POLIXENES,"I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance"
107971,107972,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.2.14,POLIXENES,"Or breed upon our absence, that may blow"
107972,107973,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.2.15,POLIXENES,"No sneaping winds at home, to make us say"
107973,107974,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.2.16,POLIXENES,"'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd"
107974,107975,A Winters Tale,3.0,1.2.17,POLIXENES,To tire your royalty.
107975,107976,A Winters Tale,4.0,1.2.18,LEONTES,"We are tougher, brother,"
107976,107977,A Winters Tale,4.0,1.2.19,LEONTES,Than you can put us to't.
107977,107978,A Winters Tale,5.0,1.2.20,POLIXENES,No longer stay.
107978,107979,A Winters Tale,6.0,1.2.21,LEONTES,One seven-night longer.
107979,107980,A Winters Tale,7.0,1.2.22,POLIXENES,"Very sooth, to-morrow."
107980,107981,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.2.23,LEONTES,"We'll part the time between's then, and in that"
107981,107982,A Winters Tale,8.0,1.2.24,LEONTES,I'll no gainsaying.
107982,107983,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.25,POLIXENES,"Press me not, beseech you, so."
107983,107984,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.26,POLIXENES,"There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,"
107984,107985,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.27,POLIXENES,"So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,"
107985,107986,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.28,POLIXENES,"Were there necessity in your request, although"
107986,107987,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.29,POLIXENES,'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
107987,107988,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.30,POLIXENES,Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
107988,107989,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.31,POLIXENES,"Were in your love a whip to me, my stay"
107989,107990,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.32,POLIXENES,"To you a charge and trouble: to save both,"
107990,107991,A Winters Tale,9.0,1.2.33,POLIXENES,"Farewell, our brother."
107991,107992,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.2.34,LEONTES,"Tongue-tied, our queen?"
107992,107993,A Winters Tale,10.0,1.2.35,LEONTES,speak you.
107993,107994,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.2.36,HERMIONE,"I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until"
107994,107995,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.2.37,HERMIONE,"You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,"
107995,107996,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.2.38,HERMIONE,"Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure"
107996,107997,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.2.39,HERMIONE,"All in Bohemia's well, this satisfaction"
107997,107998,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.2.40,HERMIONE,"The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,"
107998,107999,A Winters Tale,11.0,1.2.41,HERMIONE,He's beat from his best ward.
107999,108000,A Winters Tale,12.0,1.2.42,LEONTES,"Well said, Hermione."
108000,108001,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.43,HERMIONE,"To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:"
108001,108002,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.44,HERMIONE,"But let him say so then, and let him go,"
108002,108003,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.45,HERMIONE,"But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,"
108003,108004,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.46,HERMIONE,We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
108004,108005,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.47,HERMIONE,Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
108005,108006,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.48,HERMIONE,The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
108006,108007,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.49,HERMIONE,"You take my lord, I'll give him my commission"
108007,108008,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.50,HERMIONE,To let him there a month behind the gest
108008,108009,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.51,HERMIONE,"Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,"
108009,108010,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.52,HERMIONE,I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
108010,108011,A Winters Tale,13.0,1.2.53,HERMIONE,What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
108011,108012,A Winters Tale,14.0,1.2.54,POLIXENES,"No, madam."
108012,108013,A Winters Tale,15.0,1.2.55,HERMIONE,"Nay, but you will?"
108013,108014,A Winters Tale,16.0,1.2.56,POLIXENES,"I may not, verily."
108014,108015,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.57,HERMIONE,Verily!
108015,108016,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.58,HERMIONE,"You put me off with limber vows, but I,"
108016,108017,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.59,HERMIONE,Though you would seek to unsphere the
108017,108018,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.60,HERMIONE,"stars with oaths,"
108018,108019,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.61,HERMIONE,"Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,"
108019,108020,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.62,HERMIONE,You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
108020,108021,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.63,HERMIONE,As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
108021,108022,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.64,HERMIONE,"Force me to keep you as a prisoner,"
108022,108023,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.65,HERMIONE,"Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees"
108023,108024,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.66,HERMIONE,"When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?"
108024,108025,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.67,HERMIONE,"My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'"
108025,108026,A Winters Tale,17.0,1.2.68,HERMIONE,One of them you shall be.
108026,108027,A Winters Tale,18.0,1.2.69,POLIXENES,"Your guest, then, madam:"
108027,108028,A Winters Tale,18.0,1.2.70,POLIXENES,"To be your prisoner should import offending,"
108028,108029,A Winters Tale,18.0,1.2.71,POLIXENES,Which is for me less easy to commit
108029,108030,A Winters Tale,18.0,1.2.72,POLIXENES,Than you to punish.
108030,108031,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.73,HERMIONE,"Not your gaoler, then,"
108031,108032,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.74,HERMIONE,"But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you"
108032,108033,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.75,HERMIONE,Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
108033,108034,A Winters Tale,19.0,1.2.76,HERMIONE,You were pretty lordings then?
108034,108035,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.77,POLIXENES,"We were, fair queen,"
108035,108036,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.78,POLIXENES,Two lads that thought there was no more behind
108036,108037,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.79,POLIXENES,"But such a day to-morrow as to-day,"
108037,108038,A Winters Tale,20.0,1.2.80,POLIXENES,And to be boy eternal.
108038,108039,A Winters Tale,21.0,1.2.81,HERMIONE,Was not my lord
108039,108040,A Winters Tale,21.0,1.2.82,HERMIONE,The verier wag o' the two?
108040,108041,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.83,POLIXENES,"We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,"
108041,108042,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.84,POLIXENES,And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
108042,108043,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.85,POLIXENES,"Was innocence for innocence, we knew not"
108043,108044,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.86,POLIXENES,"The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd"
108044,108045,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.87,POLIXENES,"That any did. Had we pursued that life,"
108045,108046,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.88,POLIXENES,And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
108046,108047,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.89,POLIXENES,"With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven"
108047,108048,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.90,POLIXENES,"Boldly 'not guilty,' the imposition clear'd"
108048,108049,A Winters Tale,22.0,1.2.91,POLIXENES,Hereditary ours.
108049,108050,A Winters Tale,23.0,1.2.92,HERMIONE,By this we gather
108050,108051,A Winters Tale,23.0,1.2.93,HERMIONE,You have tripp'd since.
108051,108052,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.94,POLIXENES,O my most sacred lady!
108052,108053,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.95,POLIXENES,"Temptations have since then been born to's, for"
108053,108054,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.96,POLIXENES,"In those unfledged days was my wife a girl,"
108054,108055,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.97,POLIXENES,Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
108055,108056,A Winters Tale,24.0,1.2.98,POLIXENES,Of my young play-fellow.
108056,108057,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.99,HERMIONE,Grace to boot!
108057,108058,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.100,HERMIONE,"Of this make no conclusion, lest you say"
108058,108059,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.101,HERMIONE,"Your queen and I are devils: yet go on,"
108059,108060,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.102,HERMIONE,"The offences we have made you do we'll answer,"
108060,108061,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.103,HERMIONE,If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
108061,108062,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.104,HERMIONE,You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
108062,108063,A Winters Tale,25.0,1.2.105,HERMIONE,With any but with us.
108063,108064,A Winters Tale,26.0,1.2.106,LEONTES,Is he won yet?
108064,108065,A Winters Tale,27.0,1.2.107,HERMIONE,He'll stay my lord.
108065,108066,A Winters Tale,28.0,1.2.108,LEONTES,At my request he would not.
108066,108067,A Winters Tale,28.0,1.2.109,LEONTES,"Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest"
108067,108068,A Winters Tale,28.0,1.2.110,LEONTES,To better purpose.
108068,108069,A Winters Tale,29.0,1.2.111,HERMIONE,Never?
108069,108070,A Winters Tale,30.0,1.2.112,LEONTES,"Never, but once."
108070,108071,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.113,HERMIONE,What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
108071,108072,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.114,HERMIONE,"I prithee tell me, cram's with praise, and make's"
108072,108073,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.115,HERMIONE,As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
108073,108074,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.116,HERMIONE,Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
108074,108075,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.117,HERMIONE,Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
108075,108076,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.118,HERMIONE,With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
108076,108077,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.119,HERMIONE,With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
108077,108078,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.120,HERMIONE,My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
108078,108079,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.121,HERMIONE,"What was my first? it has an elder sister,"
108079,108080,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.122,HERMIONE,"Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!"
108080,108081,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.123,HERMIONE,But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
108081,108082,A Winters Tale,31.0,1.2.124,HERMIONE,"Nay, let me have't, I long."
108082,108083,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.125,LEONTES,"Why, that was when"
108083,108084,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.126,LEONTES,"Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,"
108084,108085,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.127,LEONTES,Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
108085,108086,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.128,LEONTES,And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
108086,108087,A Winters Tale,32.0,1.2.129,LEONTES,'I am yours for ever.'
108087,108088,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.130,HERMIONE,'Tis grace indeed.
108088,108089,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.131,HERMIONE,"Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:"
108089,108090,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.132,HERMIONE,"The one for ever earn'd a royal husband,"
108090,108091,A Winters Tale,33.0,1.2.133,HERMIONE,The other for some while a friend.
108091,108092,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.134,LEONTES,"[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!"
108092,108093,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.135,LEONTES,To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
108093,108094,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.136,LEONTES,"I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances,"
108094,108095,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.137,LEONTES,"But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment"
108095,108096,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.138,LEONTES,"May a free face put on, derive a liberty"
108096,108097,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.139,LEONTES,"From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,"
108097,108098,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.140,LEONTES,"And well become the agent, 't may, I grant,"
108098,108099,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.141,LEONTES,"But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,"
108099,108100,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.142,LEONTES,"As now they are, and making practised smiles,"
108100,108101,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.143,LEONTES,"As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere"
108101,108102,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.144,LEONTES,"The mort o' the deer, O, that is entertainment"
108102,108103,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.145,LEONTES,"My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,"
108103,108104,A Winters Tale,34.0,1.2.146,LEONTES,Art thou my boy?
108104,108105,A Winters Tale,35.0,1.2.147,MAMILLIUS,"Ay, my good lord."
108105,108106,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.148,LEONTES,I' fecks!
108106,108107,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.149,LEONTES,"Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast"
108107,108108,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.150,LEONTES,smutch'd thy nose?
108108,108109,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.151,LEONTES,"They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,"
108109,108110,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.152,LEONTES,"We must be neat, not neat, but cleanly, captain:"
108110,108111,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.153,LEONTES,"And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf"
108111,108112,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.154,LEONTES,Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
108112,108113,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.155,LEONTES,"Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!"
108113,108114,A Winters Tale,36.0,1.2.156,LEONTES,Art thou my calf?
108114,108115,A Winters Tale,37.0,1.2.157,MAMILLIUS,"Yes, if you will, my lord."
108115,108116,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.158,LEONTES,"Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,"
108116,108117,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.159,LEONTES,To be full like me: yet they say we are
108117,108118,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.160,LEONTES,"Almost as like as eggs, women say so,"
108118,108119,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.161,LEONTES,That will say anything but were they false
108119,108120,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.162,LEONTES,"As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false"
108120,108121,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.163,LEONTES,As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
108121,108122,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.164,LEONTES,"No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true"
108122,108123,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.165,LEONTES,"To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,"
108123,108124,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.166,LEONTES,Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
108124,108125,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.167,LEONTES,Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
108125,108126,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.168,LEONTES,Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
108126,108127,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.169,LEONTES,"Thou dost make possible things not so held,"
108127,108128,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.170,LEONTES,"Communicatest with dreams,--how can this be?--"
108128,108129,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.171,LEONTES,"With what's unreal thou coactive art,"
108129,108130,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.172,LEONTES,And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
108130,108131,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.173,LEONTES,"Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost,"
108131,108132,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.174,LEONTES,"And that beyond commission, and I find it,"
108132,108133,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.175,LEONTES,And that to the infection of my brains
108133,108134,A Winters Tale,38.0,1.2.176,LEONTES,And hardening of my brows.
108134,108135,A Winters Tale,39.0,1.2.177,POLIXENES,What means Sicilia?
108135,108136,A Winters Tale,40.0,1.2.178,HERMIONE,He something seems unsettled.
108136,108137,A Winters Tale,41.0,1.2.179,POLIXENES,"How, my lord!"
108137,108138,A Winters Tale,41.0,1.2.180,POLIXENES,"What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?"
108138,108139,A Winters Tale,42.0,1.2.181,HERMIONE,You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
108139,108140,A Winters Tale,42.0,1.2.182,HERMIONE,"Are you moved, my lord?"
108140,108141,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.183,LEONTES,"No, in good earnest."
108141,108142,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.184,LEONTES,"How sometimes nature will betray its folly,"
108142,108143,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.185,LEONTES,"Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime"
108143,108144,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.186,LEONTES,To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
108144,108145,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.187,LEONTES,"Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil"
108145,108146,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.188,LEONTES,"Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,"
108146,108147,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.189,LEONTES,"In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,"
108147,108148,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.190,LEONTES,"Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,"
108148,108149,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.191,LEONTES,"As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:"
108149,108150,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.192,LEONTES,"How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,"
108150,108151,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.193,LEONTES,"This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,"
108151,108152,A Winters Tale,43.0,1.2.194,LEONTES,Will you take eggs for money?
108152,108153,A Winters Tale,44.0,1.2.195,MAMILLIUS,"No, my lord, I'll fight."
108153,108154,A Winters Tale,45.0,1.2.196,LEONTES,"You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,"
108154,108155,A Winters Tale,45.0,1.2.197,LEONTES,Are you so fond of your young prince as we
108155,108156,A Winters Tale,45.0,1.2.198,LEONTES,Do seem to be of ours?
108156,108157,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.199,POLIXENES,"If at home, sir,"
108157,108158,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.200,POLIXENES,"He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,"
108158,108159,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.201,POLIXENES,"Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,"
108159,108160,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.202,POLIXENES,"My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:"
108160,108161,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.203,POLIXENES,"He makes a July's day short as December,"
108161,108162,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.204,POLIXENES,And with his varying childness cures in me
108162,108163,A Winters Tale,46.0,1.2.205,POLIXENES,Thoughts that would thick my blood.
108163,108164,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.206,LEONTES,So stands this squire
108164,108165,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.207,LEONTES,"Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,"
108165,108166,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.208,LEONTES,"And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,"
108166,108167,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.209,LEONTES,"How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome,"
108167,108168,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.210,LEONTES,Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
108168,108169,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.211,LEONTES,"Next to thyself and my young rover, he's"
108169,108170,A Winters Tale,47.0,1.2.212,LEONTES,Apparent to my heart.
108170,108171,A Winters Tale,48.0,1.2.213,HERMIONE,"If you would seek us,"
108171,108172,A Winters Tale,48.0,1.2.214,HERMIONE,We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
108172,108173,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.215,LEONTES,"To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,"
108173,108174,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.216,LEONTES,Be you beneath the sky.
108174,108175,A Winters Tale,49.0,,LEONTES,Aside
108175,108176,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.217,LEONTES,"I am angling now,"
108176,108177,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.218,LEONTES,Though you perceive me not how I give line.
108177,108178,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.219,LEONTES,"Go to, go to!"
108178,108179,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.220,LEONTES,"How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!"
108179,108180,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.221,LEONTES,And arms her with the boldness of a wife
108180,108181,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.222,LEONTES,To her allowing husband!
108181,108182,A Winters Tale,49.0,,LEONTES,"Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants"
108182,108183,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.223,LEONTES,Gone already!
108183,108184,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.224,LEONTES,"Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and"
108184,108185,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.225,LEONTES,ears a fork'd one!
108185,108186,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.226,LEONTES,"Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I"
108186,108187,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.227,LEONTES,"Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue"
108187,108188,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.228,LEONTES,Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
108188,108189,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.229,LEONTES,"Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play."
108189,108190,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.230,LEONTES,"There have been,"
108190,108191,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.231,LEONTES,"Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now,"
108191,108192,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.232,LEONTES,"And many a man there is, even at this present,"
108192,108193,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.233,LEONTES,"Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,"
108193,108194,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.234,LEONTES,That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
108194,108195,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.235,LEONTES,"And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by"
108195,108196,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.236,LEONTES,"Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't"
108196,108197,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.237,LEONTES,"Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,"
108197,108198,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.238,LEONTES,"As mine, against their will. Should all despair"
108198,108199,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.239,LEONTES,"That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind"
108199,108200,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.240,LEONTES,"Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none,"
108200,108201,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.241,LEONTES,"It is a bawdy planet, that will strike"
108201,108202,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.242,LEONTES,"Where 'tis predominant, and 'tis powerful, think it,"
108202,108203,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.243,LEONTES,"From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,"
108203,108204,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.244,LEONTES,"No barricado for a belly, know't,"
108204,108205,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.245,LEONTES,It will let in and out the enemy
108205,108206,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.246,LEONTES,With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
108206,108207,A Winters Tale,49.0,1.2.247,LEONTES,"Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!"
108207,108208,A Winters Tale,50.0,1.2.248,MAMILLIUS,"I am like you, they say."
108208,108209,A Winters Tale,51.0,1.2.249,LEONTES,"Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?"
108209,108210,A Winters Tale,52.0,1.2.250,CAMILLO,"Ay, my good lord."
108210,108211,A Winters Tale,53.0,1.2.251,LEONTES,"Go play, Mamillius, thou'rt an honest man."
108211,108212,A Winters Tale,53.0,,LEONTES,Exit MAMILLIUS
108212,108213,A Winters Tale,53.0,1.2.252,LEONTES,"Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer."
108213,108214,A Winters Tale,54.0,1.2.253,CAMILLO,You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
108214,108215,A Winters Tale,54.0,1.2.254,CAMILLO,"When you cast out, it still came home."
108215,108216,A Winters Tale,55.0,1.2.255,LEONTES,Didst note it?
108216,108217,A Winters Tale,56.0,1.2.256,CAMILLO,He would not stay at your petitions: made
108217,108218,A Winters Tale,56.0,1.2.257,CAMILLO,His business more material.
108218,108219,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.258,LEONTES,Didst perceive it?
108219,108220,A Winters Tale,57.0,,LEONTES,Aside
108220,108221,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.259,LEONTES,"They're here with me already, whispering, rounding"
108221,108222,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.260,LEONTES,"'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,"
108222,108223,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.261,LEONTES,"When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,"
108223,108224,A Winters Tale,57.0,1.2.262,LEONTES,That he did stay?
108224,108225,A Winters Tale,58.0,1.2.263,CAMILLO,At the good queen's entreaty.
108225,108226,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.264,LEONTES,At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
108226,108227,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.265,LEONTES,"But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken"
108227,108228,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.266,LEONTES,By any understanding pate but thine?
108228,108229,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.267,LEONTES,"For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in"
108229,108230,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.268,LEONTES,"More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,"
108230,108231,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.269,LEONTES,But of the finer natures? by some severals
108231,108232,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.270,LEONTES,Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
108232,108233,A Winters Tale,59.0,1.2.271,LEONTES,Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
108233,108234,A Winters Tale,60.0,1.2.272,CAMILLO,"Business, my lord! I think most understand"
108234,108235,A Winters Tale,60.0,1.2.273,CAMILLO,Bohemia stays here longer.
108235,108236,A Winters Tale,61.0,1.2.274,LEONTES,Ha!
108236,108237,A Winters Tale,62.0,1.2.275,CAMILLO,Stays here longer.
108237,108238,A Winters Tale,63.0,1.2.276,LEONTES,"Ay, but why?"
108238,108239,A Winters Tale,64.0,1.2.277,CAMILLO,To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
108239,108240,A Winters Tale,64.0,1.2.278,CAMILLO,Of our most gracious mistress.
108240,108241,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.279,LEONTES,Satisfy!
108241,108242,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.280,LEONTES,The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
108242,108243,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.281,LEONTES,"Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,"
108243,108244,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.282,LEONTES,"With all the nearest things to my heart, as well"
108244,108245,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.283,LEONTES,"My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou"
108245,108246,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.284,LEONTES,"Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed"
108246,108247,A Winters Tale,65.0,1.2.285,LEONTES,Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been

108367,108368,A Winters Tale,83.0,1.2.406,LEONTES,This is all:

108374,108375,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.412,CAMILLO,What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
108375,108376,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.413,CAMILLO,"Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do't"

108380,108381,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.418,CAMILLO,Of thousands that had struck anointed kings

108386,108387,A Winters Tale,86.0,1.2.424,CAMILLO,Here comes Bohemia.

108388,108389,A Winters Tale,87.0,1.2.425,POLIXENES,This is strange: methinks
108389,108390,A Winters Tale,87.0,1.2.426,POLIXENES,My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
108390,108391,A Winters Tale,87.0,1.2.427,POLIXENES,"Good day, Camillo."
108391,108392,A Winters Tale,88.0,1.2.428,CAMILLO,"Hail, most royal sir!"
108392,108393,A Winters Tale,89.0,1.2.429,POLIXENES,What is the news i' the court?
108393,108394,A Winters Tale,90.0,1.2.430,CAMILLO,"None rare, my lord."
108394,108395,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.431,POLIXENES,The king hath on him such a countenance
108395,108396,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.432,POLIXENES,As he had lost some province and a region
108396,108397,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.433,POLIXENES,Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
108397,108398,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.434,POLIXENES,"With customary compliment, when he,"
108398,108399,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.435,POLIXENES,Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
108399,108400,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.436,POLIXENES,"A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and"
108400,108401,A Winters Tale,91.0,1.2.437,POLIXENES,So leaves me to consider what is breeding

108402,108403,A Winters Tale,92.0,1.2.439,CAMILLO,"I dare not know, my lord."
108403,108404,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.440,POLIXENES,"How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?"
108404,108405,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.441,POLIXENES,"Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts,"
108405,108406,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.442,POLIXENES,"For, to yourself, what you do know, you must."
108406,108407,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.443,POLIXENES,"And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,"
108407,108408,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.444,POLIXENES,Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
108408,108409,A Winters Tale,93.0,1.2.445,POLIXENES,"Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be"

108411,108412,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.448,CAMILLO,There is a sickness
108412,108413,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.449,CAMILLO,"Which puts some of us in distemper, but"
108413,108414,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.450,CAMILLO,"I cannot name the disease, and it is caught"
108414,108415,A Winters Tale,94.0,1.2.451,CAMILLO,Of you that yet are well.
108415,108416,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.452,POLIXENES,How! caught of me!
108416,108417,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.453,POLIXENES,Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
108417,108418,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.454,POLIXENES,"I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better"
108418,108419,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.455,POLIXENES,"By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--"
108419,108420,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.456,POLIXENES,"As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto"
108420,108421,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.457,POLIXENES,"Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns"
108421,108422,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.458,POLIXENES,"Our gentry than our parents' noble names,"
108422,108423,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.459,POLIXENES,"In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,"
108423,108424,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.460,POLIXENES,If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
108424,108425,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.461,POLIXENES,"Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not"
108425,108426,A Winters Tale,95.0,1.2.462,POLIXENES,In ignorant concealment.
108426,108427,A Winters Tale,96.0,1.2.463,CAMILLO,I may not answer.
108427,108428,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.464,POLIXENES,"A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!"
108428,108429,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.465,POLIXENES,"I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,"
108429,108430,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.466,POLIXENES,"I conjure thee, by all the parts of man"
108430,108431,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.467,POLIXENES,"Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least"
108431,108432,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.468,POLIXENES,"Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare"
108432,108433,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.469,POLIXENES,What incidency thou dost guess of harm
108433,108434,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.470,POLIXENES,"Is creeping toward me, how far off, how near,"
108434,108435,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.471,POLIXENES,"Which way to be prevented, if to be,"
108435,108436,A Winters Tale,97.0,1.2.472,POLIXENES,"If not, how best to bear it."
108436,108437,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.473,CAMILLO,"Sir, I will tell you,"
108437,108438,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.474,CAMILLO,Since I am charged in honour and by him
108438,108439,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.475,CAMILLO,"That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,"
108439,108440,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.476,CAMILLO,Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
108440,108441,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.477,CAMILLO,"I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me"
108441,108442,A Winters Tale,98.0,1.2.478,CAMILLO,"Cry lost, and so good night!"
108442,108443,A Winters Tale,99.0,1.2.479,POLIXENES,"On, good Camillo."
108443,108444,A Winters Tale,100.0,1.2.480,CAMILLO,I am appointed him to murder you.
108444,108445,A Winters Tale,101.0,1.2.481,POLIXENES,"By whom, Camillo?"
108445,108446,A Winters Tale,102.0,1.2.482,CAMILLO,By the king.
108446,108447,A Winters Tale,103.0,1.2.483,POLIXENES,For what?
108447,108448,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.484,CAMILLO,"He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,"
108448,108449,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.485,CAMILLO,As he had seen't or been an instrument
108449,108450,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.486,CAMILLO,"To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen"
108450,108451,A Winters Tale,104.0,1.2.487,CAMILLO,Forbiddenly.
108451,108452,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.488,POLIXENES,"O, then my best blood turn"
108452,108453,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.489,POLIXENES,To an infected jelly and my name
108453,108454,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.490,POLIXENES,Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
108454,108455,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.491,POLIXENES,Turn then my freshest reputation to
108455,108456,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.492,POLIXENES,A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
108456,108457,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.493,POLIXENES,"Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,"
108457,108458,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.494,POLIXENES,"Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection"
108458,108459,A Winters Tale,105.0,1.2.495,POLIXENES,That e'er was heard or read!
108459,108460,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.496,CAMILLO,Swear his thought over
108460,108461,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.497,CAMILLO,By each particular star in heaven and
108461,108462,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.498,CAMILLO,"By all their influences, you may as well"
108462,108463,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.499,CAMILLO,Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
108463,108464,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.500,CAMILLO,As or by oath remove or counsel shake
108464,108465,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.501,CAMILLO,"The fabric of his folly, whose foundation"
108465,108466,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.502,CAMILLO,Is piled upon his faith and will continue
108466,108467,A Winters Tale,106.0,1.2.503,CAMILLO,The standing of his body.
108467,108468,A Winters Tale,107.0,1.2.504,POLIXENES,How should this grow?
108468,108469,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.505,CAMILLO,I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
108469,108470,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.506,CAMILLO,Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
108470,108471,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.507,CAMILLO,"If therefore you dare trust my honesty,"
108471,108472,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.508,CAMILLO,That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
108472,108473,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.509,CAMILLO,"Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!"
108473,108474,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.510,CAMILLO,"Your followers I will whisper to the business,"
108474,108475,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.511,CAMILLO,And will by twos and threes at several posterns
108475,108476,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.512,CAMILLO,"Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put"
108476,108477,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.513,CAMILLO,"My fortunes to your service, which are here"
108477,108478,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.514,CAMILLO,"By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,"
108478,108479,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.515,CAMILLO,"For, by the honour of my parents, I"
108479,108480,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.516,CAMILLO,"Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,"
108480,108481,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.517,CAMILLO,"I dare not stand by, nor shall you be safer"
108481,108482,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.518,CAMILLO,"Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon"
108482,108483,A Winters Tale,108.0,1.2.519,CAMILLO,His execution sworn.
108483,108484,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.520,POLIXENES,I do believe thee:
108484,108485,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.521,POLIXENES,I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
108485,108486,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.522,POLIXENES,Be pilot to me and thy places shall
108486,108487,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.523,POLIXENES,Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
108487,108488,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.524,POLIXENES,My people did expect my hence departure
108488,108489,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.525,POLIXENES,Two days ago. This jealousy
108489,108490,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.526,POLIXENES,"Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,"
108490,108491,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.527,POLIXENES,"Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,"
108491,108492,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.528,POLIXENES,"Must it be violent, and as he does conceive"
108492,108493,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.529,POLIXENES,He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
108493,108494,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.530,POLIXENES,"Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must"
108494,108495,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.531,POLIXENES,In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
108495,108496,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.532,POLIXENES,"Good expedition be my friend, and comfort"
108496,108497,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.533,POLIXENES,"The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing"
108497,108498,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.534,POLIXENES,"Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo,"
108498,108499,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.535,POLIXENES,I will respect thee as a father if
108499,108500,A Winters Tale,109.0,1.2.536,POLIXENES,Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
108500,108501,A Winters Tale,110.0,1.2.537,CAMILLO,It is in mine authority to command
108501,108502,A Winters Tale,110.0,1.2.538,CAMILLO,The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
108502,108503,A Winters Tale,110.0,1.2.539,CAMILLO,"To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away."
108503,108504,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,Exeunt
108504,108505,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,ACT II
108505,108506,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
108506,108507,A Winters Tale,110.0,,CAMILLO,"Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies"
108507,108508,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.1.1,HERMIONE,"Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,"
108508,108509,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.1.2,HERMIONE,'Tis past enduring.
108509,108510,A Winters Tale,2.0,2.1.3,First Lady,"Come, my gracious lord,"
108510,108511,A Winters Tale,2.0,2.1.4,First Lady,Shall I be your playfellow?
108511,108512,A Winters Tale,3.0,2.1.5,MAMILLIUS,"No, I'll none of you."
108512,108513,A Winters Tale,4.0,2.1.6,First Lady,"Why, my sweet lord?"
108513,108514,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.1.7,MAMILLIUS,You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
108514,108515,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.1.8,MAMILLIUS,I were a baby still. I love you better.
108515,108516,A Winters Tale,6.0,2.1.9,Second Lady,"And why so, my lord?"
108516,108517,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.10,MAMILLIUS,Not for because
108517,108518,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.11,MAMILLIUS,"Your brows are blacker, yet black brows, they say,"
108518,108519,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.12,MAMILLIUS,"Become some women best, so that there be not"
108519,108520,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.13,MAMILLIUS,"Too much hair there, but in a semicircle"
108520,108521,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.1.14,MAMILLIUS,Or a half-moon made with a pen.
108521,108522,A Winters Tale,8.0,2.1.15,Second Lady,Who taught you this?
108522,108523,A Winters Tale,9.0,2.1.16,MAMILLIUS,I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
108523,108524,A Winters Tale,9.0,2.1.17,MAMILLIUS,What colour are your eyebrows?
108524,108525,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.1.18,First Lady,"Blue, my lord."
108525,108526,A Winters Tale,11.0,2.1.19,MAMILLIUS,"Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose"
108526,108527,A Winters Tale,11.0,2.1.20,MAMILLIUS,"That has been blue, but not her eyebrows."
108527,108528,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.21,First Lady,"Hark ye,"
108528,108529,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.22,First Lady,The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
108529,108530,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.23,First Lady,Present our services to a fine new prince
108530,108531,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.24,First Lady,"One of these days, and then you'ld wanton with us,"
108531,108532,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.1.25,First Lady,If we would have you.
108532,108533,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.1.26,Second Lady,She is spread of late
108533,108534,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.1.27,Second Lady,Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
108534,108535,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.1.28,HERMIONE,"What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now"
108535,108536,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.1.29,HERMIONE,"I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,"
108536,108537,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.1.30,HERMIONE,And tell 's a tale.
108537,108538,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.1.31,MAMILLIUS,Merry or sad shall't be?
108538,108539,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.1.32,HERMIONE,As merry as you will.
108539,108540,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.1.33,MAMILLIUS,A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
108540,108541,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.1.34,MAMILLIUS,Of sprites and goblins.
108541,108542,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.1.35,HERMIONE,"Let's have that, good sir."
108542,108543,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.1.36,HERMIONE,"Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best"
108543,108544,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.1.37,HERMIONE,"To fright me with your sprites, you're powerful at it."
108544,108545,A Winters Tale,19.0,2.1.38,MAMILLIUS,There was a man--
108545,108546,A Winters Tale,20.0,2.1.39,HERMIONE,"Nay, come, sit down, then on."
108546,108547,A Winters Tale,21.0,2.1.40,MAMILLIUS,"Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly,"
108547,108548,A Winters Tale,21.0,2.1.41,MAMILLIUS,Yond crickets shall not hear it.
108548,108549,A Winters Tale,22.0,2.1.42,HERMIONE,"Come on, then,"
108549,108550,A Winters Tale,22.0,2.1.43,HERMIONE,And give't me in mine ear.
108550,108551,A Winters Tale,22.0,,HERMIONE,"Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others"
108551,108552,A Winters Tale,23.0,2.1.44,LEONTES,Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
108552,108553,A Winters Tale,24.0,2.1.45,First Lord,"Behind the tuft of pines I met them, never"
108553,108554,A Winters Tale,24.0,2.1.46,First Lord,Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
108554,108555,A Winters Tale,24.0,2.1.47,First Lord,Even to their ships.
108555,108556,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.48,LEONTES,How blest am I
108556,108557,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.49,LEONTES,"In my just censure, in my true opinion!"
108557,108558,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.50,LEONTES,"Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed"
108558,108559,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.51,LEONTES,In being so blest! There may be in the cup
108559,108560,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.52,LEONTES,"A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,"
108560,108561,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.53,LEONTES,"And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge"
108561,108562,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.54,LEONTES,Is not infected: but if one present
108562,108563,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.55,LEONTES,"The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known"
108563,108564,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.56,LEONTES,"How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,"
108564,108565,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.57,LEONTES,"With violent hefts. I have drunk,"
108565,108566,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.58,LEONTES,and seen the spider.
108566,108567,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.59,LEONTES,"Camillo was his help in this, his pander:"
108567,108568,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.60,LEONTES,"There is a plot against my life, my crown,"
108568,108569,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.61,LEONTES,All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
108569,108570,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.62,LEONTES,Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
108570,108571,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.63,LEONTES,"He has discover'd my design, and I"
108571,108572,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.64,LEONTES,"Remain a pinch'd thing, yea, a very trick"
108572,108573,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.65,LEONTES,For them to play at will. How came the posterns
108573,108574,A Winters Tale,25.0,2.1.66,LEONTES,So easily open?
108574,108575,A Winters Tale,26.0,2.1.67,First Lord,"By his great authority,"
108575,108576,A Winters Tale,26.0,2.1.68,First Lord,Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
108576,108577,A Winters Tale,26.0,2.1.69,First Lord,On your command.
108577,108578,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.70,LEONTES,I know't too well.
108578,108579,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.71,LEONTES,Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
108579,108580,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.72,LEONTES,"Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you"
108580,108581,A Winters Tale,27.0,2.1.73,LEONTES,Have too much blood in him.
108581,108582,A Winters Tale,28.0,2.1.74,HERMIONE,What is this? sport?
108582,108583,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.75,LEONTES,"Bear the boy hence, he shall not come about her,"
108583,108584,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.76,LEONTES,Away with him! and let her sport herself
108584,108585,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.77,LEONTES,"With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes"
108585,108586,A Winters Tale,29.0,2.1.78,LEONTES,Has made thee swell thus.
108586,108587,A Winters Tale,30.0,2.1.79,HERMIONE,"But I'ld say he had not,"

108784,108785,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.2.33,EMILIA,"Which never tender lady hath born greater,"
108785,108786,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.2.34,EMILIA,She is something before her time deliver'd.

108788,108789,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.2.37,EMILIA,Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
108789,108790,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.2.38,EMILIA,"Much comfort in't, says 'My poor prisoner,"
108790,108791,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.2.39,EMILIA,I am innocent as you.'

108802,108803,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.2.51,PAULINA,Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
108803,108804,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.2.52,PAULINA,How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
108804,108805,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.2.53,PAULINA,The silence often of pure innocence
108805,108806,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.2.54,PAULINA,Persuades when speaking fails.
108806,108807,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.2.55,EMILIA,"Most worthy madam,"
108807,108808,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.2.56,EMILIA,Your honour and your goodness is so evident

108816,108817,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.2.65,PAULINA,"Tell her, Emilia."
108817,108818,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.2.66,PAULINA,I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
108818,108819,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.2.67,PAULINA,"As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted"

108823,108824,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.2.72,Gaoler,"Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,"
108824,108825,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.2.73,Gaoler,"I know not what I shall incur to pass it,"
108825,108826,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.2.74,Gaoler,Having no warrant.
108826,108827,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.75,PAULINA,"You need not fear it, sir:"
108827,108828,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.76,PAULINA,This child was prisoner to the womb and is
108828,108829,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.77,PAULINA,By law and process of great nature thence
108829,108830,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.78,PAULINA,"Freed and enfranchised, not a party to"

108831,108832,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.2.80,PAULINA,"If any be, the trespass of the queen."
108832,108833,A Winters Tale,19.0,2.2.81,Gaoler,I do believe it.
108833,108834,A Winters Tale,20.0,2.2.82,PAULINA,"Do not you fear: upon mine honour,"

108839,108840,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.2,LEONTES,"To bear the matter thus, mere weakness. If"
108840,108841,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.3,LEONTES,"The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,"
108841,108842,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.4,LEONTES,"She the adulteress, for the harlot king"

108843,108844,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.6,LEONTES,"And level of my brain, plot-proof, but she"
108844,108845,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.7,LEONTES,"I can hook to me: say that she were gone,"
108845,108846,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.8,LEONTES,"Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest"
108846,108847,A Winters Tale,1.0,2.3.9,LEONTES,Might come to me again. Who's there?
108847,108848,A Winters Tale,2.0,2.3.10,First Servant,My lord?
108848,108849,A Winters Tale,3.0,2.3.11,LEONTES,How does the boy?
108849,108850,A Winters Tale,4.0,2.3.12,First Servant,"He took good rest to-night,"

108853,108854,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.16,LEONTES,"He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,"

108855,108856,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.18,LEONTES,"Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,"

108861,108862,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.23,LEONTES,"Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,"

108864,108865,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.26,LEONTES,Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
108865,108866,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.27,LEONTES,"Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:"
108866,108867,A Winters Tale,5.0,2.3.28,LEONTES,"They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor"

108872,108873,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.3.33,PAULINA,"Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,"
108873,108874,A Winters Tale,7.0,2.3.34,PAULINA,More free than he is jealous.
108874,108875,A Winters Tale,8.0,2.3.35,ANTIGONUS,That's enough.
108875,108876,A Winters Tale,9.0,2.3.36,Second Servant,"Madam, he hath not slept tonight, commanded"
108876,108877,A Winters Tale,9.0,2.3.37,Second Servant,None should come at him.
108877,108878,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.38,PAULINA,"Not so hot, good sir:"
108878,108879,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.39,PAULINA,"I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,"
108879,108880,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.40,PAULINA,That creep like shadows by him and do sigh

108881,108882,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.42,PAULINA,Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
108882,108883,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.43,PAULINA,"Do come with words as medicinal as true,"
108883,108884,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.44,PAULINA,"Honest as either, to purge him of that humour"
108884,108885,A Winters Tale,10.0,2.3.45,PAULINA,That presses him from sleep.
108885,108886,A Winters Tale,11.0,2.3.46,LEONTES,"What noise there, ho?"
108886,108887,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.3.47,PAULINA,"No noise, my lord, but needful conference"
108887,108888,A Winters Tale,12.0,2.3.48,PAULINA,About some gossips for your highness.
108888,108889,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.49,LEONTES,How!
108889,108890,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.50,LEONTES,"Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,"
108890,108891,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.51,LEONTES,I charged thee that she should not come about me:
108891,108892,A Winters Tale,13.0,2.3.52,LEONTES,I knew she would.
108892,108893,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.3.53,ANTIGONUS,"I told her so, my lord,"
108893,108894,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.3.54,ANTIGONUS,"On your displeasure's peril and on mine,"
108894,108895,A Winters Tale,14.0,2.3.55,ANTIGONUS,She should not visit you.
108895,108896,A Winters Tale,15.0,2.3.56,LEONTES,"What, canst not rule her?"
108896,108897,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.57,PAULINA,"From all dishonesty he can: in this,"
108897,108898,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.58,PAULINA,"Unless he take the course that you have done,"
108898,108899,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.59,PAULINA,"Commit me for committing honour, trust it,"
108899,108900,A Winters Tale,16.0,2.3.60,PAULINA,He shall not rule me.
108900,108901,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.3.61,ANTIGONUS,"La you now, you hear:"
108901,108902,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.3.62,ANTIGONUS,"When she will take the rein I let her run,"
108902,108903,A Winters Tale,17.0,2.3.63,ANTIGONUS,But she'll not stumble.
108903,108904,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.3.64,PAULINA,"Good my liege, I come,"
108904,108905,A Winters Tale,18.0,2.3.65,PAULINA,"And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess"

109183,109184,A Winters Tale,6.0,3.2.57,LEONTES,Less impudence to gainsay what they did
109184,109185,A Winters Tale,6.0,3.2.58,LEONTES,Than to perform it first.
109185,109186,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.2.59,HERMIONE,"That's true enough,"
109186,109187,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.2.60,HERMIONE,"Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me."

109202,109203,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.76,HERMIONE,For me to try how: all I know of it
109203,109204,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.77,HERMIONE,"Is that Camillo was an honest man,"
109204,109205,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.78,HERMIONE,"And why he left your court, the gods themselves,"
109205,109206,A Winters Tale,9.0,3.2.79,HERMIONE,"Wotting no more than I, are ignorant."
109206,109207,A Winters Tale,10.0,3.2.80,LEONTES,"You knew of his departure, as you know"

109213,109214,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.87,LEONTES,"You had a bastard by Polixenes,"
109214,109215,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.88,LEONTES,"And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--"
109215,109216,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.89,LEONTES,Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
109216,109217,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.90,LEONTES,"Which to deny concerns more than avails, for as"
109217,109218,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.91,LEONTES,"Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,"
109218,109219,A Winters Tale,12.0,3.2.92,LEONTES,"No father owning it,--which is, indeed,"

109223,109224,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.97,HERMIONE,The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
109224,109225,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.98,HERMIONE,To me can life be no commodity:

109228,109229,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.102,HERMIONE,"And first-fruits of my body, from his presence"
109229,109230,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.103,HERMIONE,"I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort"
109230,109231,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.104,HERMIONE,"Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,"
109231,109232,A Winters Tale,13.0,3.2.105,HERMIONE,"The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,"

109291,109292,A Winters Tale,32.0,3.2.161,PAULINA,This news is mortal to the queen: look down
109292,109293,A Winters Tale,32.0,3.2.162,PAULINA,And see what death is doing.
109293,109294,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.163,LEONTES,Take her hence:
109294,109295,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.164,LEONTES,"Her heart is but o'ercharged, she will recover:"
109295,109296,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.165,LEONTES,I have too much believed mine own suspicion:

109308,109309,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.177,LEONTES,But that the good mind of Camillo tardied

109310,109311,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.179,LEONTES,"Reward did threaten and encourage him,"
109311,109312,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.180,LEONTES,"Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane"

109316,109317,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.185,LEONTES,No richer than his honour: how he glisters
109317,109318,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.186,LEONTES,Thorough my rust! and how his pity
109318,109319,A Winters Tale,33.0,3.2.187,LEONTES,Does my deeds make the blacker!
109319,109320,A Winters Tale,33.0,,LEONTES,Re-enter PAULINA
109320,109321,A Winters Tale,34.0,3.2.188,PAULINA,Woe the while!
109321,109322,A Winters Tale,34.0,3.2.189,PAULINA,"O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,"
109322,109323,A Winters Tale,34.0,3.2.190,PAULINA,Break too.
109323,109324,A Winters Tale,35.0,3.2.191,First Lord,"What fit is this, good lady?"
109324,109325,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.192,PAULINA,"What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?"
109325,109326,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.193,PAULINA,What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
109326,109327,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.194,PAULINA,In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
109327,109328,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.195,PAULINA,"Must I receive, whose every word deserves"
109328,109329,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.196,PAULINA,To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny

109330,109331,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.198,PAULINA,"Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle"

109333,109334,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.201,PAULINA,Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
109334,109335,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.202,PAULINA,"That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing,"
109335,109336,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.203,PAULINA,"That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant"
109336,109337,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.204,PAULINA,"And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,"
109337,109338,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.205,PAULINA,"Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,"
109338,109339,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.206,PAULINA,"To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,"
109339,109340,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.207,PAULINA,More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
109340,109341,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.208,PAULINA,The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter

109342,109343,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.210,PAULINA,Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:

109344,109345,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.212,PAULINA,"Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,"
109345,109346,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.213,PAULINA,"Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart"
109346,109347,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.214,PAULINA,That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
109347,109348,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.215,PAULINA,"Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,"
109348,109349,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.216,PAULINA,"Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,"
109349,109350,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.217,PAULINA,"When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,"
109350,109351,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.218,PAULINA,"The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,"
109351,109352,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.219,PAULINA,and vengeance for't
109352,109353,A Winters Tale,36.0,3.2.220,PAULINA,Not dropp'd down yet.
109353,109354,A Winters Tale,37.0,3.2.221,First Lord,The higher powers forbid!
109354,109355,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.222,PAULINA,"I say she's dead, I'll swear't. If word nor oath"
109355,109356,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.223,PAULINA,"Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring"
109356,109357,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.224,PAULINA,"Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,"
109357,109358,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.225,PAULINA,"Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you"
109358,109359,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.226,PAULINA,"As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!"
109359,109360,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.227,PAULINA,"Do not repent these things, for they are heavier"
109360,109361,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.228,PAULINA,"Than all thy woes can stir, therefore betake thee"
109361,109362,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.229,PAULINA,To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
109362,109363,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.230,PAULINA,"Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,"
109363,109364,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.231,PAULINA,Upon a barren mountain and still winter
109364,109365,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.232,PAULINA,"In storm perpetual, could not move the gods"
109365,109366,A Winters Tale,38.0,3.2.233,PAULINA,To look that way thou wert.
109366,109367,A Winters Tale,39.0,3.2.234,LEONTES,"Go on, go on"
109367,109368,A Winters Tale,39.0,3.2.235,LEONTES,"Thou canst not speak too much, I have deserved"
109368,109369,A Winters Tale,39.0,3.2.236,LEONTES,All tongues to talk their bitterest.
109369,109370,A Winters Tale,40.0,3.2.237,First Lord,Say no more:
109370,109371,A Winters Tale,40.0,3.2.238,First Lord,"Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault"
109371,109372,A Winters Tale,40.0,3.2.239,First Lord,I' the boldness of your speech.
109372,109373,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.240,PAULINA,I am sorry for't:
109373,109374,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.241,PAULINA,"All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,"
109374,109375,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.242,PAULINA,I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
109375,109376,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.243,PAULINA,The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
109376,109377,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.244,PAULINA,To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
109377,109378,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.245,PAULINA,Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
109378,109379,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.246,PAULINA,"At my petition, I beseech you, rather"
109379,109380,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.247,PAULINA,"Let me be punish'd, that have minded you"
109380,109381,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.248,PAULINA,"Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege"

109384,109385,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.252,PAULINA,"I'll not remember you of my own lord,"
109385,109386,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.253,PAULINA,"Who is lost too: take your patience to you,"
109386,109387,A Winters Tale,41.0,3.2.254,PAULINA,And I'll say nothing.
109387,109388,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.255,LEONTES,Thou didst speak but well
109388,109389,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.256,LEONTES,"When most the truth, which I receive much better"
109389,109390,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.257,LEONTES,"Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me"
109390,109391,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.258,LEONTES,To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
109391,109392,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.259,LEONTES,One grave shall be for both: upon them shall

109393,109394,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.261,LEONTES,Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
109394,109395,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.262,LEONTES,"The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there"
109395,109396,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.263,LEONTES,Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
109396,109397,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.264,LEONTES,"Will bear up with this exercise, so long"
109397,109398,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.265,LEONTES,I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
109398,109399,A Winters Tale,42.0,3.2.266,LEONTES,Unto these sorrows.

109404,109405,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.3,Mariner,"Ay, my lord: and fear"
109405,109406,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.4,Mariner,We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly

109407,109408,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.6,Mariner,The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
109408,109409,A Winters Tale,2.0,3.3.7,Mariner,And frown upon 's.

109426,109427,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.24,ANTIGONUS,"So like a waking. To me comes a creature,"
109427,109428,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.25,ANTIGONUS,"Sometimes her head on one side, some another,"
109428,109429,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.26,ANTIGONUS,"I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,"
109429,109430,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.27,ANTIGONUS,"So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,"
109430,109431,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.28,ANTIGONUS,"Like very sanctity, she did approach"

109444,109445,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.42,ANTIGONUS,"She melted into air. Affrighted much,"
109445,109446,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.43,ANTIGONUS,I did in time collect myself and thought
109446,109447,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.44,ANTIGONUS,This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
109447,109448,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.45,ANTIGONUS,"Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,"
109448,109449,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.46,ANTIGONUS,I will be squared by this. I do believe

109453,109454,A Winters Tale,7.0,3.3.51,ANTIGONUS,"Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!"

109801,109802,A Winters Tale,4.0,4.4.26,PERDITA,"Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold"
109802,109803,A Winters Tale,4.0,4.4.27,PERDITA,The sternness of his presence?

109804,109805,A Winters Tale,5.0,4.4.29,FLORIZEL,"Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,"
109805,109806,A Winters Tale,5.0,4.4.30,FLORIZEL,"Humbling their deities to love, have taken"
109806,109807,A Winters Tale,5.0,4.4.31,FLORIZEL,The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter

109810,109811,A Winters Tale,5.0,4.4.35,FLORIZEL,As I seem now. Their transformations
109811,109812,A Winters Tale,5.0,4.4.36,FLORIZEL,"Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,"
109812,109813,A Winters Tale,5.0,4.4.37,FLORIZEL,"Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires"

109825,109826,A Winters Tale,7.0,4.4.50,FLORIZEL,Or not my father's. For I cannot be

109874,109875,A Winters Tale,13.0,4.4.97,PERDITA,Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind

109878,109879,A Winters Tale,14.0,4.4.101,POLIXENES,Do you neglect them?
109879,109880,A Winters Tale,15.0,4.4.102,PERDITA,For I have heard it said
109880,109881,A Winters Tale,15.0,4.4.103,PERDITA,There is an art which in their piedness shares
109881,109882,A Winters Tale,15.0,4.4.104,PERDITA,With great creating nature.

109883,109884,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.106,POLIXENES,Yet nature is made better by no mean
109884,109885,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.107,POLIXENES,"But nature makes that mean: so, over that art"
109885,109886,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.108,POLIXENES,"Which you say adds to nature, is an art"
109886,109887,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.109,POLIXENES,"That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry"
109887,109888,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.110,POLIXENES,"A gentler scion to the wildest stock,"
109888,109889,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.111,POLIXENES,And make conceive a bark of baser kind
109889,109890,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.112,POLIXENES,By bud of nobler race: this is an art
109890,109891,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.113,POLIXENES,"Which does mend nature, change it rather, but"
109891,109892,A Winters Tale,16.0,4.4.114,POLIXENES,The art itself is nature.
109892,109893,A Winters Tale,17.0,4.4.115,PERDITA,So it is.
109893,109894,A Winters Tale,18.0,4.4.116,POLIXENES,"Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,"
109894,109895,A Winters Tale,18.0,4.4.117,POLIXENES,And do not call them bastards.
109895,109896,A Winters Tale,19.0,4.4.118,PERDITA,I'll not put
109896,109897,A Winters Tale,19.0,4.4.119,PERDITA,"The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,"
109897,109898,A Winters Tale,19.0,4.4.120,PERDITA,No more than were I painted I would wish

109904,109905,A Winters Tale,19.0,4.4.127,PERDITA,To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
109905,109906,A Winters Tale,20.0,4.4.128,CAMILLO,"I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,"
109906,109907,A Winters Tale,20.0,4.4.129,CAMILLO,And only live by gazing.
109907,109908,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.130,PERDITA,"Out, alas!"
109908,109909,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.131,PERDITA,"You'd be so lean, that blasts of January"
109909,109910,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.132,PERDITA,Would blow you through and through.
109910,109911,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.133,PERDITA,"Now, my fair'st friend,"
109911,109912,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.134,PERDITA,I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might

109913,109914,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.136,PERDITA,That wear upon your virgin branches yet
109914,109915,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.137,PERDITA,"Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,"
109915,109916,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.138,PERDITA,"For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall"
109916,109917,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.139,PERDITA,"From Dis's waggon! daffodils,"
109917,109918,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.140,PERDITA,"That come before the swallow dares, and take"
109918,109919,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.141,PERDITA,"The winds of March with beauty, violets dim,"
109919,109920,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.142,PERDITA,But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
109920,109921,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.143,PERDITA,"Or Cytherea's breath, pale primroses"
109921,109922,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.144,PERDITA,"That die unmarried, ere they can behold"
109922,109923,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.145,PERDITA,Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
109923,109924,A Winters Tale,21.0,4.4.146,PERDITA,"Most incident to maids, bold oxlips and"

109929,109930,A Winters Tale,23.0,4.4.152,PERDITA,"No, like a bank for love to lie and play on,"
109930,109931,A Winters Tale,23.0,4.4.153,PERDITA,"Not like a corse, or if, not to be buried,"
109931,109932,A Winters Tale,23.0,4.4.154,PERDITA,"But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:"
109932,109933,A Winters Tale,23.0,4.4.155,PERDITA,Methinks I play as I have seen them do
109933,109934,A Winters Tale,23.0,4.4.156,PERDITA,In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
109934,109935,A Winters Tale,23.0,4.4.157,PERDITA,Does change my disposition.
109935,109936,A Winters Tale,24.0,4.4.158,FLORIZEL,What you do
109936,109937,A Winters Tale,24.0,4.4.159,FLORIZEL,"Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet."
109937,109938,A Winters Tale,24.0,4.4.160,FLORIZEL,"I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,"
109938,109939,A Winters Tale,24.0,4.4.161,FLORIZEL,"I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,"
109939,109940,A Winters Tale,24.0,4.4.162,FLORIZEL,"Pray so, and, for the ordering your affairs,"

109946,109947,A Winters Tale,24.0,4.4.169,FLORIZEL,That all your acts are queens.
109947,109948,A Winters Tale,25.0,4.4.170,PERDITA,"O Doricles,"
109948,109949,A Winters Tale,25.0,4.4.171,PERDITA,"Your praises are too large: but that your youth,"

109950,109951,A Winters Tale,25.0,4.4.173,PERDITA,"Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,"
109951,109952,A Winters Tale,25.0,4.4.174,PERDITA,"With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,"
109952,109953,A Winters Tale,25.0,4.4.175,PERDITA,You woo'd me the false way.

109956,109957,A Winters Tale,26.0,4.4.179,FLORIZEL,"Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,"
109957,109958,A Winters Tale,26.0,4.4.180,FLORIZEL,That never mean to part.
109958,109959,A Winters Tale,27.0,4.4.181,PERDITA,I'll swear for 'em.
109959,109960,A Winters Tale,28.0,4.4.182,POLIXENES,This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
109960,109961,A Winters Tale,28.0,4.4.183,POLIXENES,Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
109961,109962,A Winters Tale,28.0,4.4.184,POLIXENES,"But smacks of something greater than herself,"
109962,109963,A Winters Tale,28.0,4.4.185,POLIXENES,Too noble for this place.
109963,109964,A Winters Tale,29.0,4.4.186,CAMILLO,He tells her something

109965,109966,A Winters Tale,29.0,4.4.188,CAMILLO,The queen of curds and cream.
109966,109967,A Winters Tale,30.0,4.4.189,Clown,"Come on, strike up!"
109967,109968,A Winters Tale,31.0,4.4.190,DORCAS,"Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,"
109968,109969,A Winters Tale,31.0,4.4.191,DORCAS,To mend her kissing with!
109969,109970,A Winters Tale,32.0,4.4.192,MOPSA,"Now, in good time!"

110142,110143,A Winters Tale,93.0,4.4.356,Servant,be not too rough for some that know little but
110143,110144,A Winters Tale,93.0,4.4.357,Servant,"bowling, it will please plentifully."
110144,110145,A Winters Tale,94.0,4.4.358,Shepherd,Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
110145,110146,A Winters Tale,94.0,4.4.359,Shepherd,"homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you."
110146,110147,A Winters Tale,95.0,4.4.360,POLIXENES,"You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see"
110147,110148,A Winters Tale,95.0,4.4.361,POLIXENES,these four threes of herdsmen.
110148,110149,A Winters Tale,96.0,4.4.362,Servant,"One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath"
110149,110150,A Winters Tale,96.0,4.4.363,Servant,"danced before the king, and not the worst of the"
110150,110151,A Winters Tale,96.0,4.4.364,Servant,three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
110151,110152,A Winters Tale,97.0,4.4.365,Shepherd,Leave your prating: since these good men are
110152,110153,A Winters Tale,97.0,4.4.366,Shepherd,"pleased, let them come in, but quickly now."
110153,110154,A Winters Tale,98.0,4.4.367,Servant,"Why, they stay at door, sir."
110154,110155,A Winters Tale,98.0,,Servant,Exit
110155,110156,A Winters Tale,98.0,,Servant,Here a dance of twelve Satyrs
110156,110157,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.368,POLIXENES,"O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter."
110157,110158,A Winters Tale,99.0,,POLIXENES,To CAMILLO
110158,110159,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.369,POLIXENES,Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
110159,110160,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.370,POLIXENES,He's simple and tells much.
110160,110161,A Winters Tale,99.0,,POLIXENES,To FLORIZEL
110161,110162,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.371,POLIXENES,"How now, fair shepherd!"
110162,110163,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.372,POLIXENES,Your heart is full of something that does take
110163,110164,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.373,POLIXENES,"Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young"
110164,110165,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.374,POLIXENES,"And handed love as you do, I was wont"
110165,110166,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.375,POLIXENES,To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
110166,110167,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.376,POLIXENES,The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
110167,110168,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.377,POLIXENES,"To her acceptance, you have let him go"
110168,110169,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.378,POLIXENES,And nothing marted with him. If your lass
110169,110170,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.379,POLIXENES,Interpretation should abuse and call this
110170,110171,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.380,POLIXENES,"Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited"
110171,110172,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.381,POLIXENES,"For a reply, at least if you make a care"
110172,110173,A Winters Tale,99.0,4.4.382,POLIXENES,Of happy holding her.
110173,110174,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.383,FLORIZEL,"Old sir, I know"
110174,110175,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.384,FLORIZEL,She prizes not such trifles as these are:
110175,110176,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.385,FLORIZEL,The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
110176,110177,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.386,FLORIZEL,"Up in my heart, which I have given already,"
110177,110178,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.387,FLORIZEL,"But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life"
110178,110179,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.388,FLORIZEL,"Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,"
110179,110180,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.389,FLORIZEL,"Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,"
110180,110181,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.390,FLORIZEL,"As soft as dove's down and as white as it,"
110181,110182,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.391,FLORIZEL,"Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd"
110182,110183,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.392,FLORIZEL,snow that's bolted
110183,110184,A Winters Tale,100.0,4.4.393,FLORIZEL,By the northern blasts twice o'er.
110184,110185,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.394,POLIXENES,What follows this?
110185,110186,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.395,POLIXENES,How prettily the young swain seems to wash
110186,110187,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.396,POLIXENES,The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
110187,110188,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.397,POLIXENES,"But to your protestation, let me hear"
110188,110189,A Winters Tale,101.0,4.4.398,POLIXENES,What you profess.
110189,110190,A Winters Tale,102.0,4.4.399,FLORIZEL,"Do, and be witness to 't."
110190,110191,A Winters Tale,103.0,4.4.400,POLIXENES,And this my neighbour too?
110191,110192,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.401,FLORIZEL,"And he, and more"
110192,110193,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.402,FLORIZEL,"Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:"
110193,110194,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.403,FLORIZEL,"That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,"
110194,110195,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.404,FLORIZEL,"Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth"
110195,110196,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.405,FLORIZEL,"That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge"
110196,110197,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.406,FLORIZEL,"More than was ever man's, I would not prize them"
110197,110198,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.407,FLORIZEL,"Without her love, for her employ them all,"
110198,110199,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.408,FLORIZEL,Commend them and condemn them to her service
110199,110200,A Winters Tale,104.0,4.4.409,FLORIZEL,Or to their own perdition.
110200,110201,A Winters Tale,105.0,4.4.410,POLIXENES,Fairly offer'd.
110201,110202,A Winters Tale,106.0,4.4.411,CAMILLO,This shows a sound affection.
110202,110203,A Winters Tale,107.0,4.4.412,Shepherd,"But, my daughter,"
110203,110204,A Winters Tale,107.0,4.4.413,Shepherd,Say you the like to him?
110204,110205,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.414,PERDITA,I cannot speak
110205,110206,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.415,PERDITA,"So well, nothing so well, no, nor mean better:"
110206,110207,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.416,PERDITA,By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
110207,110208,A Winters Tale,108.0,4.4.417,PERDITA,The purity of his.
110208,110209,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.418,Shepherd,"Take hands, a bargain!"
110209,110210,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.419,Shepherd,"And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:"
110210,110211,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.420,Shepherd,"I give my daughter to him, and will make"
110211,110212,A Winters Tale,109.0,4.4.421,Shepherd,Her portion equal his.
110212,110213,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.422,FLORIZEL,"O, that must be"
110213,110214,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.423,FLORIZEL,"I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,"
110214,110215,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.424,FLORIZEL,"I shall have more than you can dream of yet,"
110215,110216,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.425,FLORIZEL,"Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,"
110216,110217,A Winters Tale,110.0,4.4.426,FLORIZEL,Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
110217,110218,A Winters Tale,111.0,4.4.427,Shepherd,"Come, your hand,"
110218,110219,A Winters Tale,111.0,4.4.428,Shepherd,"And, daughter, yours."
110219,110220,A Winters Tale,112.0,4.4.429,POLIXENES,"Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you,"
110220,110221,A Winters Tale,112.0,4.4.430,POLIXENES,Have you a father?
110221,110222,A Winters Tale,113.0,4.4.431,FLORIZEL,I have: but what of him?
110222,110223,A Winters Tale,114.0,4.4.432,POLIXENES,Knows he of this?
110223,110224,A Winters Tale,115.0,4.4.433,FLORIZEL,He neither does nor shall.
110224,110225,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.434,POLIXENES,Methinks a father
110225,110226,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.435,POLIXENES,Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
110226,110227,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.436,POLIXENES,"That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,"
110227,110228,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.437,POLIXENES,Is not your father grown incapable
110228,110229,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.438,POLIXENES,Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
110229,110230,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.439,POLIXENES,With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
110230,110231,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.440,POLIXENES,Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
110231,110232,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.441,POLIXENES,Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
110232,110233,A Winters Tale,116.0,4.4.442,POLIXENES,But what he did being childish?
110233,110234,A Winters Tale,117.0,4.4.443,FLORIZEL,"No, good sir,"
110234,110235,A Winters Tale,117.0,4.4.444,FLORIZEL,He has his health and ampler strength indeed
110235,110236,A Winters Tale,117.0,4.4.445,FLORIZEL,Than most have of his age.
110236,110237,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.446,POLIXENES,"By my white beard,"
110237,110238,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.447,POLIXENES,"You offer him, if this be so, a wrong"
110238,110239,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.448,POLIXENES,Something unfilial: reason my son
110239,110240,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.449,POLIXENES,"Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason"
110240,110241,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.450,POLIXENES,"The father, all whose joy is nothing else"
110241,110242,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.451,POLIXENES,"But fair posterity, should hold some counsel"
110242,110243,A Winters Tale,118.0,4.4.452,POLIXENES,In such a business.
110243,110244,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.453,FLORIZEL,"I yield all this,"
110244,110245,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.454,FLORIZEL,"But for some other reasons, my grave sir,"
110245,110246,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.455,FLORIZEL,"Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint"
110246,110247,A Winters Tale,119.0,4.4.456,FLORIZEL,My father of this business.
110247,110248,A Winters Tale,120.0,4.4.457,POLIXENES,Let him know't.
110248,110249,A Winters Tale,121.0,4.4.458,FLORIZEL,He shall not.
110249,110250,A Winters Tale,122.0,4.4.459,POLIXENES,"Prithee, let him."
110250,110251,A Winters Tale,123.0,4.4.460,FLORIZEL,"No, he must not."
110251,110252,A Winters Tale,124.0,4.4.461,Shepherd,"Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve"
110252,110253,A Winters Tale,124.0,4.4.462,Shepherd,At knowing of thy choice.
110253,110254,A Winters Tale,125.0,4.4.463,FLORIZEL,"Come, come, he must not."
110254,110255,A Winters Tale,125.0,4.4.464,FLORIZEL,Mark our contract.
110255,110256,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.465,POLIXENES,"Mark your divorce, young sir,"
110256,110257,A Winters Tale,126.0,,POLIXENES,Discovering himself
110257,110258,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.466,POLIXENES,"Whom son I dare not call, thou art too base"
110258,110259,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.467,POLIXENES,"To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,"
110259,110260,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.468,POLIXENES,"That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,"
110260,110261,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.469,POLIXENES,I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
110261,110262,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.470,POLIXENES,"But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece"
110262,110263,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.471,POLIXENES,"Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know"
110263,110264,A Winters Tale,126.0,4.4.472,POLIXENES,"The royal fool thou copest with,--"
110264,110265,A Winters Tale,127.0,4.4.473,Shepherd,"O, my heart!"
110265,110266,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.474,POLIXENES,"I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made"
110266,110267,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.475,POLIXENES,"More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,"
110267,110268,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.476,POLIXENES,If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
110268,110269,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.477,POLIXENES,"That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never"
110269,110270,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.478,POLIXENES,"I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession,"
110270,110271,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.479,POLIXENES,"Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,"
110271,110272,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.480,POLIXENES,Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
110272,110273,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.481,POLIXENES,"Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,"
110273,110274,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.482,POLIXENES,"Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee"
110274,110275,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.483,POLIXENES,"From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--"
110275,110276,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.484,POLIXENES,"Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,"
110276,110277,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.485,POLIXENES,"That makes himself, but for our honour therein,"
110277,110278,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.486,POLIXENES,"Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou"
110278,110279,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.487,POLIXENES,"These rural latches to his entrance open,"
110279,110280,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.488,POLIXENES,"Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,"
110280,110281,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.489,POLIXENES,I will devise a death as cruel for thee
110281,110282,A Winters Tale,128.0,4.4.490,POLIXENES,As thou art tender to't.
110282,110283,A Winters Tale,128.0,,POLIXENES,Exit
110283,110284,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.491,PERDITA,Even here undone!
110284,110285,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.492,PERDITA,"I was not much afeard, for once or twice"
110285,110286,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.493,PERDITA,"I was about to speak and tell him plainly,"
110286,110287,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.494,PERDITA,The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
110287,110288,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.495,PERDITA,Hides not his visage from our cottage but
110288,110289,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.496,PERDITA,"Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?"
110289,110290,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.497,PERDITA,"I told you what would come of this: beseech you,"
110290,110291,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.498,PERDITA,"Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--"
110291,110292,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.499,PERDITA,"Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,"
110292,110293,A Winters Tale,129.0,4.4.500,PERDITA,But milk my ewes and weep.
110293,110294,A Winters Tale,130.0,4.4.501,CAMILLO,"Why, how now, father!"
110294,110295,A Winters Tale,130.0,4.4.502,CAMILLO,Speak ere thou diest.
110295,110296,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.503,Shepherd,"I cannot speak, nor think"
110296,110297,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.504,Shepherd,Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
110297,110298,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.505,Shepherd,"You have undone a man of fourscore three,"
110298,110299,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.506,Shepherd,"That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,"
110299,110300,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.507,Shepherd,"To die upon the bed my father died,"
110300,110301,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.508,Shepherd,To lie close by his honest bones: but now
110301,110302,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.509,Shepherd,Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
110302,110303,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.510,Shepherd,"Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,"
110303,110304,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.511,Shepherd,"That knew'st this was the prince,"
110304,110305,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.512,Shepherd,and wouldst adventure
110305,110306,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.513,Shepherd,To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
110306,110307,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.514,Shepherd,"If I might die within this hour, I have lived"
110307,110308,A Winters Tale,131.0,4.4.515,Shepherd,To die when I desire.
110308,110309,A Winters Tale,131.0,,Shepherd,Exit
110309,110310,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.516,FLORIZEL,Why look you so upon me?
110310,110311,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.517,FLORIZEL,"I am but sorry, not afeard, delay'd,"
110311,110312,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.518,FLORIZEL,"But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am,"
110312,110313,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.519,FLORIZEL,"More straining on for plucking back, not following"
110313,110314,A Winters Tale,132.0,4.4.520,FLORIZEL,My leash unwillingly.
110314,110315,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.521,CAMILLO,"Gracious my lord,"
110315,110316,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.522,CAMILLO,You know your father's temper: at this time
110316,110317,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.523,CAMILLO,"He will allow no speech, which I do guess"
110317,110318,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.524,CAMILLO,"You do not purpose to him, and as hardly"
110318,110319,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.525,CAMILLO,"Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:"
110319,110320,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.526,CAMILLO,"Then, till the fury of his highness settle,"
110320,110321,A Winters Tale,133.0,4.4.527,CAMILLO,Come not before him.
110321,110322,A Winters Tale,134.0,4.4.528,FLORIZEL,I not purpose it.
110322,110323,A Winters Tale,134.0,4.4.529,FLORIZEL,"I think, Camillo?"
110323,110324,A Winters Tale,135.0,4.4.530,CAMILLO,"Even he, my lord."
110324,110325,A Winters Tale,136.0,4.4.531,PERDITA,How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
110325,110326,A Winters Tale,136.0,4.4.532,PERDITA,"How often said, my dignity would last"
110326,110327,A Winters Tale,136.0,4.4.533,PERDITA,But till 'twere known!
110327,110328,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.534,FLORIZEL,It cannot fail but by
110328,110329,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.535,FLORIZEL,"The violation of my faith, and then"
110329,110330,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.536,FLORIZEL,Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
110330,110331,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.537,FLORIZEL,And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
110331,110332,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.538,FLORIZEL,"From my succession wipe me, father, I"
110332,110333,A Winters Tale,137.0,4.4.539,FLORIZEL,Am heir to my affection.
110333,110334,A Winters Tale,138.0,4.4.540,CAMILLO,Be advised.
110334,110335,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.541,FLORIZEL,"I am, and by my fancy: if my reason"
110335,110336,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.542,FLORIZEL,"Will thereto be obedient, I have reason,"
110336,110337,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.543,FLORIZEL,"If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,"
110337,110338,A Winters Tale,139.0,4.4.544,FLORIZEL,Do bid it welcome.
110338,110339,A Winters Tale,140.0,4.4.545,CAMILLO,"This is desperate, sir."
110339,110340,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.546,FLORIZEL,"So call it: but it does fulfil my vow,"
110340,110341,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.547,FLORIZEL,"I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,"
110341,110342,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.548,FLORIZEL,"Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may"
110342,110343,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.549,FLORIZEL,"Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or"
110343,110344,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.550,FLORIZEL,The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
110344,110345,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.551,FLORIZEL,"In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath"
110345,110346,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.552,FLORIZEL,"To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,"
110346,110347,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.553,FLORIZEL,"As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,"
110347,110348,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.554,FLORIZEL,"When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not"
110348,110349,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.555,FLORIZEL,"To see him any more,--cast your good counsels"
110349,110350,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.556,FLORIZEL,"Upon his passion, let myself and fortune"
110350,110351,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.557,FLORIZEL,Tug for the time to come. This you may know
110351,110352,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.558,FLORIZEL,"And so deliver, I am put to sea"
110352,110353,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.559,FLORIZEL,"With her whom here I cannot hold on shore,"
110353,110354,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.560,FLORIZEL,And most opportune to our need I have
110354,110355,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.561,FLORIZEL,"A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared"
110355,110356,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.562,FLORIZEL,For this design. What course I mean to hold
110356,110357,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.563,FLORIZEL,"Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor"
110357,110358,A Winters Tale,141.0,4.4.564,FLORIZEL,Concern me the reporting.
110358,110359,A Winters Tale,142.0,4.4.565,CAMILLO,O my lord!
110359,110360,A Winters Tale,142.0,4.4.566,CAMILLO,"I would your spirit were easier for advice,"
110360,110361,A Winters Tale,142.0,4.4.567,CAMILLO,Or stronger for your need.
110361,110362,A Winters Tale,143.0,4.4.568,FLORIZEL,"Hark, Perdita"
110362,110363,A Winters Tale,143.0,,FLORIZEL,Drawing her aside
110363,110364,A Winters Tale,143.0,4.4.569,FLORIZEL,I'll hear you by and by.
110364,110365,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.570,CAMILLO,"He's irremoveable,"
110365,110366,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.571,CAMILLO,"Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if"
110366,110367,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.572,CAMILLO,"His going I could frame to serve my turn,"
110367,110368,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.573,CAMILLO,"Save him from danger, do him love and honour,"
110368,110369,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.574,CAMILLO,Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
110369,110370,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.575,CAMILLO,"And that unhappy king, my master, whom"
110370,110371,A Winters Tale,144.0,4.4.576,CAMILLO,I so much thirst to see.
110371,110372,A Winters Tale,145.0,4.4.577,FLORIZEL,"Now, good Camillo,"
110372,110373,A Winters Tale,145.0,4.4.578,FLORIZEL,I am so fraught with curious business that
110373,110374,A Winters Tale,145.0,4.4.579,FLORIZEL,I leave out ceremony.
110374,110375,A Winters Tale,146.0,4.4.580,CAMILLO,"Sir, I think"
110375,110376,A Winters Tale,146.0,4.4.581,CAMILLO,"You have heard of my poor services, i' the love"
110376,110377,A Winters Tale,146.0,4.4.582,CAMILLO,That I have borne your father?
110377,110378,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.583,FLORIZEL,Very nobly
110378,110379,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.584,FLORIZEL,Have you deserved: it is my father's music
110379,110380,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.585,FLORIZEL,"To speak your deeds, not little of his care"
110380,110381,A Winters Tale,147.0,4.4.586,FLORIZEL,To have them recompensed as thought on.
110381,110382,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.587,CAMILLO,"Well, my lord,"
110382,110383,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.588,CAMILLO,If you may please to think I love the king
110383,110384,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.589,CAMILLO,"And through him what is nearest to him, which is"
110384,110385,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.590,CAMILLO,"Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:"
110385,110386,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.591,CAMILLO,If your more ponderous and settled project
110386,110387,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.592,CAMILLO,"May suffer alteration, on mine honour,"
110387,110388,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.593,CAMILLO,I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
110388,110389,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.594,CAMILLO,"As shall become your highness, where you may"
110389,110390,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.595,CAMILLO,"Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,"
110390,110391,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.596,CAMILLO,"There's no disjunction to be made, but by--"
110391,110392,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.597,CAMILLO,"As heavens forefend!--your ruin, marry her,"
110392,110393,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.598,CAMILLO,"And, with my best endeavours in your absence,"
110393,110394,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.599,CAMILLO,Your discontenting father strive to qualify
110394,110395,A Winters Tale,148.0,4.4.600,CAMILLO,And bring him up to liking.
110395,110396,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.601,FLORIZEL,"How, Camillo,"
110396,110397,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.602,FLORIZEL,"May this, almost a miracle, be done?"
110397,110398,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.603,FLORIZEL,That I may call thee something more than man
110398,110399,A Winters Tale,149.0,4.4.604,FLORIZEL,And after that trust to thee.
110399,110400,A Winters Tale,150.0,4.4.605,CAMILLO,Have you thought on
110400,110401,A Winters Tale,150.0,4.4.606,CAMILLO,A place whereto you'll go?
110401,110402,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.607,FLORIZEL,Not any yet:
110402,110403,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.608,FLORIZEL,But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
110403,110404,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.609,FLORIZEL,"To what we wildly do, so we profess"
110404,110405,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.610,FLORIZEL,Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
110405,110406,A Winters Tale,151.0,4.4.611,FLORIZEL,Of every wind that blows.
110406,110407,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.612,CAMILLO,Then list to me:
110407,110408,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.613,CAMILLO,"This follows, if you will not change your purpose"
110408,110409,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.614,CAMILLO,"But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,"
110409,110410,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.615,CAMILLO,"And there present yourself and your fair princess,"
110410,110411,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.616,CAMILLO,"For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:"
110411,110412,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.617,CAMILLO,She shall be habited as it becomes
110412,110413,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.618,CAMILLO,The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
110413,110414,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.619,CAMILLO,Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
110414,110415,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.620,CAMILLO,"His welcomes forth, asks thee the son forgiveness,"
110415,110416,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.621,CAMILLO,"As 'twere i' the father's person, kisses the hands"
110416,110417,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.622,CAMILLO,"Of your fresh princess, o'er and o'er divides him"
110417,110418,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.623,CAMILLO,"'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness, the one"
110418,110419,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.624,CAMILLO,He chides to hell and bids the other grow
110419,110420,A Winters Tale,152.0,4.4.625,CAMILLO,Faster than thought or time.
110420,110421,A Winters Tale,153.0,4.4.626,FLORIZEL,"Worthy Camillo,"
110421,110422,A Winters Tale,153.0,4.4.627,FLORIZEL,What colour for my visitation shall I
110422,110423,A Winters Tale,153.0,4.4.628,FLORIZEL,Hold up before him?
110423,110424,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.629,CAMILLO,Sent by the king your father
110424,110425,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.630,CAMILLO,"To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,"
110425,110426,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.631,CAMILLO,"The manner of your bearing towards him, with"
110426,110427,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.632,CAMILLO,"What you as from your father shall deliver,"
110427,110428,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.633,CAMILLO,"Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:"
110428,110429,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.634,CAMILLO,The which shall point you forth at every sitting
110429,110430,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.635,CAMILLO,"What you must say, that he shall not perceive"
110430,110431,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.636,CAMILLO,But that you have your father's bosom there
110431,110432,A Winters Tale,154.0,4.4.637,CAMILLO,And speak his very heart.
110432,110433,A Winters Tale,155.0,4.4.638,FLORIZEL,I am bound to you:
110433,110434,A Winters Tale,155.0,4.4.639,FLORIZEL,There is some sap in this.
110434,110435,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.640,CAMILLO,A cause more promising
110435,110436,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.641,CAMILLO,Than a wild dedication of yourselves
110436,110437,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.642,CAMILLO,"To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain"
110437,110438,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.643,CAMILLO,"To miseries enough, no hope to help you,"
110438,110439,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.644,CAMILLO,"But as you shake off one to take another,"
110439,110440,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.645,CAMILLO,"Nothing so certain as your anchors, who"
110440,110441,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.646,CAMILLO,"Do their best office, if they can but stay you"
110441,110442,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.647,CAMILLO,Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
110442,110443,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.648,CAMILLO,"Prosperity's the very bond of love,"
110443,110444,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.649,CAMILLO,Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
110444,110445,A Winters Tale,156.0,4.4.650,CAMILLO,Affliction alters.
110445,110446,A Winters Tale,157.0,4.4.651,PERDITA,One of these is true:
110446,110447,A Winters Tale,157.0,4.4.652,PERDITA,"I think affliction may subdue the cheek,"
110447,110448,A Winters Tale,157.0,4.4.653,PERDITA,But not take in the mind.
110448,110449,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.654,CAMILLO,"Yea, say you so?"
110449,110450,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.655,CAMILLO,There shall not at your father's house these
110450,110451,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.656,CAMILLO,seven years
110451,110452,A Winters Tale,158.0,4.4.657,CAMILLO,Be born another such.
110452,110453,A Winters Tale,159.0,4.4.658,FLORIZEL,"My good Camillo,"
110453,110454,A Winters Tale,159.0,4.4.659,FLORIZEL,She is as forward of her breeding as
110454,110455,A Winters Tale,159.0,4.4.660,FLORIZEL,She is i' the rear our birth.
110455,110456,A Winters Tale,160.0,4.4.661,CAMILLO,I cannot say 'tis pity
110456,110457,A Winters Tale,160.0,4.4.662,CAMILLO,"She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress"
110457,110458,A Winters Tale,160.0,4.4.663,CAMILLO,To most that teach.
110458,110459,A Winters Tale,161.0,4.4.664,PERDITA,"Your pardon, sir, for this"
110459,110460,A Winters Tale,161.0,4.4.665,PERDITA,I'll blush you thanks.
110460,110461,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.666,FLORIZEL,My prettiest Perdita!
110461,110462,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.667,FLORIZEL,"But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,"
110462,110463,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.668,FLORIZEL,"Preserver of my father, now of me,"
110463,110464,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.669,FLORIZEL,"The medicine of our house, how shall we do?"
110464,110465,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.670,FLORIZEL,"We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,"
110465,110466,A Winters Tale,162.0,4.4.671,FLORIZEL,Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
110466,110467,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.672,CAMILLO,"My lord,"
110467,110468,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.673,CAMILLO,Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
110468,110469,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.674,CAMILLO,Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
110469,110470,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.675,CAMILLO,To have you royally appointed as if
110470,110471,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.676,CAMILLO,"The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,"
110471,110472,A Winters Tale,163.0,4.4.677,CAMILLO,"That you may know you shall not want, one word."
110472,110473,A Winters Tale,163.0,,CAMILLO,They talk aside
110473,110474,A Winters Tale,163.0,,CAMILLO,Re-enter AUTOLYCUS
110474,110475,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.678,AUTOLYCUS,"Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his"
110475,110476,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.679,AUTOLYCUS,"sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold"

110479,110480,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.683,AUTOLYCUS,to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
110480,110481,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.684,AUTOLYCUS,"should buy first, as if my trinkets had been"
110481,110482,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.685,AUTOLYCUS,hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
110482,110483,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.686,AUTOLYCUS,by which means I saw whose purse was best in
110483,110484,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.687,AUTOLYCUS,"picture, and what I saw, to my good use I"
110484,110485,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.688,AUTOLYCUS,"remembered. My clown, who wants but something to"
110485,110486,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.689,AUTOLYCUS,"be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the"
110486,110487,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.690,AUTOLYCUS,"wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes"
110487,110488,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.691,AUTOLYCUS,"till he had both tune and words, which so drew the"
110488,110489,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.692,AUTOLYCUS,rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
110489,110490,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.693,AUTOLYCUS,"stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it"
110490,110491,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.694,AUTOLYCUS,"was senseless, 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a"
110491,110492,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.695,AUTOLYCUS,"purse, I could have filed keys off that hung in"
110492,110493,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.696,AUTOLYCUS,"chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,"
110493,110494,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.697,AUTOLYCUS,and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
110494,110495,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.698,AUTOLYCUS,time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
110495,110496,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.699,AUTOLYCUS,"festival purses, and had not the old man come in"
110496,110497,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.700,AUTOLYCUS,with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
110497,110498,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.701,AUTOLYCUS,"son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not"
110498,110499,A Winters Tale,164.0,4.4.702,AUTOLYCUS,left a purse alive in the whole army.
110499,110500,A Winters Tale,164.0,,AUTOLYCUS,"CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward"
110500,110501,A Winters Tale,165.0,4.4.703,CAMILLO,"Nay, but my letters, by this means being there"
110501,110502,A Winters Tale,165.0,4.4.704,CAMILLO,"So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt."
110502,110503,A Winters Tale,166.0,4.4.705,FLORIZEL,And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
110503,110504,A Winters Tale,167.0,4.4.706,CAMILLO,Shall satisfy your father.
110504,110505,A Winters Tale,168.0,4.4.707,PERDITA,Happy be you!
110505,110506,A Winters Tale,168.0,4.4.708,PERDITA,All that you speak shows fair.
110506,110507,A Winters Tale,169.0,4.4.709,CAMILLO,Who have we here?
110507,110508,A Winters Tale,169.0,,CAMILLO,Seeing AUTOLYCUS
110508,110509,A Winters Tale,169.0,4.4.710,CAMILLO,"We'll make an instrument of this, omit"
110509,110510,A Winters Tale,169.0,4.4.711,CAMILLO,Nothing may give us aid.
110510,110511,A Winters Tale,170.0,4.4.712,AUTOLYCUS,"If they have overheard me now, why, hanging."
110511,110512,A Winters Tale,171.0,4.4.713,CAMILLO,"How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear"
110512,110513,A Winters Tale,171.0,4.4.714,CAMILLO,"not, man, here's no harm intended to thee."
110513,110514,A Winters Tale,172.0,4.4.715,AUTOLYCUS,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
110514,110515,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.716,CAMILLO,"Why, be so still, here's nobody will steal that from"
110515,110516,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.717,CAMILLO,thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
110516,110517,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.718,CAMILLO,"make an exchange, therefore discase thee instantly,"
110517,110518,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.719,CAMILLO,"--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and"
110518,110519,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.720,CAMILLO,change garments with this gentleman: though the
110519,110520,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.721,CAMILLO,"pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,"
110520,110521,A Winters Tale,173.0,4.4.722,CAMILLO,there's some boot.
110521,110522,A Winters Tale,174.0,4.4.723,AUTOLYCUS,"I am a poor fellow, sir."
110522,110523,A Winters Tale,174.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Aside
110523,110524,A Winters Tale,174.0,4.4.724,AUTOLYCUS,I know ye well enough.
110524,110525,A Winters Tale,175.0,4.4.725,CAMILLO,"Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half"
110525,110526,A Winters Tale,175.0,4.4.726,CAMILLO,flayed already.
110526,110527,A Winters Tale,176.0,4.4.727,AUTOLYCUS,"Are you in earnest, sir?"
110527,110528,A Winters Tale,176.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Aside
110528,110529,A Winters Tale,176.0,4.4.728,AUTOLYCUS,I smell the trick on't.
110529,110530,A Winters Tale,177.0,4.4.729,FLORIZEL,"Dispatch, I prithee."
110530,110531,A Winters Tale,178.0,4.4.730,AUTOLYCUS,"Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with"
110531,110532,A Winters Tale,178.0,4.4.731,AUTOLYCUS,conscience take it.
110532,110533,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.732,CAMILLO,"Unbuckle, unbuckle."
110533,110534,A Winters Tale,179.0,,CAMILLO,FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments
110534,110535,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.733,CAMILLO,"Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy"
110535,110536,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.734,CAMILLO,Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
110536,110537,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.735,CAMILLO,Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
110537,110538,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.736,CAMILLO,"And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,"
110538,110539,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.737,CAMILLO,"Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken"
110539,110540,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.738,CAMILLO,"The truth of your own seeming, that you may--"
110540,110541,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.739,CAMILLO,For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
110541,110542,A Winters Tale,179.0,4.4.740,CAMILLO,Get undescried.
110542,110543,A Winters Tale,180.0,4.4.741,PERDITA,I see the play so lies
110543,110544,A Winters Tale,180.0,4.4.742,PERDITA,That I must bear a part.
110544,110545,A Winters Tale,181.0,4.4.743,CAMILLO,No remedy.
110545,110546,A Winters Tale,181.0,4.4.744,CAMILLO,Have you done there?
110546,110547,A Winters Tale,182.0,4.4.745,FLORIZEL,"Should I now meet my father,"
110547,110548,A Winters Tale,182.0,4.4.746,FLORIZEL,He would not call me son.
110548,110549,A Winters Tale,183.0,4.4.747,CAMILLO,"Nay, you shall have no hat."
110549,110550,A Winters Tale,183.0,,CAMILLO,Giving it to PERDITA
110550,110551,A Winters Tale,183.0,4.4.748,CAMILLO,"Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend."
110551,110552,A Winters Tale,184.0,4.4.749,AUTOLYCUS,"Adieu, sir."
110552,110553,A Winters Tale,185.0,4.4.750,FLORIZEL,"O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!"
110553,110554,A Winters Tale,185.0,4.4.751,FLORIZEL,"Pray you, a word."
110554,110555,A Winters Tale,186.0,4.4.752,CAMILLO,"[Aside]  What I do next, shall be to tell the king"
110555,110556,A Winters Tale,186.0,4.4.753,CAMILLO,"Of this escape and whither they are bound,"
110556,110557,A Winters Tale,186.0,4.4.754,CAMILLO,Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
110557,110558,A Winters Tale,186.0,4.4.755,CAMILLO,To force him after: in whose company
110558,110559,A Winters Tale,186.0,4.4.756,CAMILLO,"I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight"
110559,110560,A Winters Tale,186.0,4.4.757,CAMILLO,I have a woman's longing.
110560,110561,A Winters Tale,187.0,4.4.758,FLORIZEL,Fortune speed us!
110561,110562,A Winters Tale,187.0,4.4.759,FLORIZEL,"Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side."
110562,110563,A Winters Tale,188.0,4.4.760,CAMILLO,The swifter speed the better.
110563,110564,A Winters Tale,188.0,,CAMILLO,"Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO"
110564,110565,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.761,AUTOLYCUS,"I understand the business, I hear it: to have an"
110565,110566,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.762,AUTOLYCUS,"open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is"
110566,110567,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.763,AUTOLYCUS,"necessary for a cut-purse, a good nose is requisite"
110567,110568,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.764,AUTOLYCUS,"also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see"
110568,110569,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.765,AUTOLYCUS,this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
110569,110570,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.766,AUTOLYCUS,What an exchange had this been without boot! What
110570,110571,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.767,AUTOLYCUS,a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
110571,110572,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.768,AUTOLYCUS,"this year connive at us, and we may do any thing"
110572,110573,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.769,AUTOLYCUS,extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
110573,110574,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.770,AUTOLYCUS,"iniquity, stealing away from his father with his"
110574,110575,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.771,AUTOLYCUS,clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
110575,110576,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.772,AUTOLYCUS,"honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not"
110576,110577,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.773,AUTOLYCUS,"do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it,"
110577,110578,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.774,AUTOLYCUS,and therein am I constant to my profession.
110578,110579,A Winters Tale,189.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Re-enter Clown and Shepherd
110579,110580,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.775,AUTOLYCUS,"Aside, aside, here is more matter for a hot brain:"
110580,110581,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.776,AUTOLYCUS,"every lane's end, every shop, church, session,"
110581,110582,A Winters Tale,189.0,4.4.777,AUTOLYCUS,"hanging, yields a careful man work."
110582,110583,A Winters Tale,190.0,4.4.778,Clown,"See, see, what a man you are now!"
110583,110584,A Winters Tale,190.0,4.4.779,Clown,There is no other way but to tell the king
110584,110585,A Winters Tale,190.0,4.4.780,Clown,she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
110585,110586,A Winters Tale,191.0,4.4.781,Shepherd,"Nay, but hear me."
110586,110587,A Winters Tale,192.0,4.4.782,Clown,"Nay, but hear me."
110587,110588,A Winters Tale,193.0,4.4.783,Shepherd,"Go to, then."
110588,110589,A Winters Tale,194.0,4.4.784,Clown,"She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh"
110589,110590,A Winters Tale,194.0,4.4.785,Clown,"and blood has not offended the king, and so your"
110590,110591,A Winters Tale,194.0,4.4.786,Clown,flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
110591,110592,A Winters Tale,194.0,4.4.787,Clown,"those things you found about her, those secret"
110592,110593,A Winters Tale,194.0,4.4.788,Clown,"things, all but what she has with her: this being"
110593,110594,A Winters Tale,194.0,4.4.789,Clown,"done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you."
110594,110595,A Winters Tale,195.0,4.4.790,Shepherd,"I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his"
110595,110596,A Winters Tale,195.0,4.4.791,Shepherd,"son's pranks too, who, I may say, is no honest man,"
110596,110597,A Winters Tale,195.0,4.4.792,Shepherd,"neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make"
110597,110598,A Winters Tale,195.0,4.4.793,Shepherd,me the king's brother-in-law.
110598,110599,A Winters Tale,196.0,4.4.794,Clown,"Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you"
110599,110600,A Winters Tale,196.0,4.4.795,Clown,could have been to him and then your blood had been
110600,110601,A Winters Tale,196.0,4.4.796,Clown,the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
110601,110602,A Winters Tale,197.0,4.4.797,AUTOLYCUS,"[Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!"
110602,110603,A Winters Tale,198.0,4.4.798,Shepherd,"Well, let us to the king: there is that in this"
110603,110604,A Winters Tale,198.0,4.4.799,Shepherd,fardel will make him scratch his beard.
110604,110605,A Winters Tale,199.0,4.4.800,AUTOLYCUS,[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaint
110605,110606,A Winters Tale,199.0,4.4.801,AUTOLYCUS,may be to the flight of my master.
110606,110607,A Winters Tale,200.0,4.4.802,Clown,Pray heartily he be at palace.

110608,110609,A Winters Tale,201.0,4.4.804,AUTOLYCUS,sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.
110609,110610,A Winters Tale,201.0,,AUTOLYCUS,Takes off his false beard
110610,110611,A Winters Tale,201.0,4.4.805,AUTOLYCUS,"How now, rustics! whither are you bound?"
110611,110612,A Winters Tale,202.0,4.4.806,Shepherd,"To the palace, an it like your worship."
110612,110613,A Winters Tale,203.0,4.4.807,AUTOLYCUS,"Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition"
110613,110614,A Winters Tale,203.0,4.4.808,AUTOLYCUS,"of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your"

110616,110617,A Winters Tale,204.0,4.4.811,Clown,"We are but plain fellows, sir."
110617,110618,A Winters Tale,205.0,4.4.812,AUTOLYCUS,"A lie, you are rough and hairy. Let me have no"
110618,110619,A Winters Tale,205.0,4.4.813,AUTOLYCUS,"lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they"
110619,110620,A Winters Tale,205.0,4.4.814,AUTOLYCUS,often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
110620,110621,A Winters Tale,205.0,4.4.815,AUTOLYCUS,"it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel, therefore"
110621,110622,A Winters Tale,205.0,4.4.816,AUTOLYCUS,they do not give us the lie.
110622,110623,A Winters Tale,206.0,4.4.817,Clown,"Your worship had like to have given us one, if you"
110623,110624,A Winters Tale,206.0,4.4.818,Clown,had not taken yourself with the manner.
110624,110625,A Winters Tale,207.0,4.4.819,Shepherd,"Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?"
110625,110626,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.820,AUTOLYCUS,"Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest"
110626,110627,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.821,AUTOLYCUS,thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
110627,110628,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.822,AUTOLYCUS,hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
110628,110629,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.823,AUTOLYCUS,receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
110629,110630,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.824,AUTOLYCUS,"not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,"
110630,110631,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.825,AUTOLYCUS,"for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy"
110631,110632,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.826,AUTOLYCUS,"business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier"
110632,110633,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.827,AUTOLYCUS,"cap-a-pe, and one that will either push on or pluck"
110633,110634,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.828,AUTOLYCUS,back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
110634,110635,A Winters Tale,208.0,4.4.829,AUTOLYCUS,open thy affair.
110635,110636,A Winters Tale,209.0,4.4.830,Shepherd,"My business, sir, is to the king."
110636,110637,A Winters Tale,210.0,4.4.831,AUTOLYCUS,What advocate hast thou to him?
110637,110638,A Winters Tale,211.0,4.4.832,Shepherd,"I know not, an't like you."
110638,110639,A Winters Tale,212.0,4.4.833,Clown,Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
110639,110640,A Winters Tale,212.0,4.4.834,Clown,have none.
110640,110641,A Winters Tale,213.0,4.4.835,Shepherd,"None, sir, I have no pheasant, cock nor hen."
110641,110642,A Winters Tale,214.0,4.4.836,AUTOLYCUS,How blessed are we that are not simple men!
110642,110643,A Winters Tale,214.0,4.4.837,AUTOLYCUS,"Yet nature might have made me as these are,"
110643,110644,A Winters Tale,214.0,4.4.838,AUTOLYCUS,Therefore I will not disdain.

110777,110778,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.38,DION,"For present comfort and for future good,"
110778,110779,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.1.39,DION,To bless the bed of majesty again

110805,110806,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.1.65,PAULINA,More rich for what they yielded.
110806,110807,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.66,LEONTES,Thou speak'st truth.
110807,110808,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.67,LEONTES,"No more such wives, therefore, no wife: one worse,"
110808,110809,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.1.68,LEONTES,"And better used, would make her sainted spirit"

110816,110817,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.76,PAULINA,I should so.
110817,110818,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.77,PAULINA,"Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark"
110818,110819,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.78,PAULINA,"Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't"
110819,110820,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.79,PAULINA,"You chose her, then I'ld shriek, that even your ears"
110820,110821,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.80,PAULINA,"Should rift to hear me, and the words that follow'd"
110821,110822,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.1.81,PAULINA,Should be 'Remember mine.'
110822,110823,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.1.82,LEONTES,"Stars, stars,"
110823,110824,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.1.83,LEONTES,"And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife,"
110824,110825,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.1.84,LEONTES,"I'll have no wife, Paulina."
110825,110826,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.1.85,PAULINA,Will you swear
110826,110827,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.1.86,PAULINA,Never to marry but by my free leave?
110827,110828,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.1.87,LEONTES,"Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit!"
110828,110829,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.1.88,PAULINA,"Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath."
110829,110830,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.1.89,CLEOMENES,You tempt him over-much.
110830,110831,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.1.90,PAULINA,"Unless another,"
110831,110832,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.1.91,PAULINA,"As like Hermione as is her picture,"
110832,110833,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.1.92,PAULINA,Affront his eye.
110833,110834,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.1.93,CLEOMENES,"Good madam,--"
110834,110835,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.94,PAULINA,I have done.
110835,110836,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.95,PAULINA,"Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,"
110836,110837,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.96,PAULINA,"No remedy, but you will,--give me the office"
110837,110838,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.97,PAULINA,To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
110838,110839,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.98,PAULINA,"As was your former, but she shall be such"
110839,110840,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.99,PAULINA,"As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,"
110840,110841,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.100,PAULINA,it should take joy
110841,110842,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.1.101,PAULINA,To see her in your arms.
110842,110843,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.1.102,LEONTES,"My true Paulina,"
110843,110844,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.1.103,LEONTES,We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
110844,110845,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.1.104,PAULINA,That
110845,110846,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.1.105,PAULINA,"Shall be when your first queen's again in breath,"
110846,110847,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.1.106,PAULINA,Never till then.
110847,110848,A Winters Tale,24.0,,PAULINA,Enter a Gentleman
110848,110849,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.107,Gentleman,"One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,"
110849,110850,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.108,Gentleman,"Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she"
110850,110851,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.109,Gentleman,"The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access"
110851,110852,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.1.110,Gentleman,To your high presence.
110852,110853,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.111,LEONTES,What with him? he comes not
110853,110854,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.112,LEONTES,"Like to his father's greatness: his approach,"
110854,110855,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.113,LEONTES,"So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us"
110855,110856,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.114,LEONTES,"'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced"
110856,110857,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.1.115,LEONTES,By need and accident. What train?
110857,110858,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.1.116,Gentleman,"But few,"
110858,110859,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.1.117,Gentleman,And those but mean.
110859,110860,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.1.118,LEONTES,"His princess, say you, with him?"
110860,110861,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.1.119,Gentleman,"Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,"
110861,110862,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.1.120,Gentleman,That e'er the sun shone bright on.
110862,110863,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.121,PAULINA,"O Hermione,"
110863,110864,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.122,PAULINA,As every present time doth boast itself
110864,110865,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.123,PAULINA,"Above a better gone, so must thy grave"
110865,110866,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.124,PAULINA,"Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself"
110866,110867,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.125,PAULINA,"Have said and writ so, but your writing now"
110867,110868,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.126,PAULINA,"Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,"
110868,110869,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.127,PAULINA,"Nor was not to be equall'd,'--thus your verse"
110869,110870,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.128,PAULINA,"Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,"
110870,110871,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.1.129,PAULINA,To say you have seen a better.
110871,110872,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.130,Gentleman,"Pardon, madam:"
110872,110873,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.131,Gentleman,"The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--"
110873,110874,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.132,Gentleman,"The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,"
110874,110875,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.133,Gentleman,"Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,"
110875,110876,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.134,Gentleman,"Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal"
110876,110877,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.135,Gentleman,"Of all professors else, make proselytes"
110877,110878,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.1.136,Gentleman,Of who she but bid follow.
110878,110879,A Winters Tale,32.0,5.1.137,PAULINA,How! not women?
110879,110880,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.1.138,Gentleman,"Women will love her, that she is a woman"
110880,110881,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.1.139,Gentleman,"More worth than any man, men, that she is"
110881,110882,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.1.140,Gentleman,The rarest of all women.
110882,110883,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.141,LEONTES,"Go, Cleomenes,"
110883,110884,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.142,LEONTES,"Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,"
110884,110885,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.143,LEONTES,"Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange"
110885,110886,A Winters Tale,34.0,,LEONTES,Exeunt CLEOMENES and others
110886,110887,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.1.144,LEONTES,He thus should steal upon us.
110887,110888,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.145,PAULINA,"Had our prince,"
110888,110889,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.146,PAULINA,"Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd"
110889,110890,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.147,PAULINA,Well with this lord: there was not full a month
110890,110891,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.1.148,PAULINA,Between their births.
110891,110892,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.149,LEONTES,"Prithee, no more, cease, thou know'st"
110892,110893,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.150,LEONTES,"He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,"
110893,110894,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.151,LEONTES,"When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches"
110894,110895,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.152,LEONTES,Will bring me to consider that which may
110895,110896,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.153,LEONTES,Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
110896,110897,A Winters Tale,36.0,,LEONTES,"Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA"
110897,110898,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.154,LEONTES,"Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince,"
110898,110899,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.155,LEONTES,"For she did print your royal father off,"
110899,110900,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.156,LEONTES,"Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,"
110900,110901,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.157,LEONTES,"Your father's image is so hit in you,"
110901,110902,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.158,LEONTES,"His very air, that I should call you brother,"
110902,110903,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.159,LEONTES,"As I did him, and speak of something wildly"
110903,110904,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.160,LEONTES,By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
110904,110905,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.161,LEONTES,"And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!"
110905,110906,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.162,LEONTES,"I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth"
110906,110907,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.163,LEONTES,Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
110907,110908,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.164,LEONTES,"You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--"
110908,110909,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.165,LEONTES,"All mine own folly--the society,"
110909,110910,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.166,LEONTES,"Amity too, of your brave father, whom,"
110910,110911,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.167,LEONTES,"Though bearing misery, I desire my life"
110911,110912,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.1.168,LEONTES,Once more to look on him.
110912,110913,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.169,FLORIZEL,By his command
110913,110914,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.170,FLORIZEL,Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
110914,110915,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.171,FLORIZEL,"Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,"
110915,110916,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.172,FLORIZEL,"Can send his brother: and, but infirmity"
110916,110917,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.173,FLORIZEL,Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
110917,110918,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.174,FLORIZEL,"His wish'd ability, he had himself"
110918,110919,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.175,FLORIZEL,The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his

110920,110921,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.177,FLORIZEL,He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
110921,110922,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.1.178,FLORIZEL,And those that bear them living.
110922,110923,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.179,LEONTES,"O my brother,"
110923,110924,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.180,LEONTES,Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
110924,110925,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.181,LEONTES,"Afresh within me, and these thy offices,"
110925,110926,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.182,LEONTES,"So rarely kind, are as interpreters"
110926,110927,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.183,LEONTES,"Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,"
110927,110928,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.184,LEONTES,As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
110928,110929,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.185,LEONTES,"Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,"
110929,110930,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.186,LEONTES,"At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,"
110930,110931,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.187,LEONTES,"To greet a man not worth her pains, much less"
110931,110932,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.1.188,LEONTES,The adventure of her person?
110932,110933,A Winters Tale,39.0,5.1.189,FLORIZEL,"Good my lord,"
110933,110934,A Winters Tale,39.0,5.1.190,FLORIZEL,She came from Libya.

110938,110939,A Winters Tale,41.0,5.1.195,FLORIZEL,"A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,"
110939,110940,A Winters Tale,41.0,5.1.196,FLORIZEL,To execute the charge my father gave me
110940,110941,A Winters Tale,41.0,5.1.197,FLORIZEL,For visiting your highness: my best train

110944,110945,A Winters Tale,41.0,5.1.201,FLORIZEL,But my arrival and my wife's in safety
110945,110946,A Winters Tale,41.0,5.1.202,FLORIZEL,Here where we are.

110989,110990,A Winters Tale,50.0,5.1.245,PERDITA,Our contract celebrated.
110990,110991,A Winters Tale,51.0,5.1.246,LEONTES,You are married?
110991,110992,A Winters Tale,52.0,5.1.247,FLORIZEL,"We are not, sir, nor are we like to be,"
110992,110993,A Winters Tale,52.0,5.1.248,FLORIZEL,"The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:"
110993,110994,A Winters Tale,52.0,5.1.249,FLORIZEL,The odds for high and low's alike.
110994,110995,A Winters Tale,53.0,5.1.250,LEONTES,"My lord,"
110995,110996,A Winters Tale,53.0,5.1.251,LEONTES,Is this the daughter of a king?
110996,110997,A Winters Tale,54.0,5.1.252,FLORIZEL,"She is,"
110997,110998,A Winters Tale,54.0,5.1.253,FLORIZEL,When once she is my wife.
110998,110999,A Winters Tale,55.0,5.1.254,LEONTES,That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
110999,111000,A Winters Tale,55.0,5.1.255,LEONTES,"Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,"
111000,111001,A Winters Tale,55.0,5.1.256,LEONTES,"Most sorry, you have broken from his liking"
111001,111002,A Winters Tale,55.0,5.1.257,LEONTES,"Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry"
111002,111003,A Winters Tale,55.0,5.1.258,LEONTES,"Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,"
111003,111004,A Winters Tale,55.0,5.1.259,LEONTES,That you might well enjoy her.
111004,111005,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.260,FLORIZEL,"Dear, look up:"
111005,111006,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.261,FLORIZEL,"Though Fortune, visible an enemy,"
111006,111007,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.262,FLORIZEL,"Should chase us with my father, power no jot"
111007,111008,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.263,FLORIZEL,"Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,"
111008,111009,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.264,FLORIZEL,Remember since you owed no more to time
111009,111010,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.265,FLORIZEL,"Than I do now: with thought of such affections,"
111010,111011,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.266,FLORIZEL,"Step forth mine advocate, at your request"
111011,111012,A Winters Tale,56.0,5.1.267,FLORIZEL,My father will grant precious things as trifles.
111012,111013,A Winters Tale,57.0,5.1.268,LEONTES,"Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,"
111013,111014,A Winters Tale,57.0,5.1.269,LEONTES,Which he counts but a trifle.
111014,111015,A Winters Tale,58.0,5.1.270,PAULINA,"Sir, my liege,"
111015,111016,A Winters Tale,58.0,5.1.271,PAULINA,Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
111016,111017,A Winters Tale,58.0,5.1.272,PAULINA,"'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes"
111017,111018,A Winters Tale,58.0,5.1.273,PAULINA,Than what you look on now.
111018,111019,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.274,LEONTES,"I thought of her,"
111019,111020,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.275,LEONTES,Even in these looks I made.
111020,111021,A Winters Tale,59.0,,LEONTES,To FLORIZEL
111021,111022,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.276,LEONTES,But your petition
111022,111023,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.277,LEONTES,Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
111023,111024,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.278,LEONTES,"Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,"
111024,111025,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.279,LEONTES,I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
111025,111026,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.280,LEONTES,"I now go toward him, therefore follow me"
111026,111027,A Winters Tale,59.0,5.1.281,LEONTES,"And mark what way I make: come, good my lord."
111027,111028,A Winters Tale,59.0,,LEONTES,Exeunt
111028,111029,A Winters Tale,59.0,,LEONTES,SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.
111029,111030,A Winters Tale,59.0,,LEONTES,Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman
111030,111031,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.2.1,AUTOLYCUS,"Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?"
111031,111032,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.2,First Gentleman,"I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old"
111032,111033,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.3,First Gentleman,shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
111033,111034,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.4,First Gentleman,"whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all"
111034,111035,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.5,First Gentleman,"commanded out of the chamber, only this methought I"
111035,111036,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.2.6,First Gentleman,"heard the shepherd say, he found the child."
111036,111037,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.2.7,AUTOLYCUS,I would most gladly know the issue of it.
111037,111038,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.8,First Gentleman,"I make a broken delivery of the business, but the"
111038,111039,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.9,First Gentleman,changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
111039,111040,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.10,First Gentleman,"very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with"
111040,111041,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.11,First Gentleman,"staring on one another, to tear the cases of their"
111041,111042,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.12,First Gentleman,"eyes, there was speech in their dumbness, language"
111042,111043,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.13,First Gentleman,"in their very gesture, they looked as they had heard"
111043,111044,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.14,First Gentleman,"of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable"
111044,111045,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.15,First Gentleman,"passion of wonder appeared in them, but the wisest"
111045,111046,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.16,First Gentleman,"beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not"
111046,111047,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.17,First Gentleman,"say if the importance were joy or sorrow, but in the"
111047,111048,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.18,First Gentleman,"extremity of the one, it must needs be."
111048,111049,A Winters Tale,4.0,,First Gentleman,Enter another Gentleman
111049,111050,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.19,First Gentleman,Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
111050,111051,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.2.20,First Gentleman,"The news, Rogero?"
111051,111052,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.21,Second Gentleman,"Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled, the"
111052,111053,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.22,Second Gentleman,king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
111053,111054,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.23,Second Gentleman,broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
111054,111055,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.24,Second Gentleman,cannot be able to express it.
111055,111056,A Winters Tale,5.0,,Second Gentleman,Enter a third Gentleman
111056,111057,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.25,Second Gentleman,Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
111057,111058,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.26,Second Gentleman,"deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news"
111058,111059,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.27,Second Gentleman,"which is called true is so like an old tale, that"
111059,111060,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.28,Second Gentleman,the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
111060,111061,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.2.29,Second Gentleman,found his heir?
111061,111062,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.30,Third Gentleman,"Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by"
111062,111063,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.31,Third Gentleman,circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
111063,111064,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.32,Third Gentleman,"see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle"
111064,111065,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.33,Third Gentleman,"of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,"
111065,111066,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.34,Third Gentleman,the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
111066,111067,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.35,Third Gentleman,"know to be his character, the majesty of the"
111067,111068,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.36,Third Gentleman,"creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection"
111068,111069,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.37,Third Gentleman,"of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,"
111069,111070,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.38,Third Gentleman,and many other evidences proclaim her with all
111070,111071,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.39,Third Gentleman,certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
111071,111072,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.2.40,Third Gentleman,the meeting of the two kings?
111072,111073,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.2.41,Second Gentleman,No.
111073,111074,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.42,Third Gentleman,"Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,"
111074,111075,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.43,Third Gentleman,cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
111075,111076,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.44,Third Gentleman,"joy crown another, so and in such manner that it"
111076,111077,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.45,Third Gentleman,"seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their"
111077,111078,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.46,Third Gentleman,"joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,"
111078,111079,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.47,Third Gentleman,"holding up of hands, with countenances of such"
111079,111080,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.48,Third Gentleman,"distraction that they were to be known by garment,"
111080,111081,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.49,Third Gentleman,"not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of"
111081,111082,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.50,Third Gentleman,"himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that"
111082,111083,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.51,Third Gentleman,"joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,"
111083,111084,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.52,Third Gentleman,"thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness, then"
111084,111085,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.53,Third Gentleman,"embraces his son-in-law, then again worries he his"
111085,111086,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.54,Third Gentleman,"daughter with clipping her, now he thanks the old"
111086,111087,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.55,Third Gentleman,"shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten"
111087,111088,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.56,Third Gentleman,conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
111088,111089,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.57,Third Gentleman,"another encounter, which lames report to follow it"
111089,111090,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.2.58,Third Gentleman,and undoes description to do it.
111090,111091,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.2.59,Second Gentleman,"What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried"
111091,111092,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.2.60,Second Gentleman,hence the child?
111092,111093,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.61,Third Gentleman,"Like an old tale still, which will have matter to"
111093,111094,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.62,Third Gentleman,"rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear"
111094,111095,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.63,Third Gentleman,open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
111095,111096,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.64,Third Gentleman,"avouches the shepherd's son, who has not only his"
111096,111097,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.65,Third Gentleman,"innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a"
111097,111098,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.2.66,Third Gentleman,handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
111098,111099,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.2.67,First Gentleman,What became of his bark and his followers?
111099,111100,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.68,Third Gentleman,Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
111100,111101,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.69,Third Gentleman,in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
111101,111102,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.70,Third Gentleman,instruments which aided to expose the child were
111102,111103,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.71,Third Gentleman,"even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble"
111103,111104,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.72,Third Gentleman,combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
111104,111105,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.73,Third Gentleman,Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
111105,111106,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.74,Third Gentleman,"her husband, another elevated that the oracle was"
111106,111107,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.75,Third Gentleman,"fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,"
111107,111108,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.76,Third Gentleman,"and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin"
111108,111109,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.77,Third Gentleman,her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
111109,111110,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.2.78,Third Gentleman,of losing.
111110,111111,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.2.79,First Gentleman,The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
111111,111112,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.2.80,First Gentleman,"kings and princes, for by such was it acted."
111112,111113,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.81,Third Gentleman,One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
111113,111114,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.82,Third Gentleman,"angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not"
111114,111115,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.83,Third Gentleman,"the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's"

111116,111117,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.85,Third Gentleman,"confessed and lamented by the king, how"
111117,111118,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.86,Third Gentleman,"attentiveness wounded his daughter, till, from one"
111118,111119,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.87,Third Gentleman,"sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'"
111119,111120,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.88,Third Gentleman,"I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my"
111120,111121,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.89,Third Gentleman,heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
111121,111122,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.90,Third Gentleman,"colour, some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world"
111122,111123,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.2.91,Third Gentleman,"could have seen 't, the woe had been universal."
111123,111124,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.2.92,First Gentleman,Are they returned to the court?
111124,111125,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.93,Third Gentleman,"No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,"
111125,111126,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.94,Third Gentleman,"which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many"

111132,111133,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.101,Third Gentleman,answer: thither with all greediness of affection
111133,111134,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.2.102,Third Gentleman,"are they gone, and there they intend to sup."
111134,111135,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.2.103,Second Gentleman,"I thought she had some great matter there in hand,"
111135,111136,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.2.104,Second Gentleman,"for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever"

111140,111141,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.2.109,First Gentleman,every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
111141,111142,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.2.110,First Gentleman,our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
111142,111143,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.2.111,First Gentleman,Let's along.
111143,111144,A Winters Tale,18.0,,First Gentleman,Exeunt Gentlemen

111145,111146,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.113,AUTOLYCUS,would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
111146,111147,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.114,AUTOLYCUS,man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
111147,111148,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.115,AUTOLYCUS,them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
111148,111149,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.116,AUTOLYCUS,"at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,"
111149,111150,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.2.117,AUTOLYCUS,"so he then took her to be, who began to be much"

111161,111162,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.128,Clown,"this other day, because I was no gentleman born."
111162,111163,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.129,Clown,See you these clothes? say you see them not and
111163,111164,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.130,Clown,think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
111164,111165,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.131,Clown,these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
111165,111166,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.2.132,Clown,"lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born."
111166,111167,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.2.133,AUTOLYCUS,"I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born."
111167,111168,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.2.134,Clown,"Ay, and have been so any time these four hours."
111168,111169,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.2.135,Shepherd,"And so have I, boy."
111169,111170,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.136,Clown,So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
111170,111171,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.137,Clown,"father, for the king's son took me by the hand, and"
111171,111172,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.138,Clown,"called me brother, and then the two kings called my"
111172,111173,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.139,Clown,"father brother, and then the prince my brother and"
111173,111174,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.140,Clown,"the princess my sister called my father father, and"
111174,111175,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.141,Clown,"so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like"
111175,111176,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.2.142,Clown,tears that ever we shed.
111176,111177,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.2.143,Shepherd,"We may live, son, to shed many more."
111177,111178,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.2.144,Clown,"Ay, or else 'twere hard luck, being in so"
111178,111179,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.2.145,Clown,preposterous estate as we are.
111179,111180,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.2.146,AUTOLYCUS,"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the"
111180,111181,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.2.147,AUTOLYCUS,faults I have committed to your worship and to give
111181,111182,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.2.148,AUTOLYCUS,me your good report to the prince my master.
111182,111183,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.2.149,Shepherd,"Prithee, son, do, for we must be gentle, now we are"
111183,111184,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.2.150,Shepherd,gentlemen.
111184,111185,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.2.151,Clown,Thou wilt amend thy life?
111185,111186,A Winters Tale,31.0,5.2.152,AUTOLYCUS,"Ay, an it like your good worship."
111186,111187,A Winters Tale,32.0,5.2.153,Clown,Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
111187,111188,A Winters Tale,32.0,5.2.154,Clown,art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
111188,111189,A Winters Tale,33.0,5.2.155,Shepherd,"You may say it, but not swear it."
111189,111190,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.2.156,Clown,"Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and"
111190,111191,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.2.157,Clown,"franklins say it, I'll swear it."
111191,111192,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.2.158,Shepherd,"How if it be false, son?"
111192,111193,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.159,Clown,"If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear"
111193,111194,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.160,Clown,it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
111194,111195,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.161,Clown,the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
111195,111196,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.162,Clown,"that thou wilt not be drunk, but I know thou art no"
111196,111197,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.163,Clown,tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
111197,111198,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.164,Clown,"drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst"
111198,111199,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.2.165,Clown,be a tall fellow of thy hands.
111199,111200,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.2.166,AUTOLYCUS,"I will prove so, sir, to my power."
111200,111201,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.167,Clown,"Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not"
111201,111202,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.168,Clown,"wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not"
111202,111203,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.169,Clown,"being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings"
111203,111204,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.170,Clown,"and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the"
111204,111205,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.2.171,Clown,"queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy"

111208,111209,A Winters Tale,38.0,,Clown,"Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants"
111209,111210,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.3.1,LEONTES,"O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort"
111210,111211,A Winters Tale,1.0,5.3.2,LEONTES,That I have had of thee!
111211,111212,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.3,PAULINA,"What, sovereign sir,"
111212,111213,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.4,PAULINA,I did not well I meant well. All my services
111213,111214,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.5,PAULINA,"You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,"
111214,111215,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.6,PAULINA,With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
111215,111216,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.7,PAULINA,"Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,"
111216,111217,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.8,PAULINA,"It is a surplus of your grace, which never"
111217,111218,A Winters Tale,2.0,5.3.9,PAULINA,My life may last to answer.
111218,111219,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.10,LEONTES,"O Paulina,"
111219,111220,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.11,LEONTES,We honour you with trouble: but we came
111220,111221,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.12,LEONTES,To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
111221,111222,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.13,LEONTES,"Have we pass'd through, not without much content"
111222,111223,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.14,LEONTES,"In many singularities, but we saw not"
111223,111224,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.15,LEONTES,"That which my daughter came to look upon,"
111224,111225,A Winters Tale,3.0,5.3.16,LEONTES,The statue of her mother.
111225,111226,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.17,PAULINA,"As she lived peerless,"
111226,111227,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.18,PAULINA,"So her dead likeness, I do well believe,"
111227,111228,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.19,PAULINA,Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
111228,111229,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.20,PAULINA,"Or hand of man hath done, therefore I keep it"
111229,111230,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.21,PAULINA,"Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare"
111230,111231,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.22,PAULINA,To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
111231,111232,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.23,PAULINA,"Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well."
111232,111233,A Winters Tale,4.0,,PAULINA,"PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue"
111233,111234,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.24,PAULINA,"I like your silence, it the more shows off"
111234,111235,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.25,PAULINA,"Your wonder: but yet speak, first, you, my liege,"
111235,111236,A Winters Tale,4.0,5.3.26,PAULINA,Comes it not something near?
111236,111237,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.27,LEONTES,Her natural posture!
111237,111238,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.28,LEONTES,"Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed"
111238,111239,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.29,LEONTES,"Thou art Hermione, or rather, thou art she"
111239,111240,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.30,LEONTES,"In thy not chiding, for she was as tender"
111240,111241,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.31,LEONTES,"As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,"
111241,111242,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.32,LEONTES,"Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing"
111242,111243,A Winters Tale,5.0,5.3.33,LEONTES,So aged as this seems.
111243,111244,A Winters Tale,6.0,5.3.34,POLIXENES,"O, not by much."
111244,111245,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.3.35,PAULINA,"So much the more our carver's excellence,"
111245,111246,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.3.36,PAULINA,Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
111246,111247,A Winters Tale,7.0,5.3.37,PAULINA,As she lived now.
111247,111248,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.38,LEONTES,"As now she might have done,"
111248,111249,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.39,LEONTES,"So much to my good comfort, as it is"
111249,111250,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.40,LEONTES,"Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,"
111250,111251,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.41,LEONTES,"Even with such life of majesty, warm life,"
111251,111252,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.42,LEONTES,"As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!"
111252,111253,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.43,LEONTES,I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
111253,111254,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.44,LEONTES,"For being more stone than it? O royal piece,"
111254,111255,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.45,LEONTES,"There's magic in thy majesty, which has"
111255,111256,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.46,LEONTES,My evils conjured to remembrance and
111256,111257,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.47,LEONTES,"From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,"
111257,111258,A Winters Tale,8.0,5.3.48,LEONTES,Standing like stone with thee.
111258,111259,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.49,PERDITA,"And give me leave,"
111259,111260,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.50,PERDITA,"And do not say 'tis superstition, that"
111260,111261,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.51,PERDITA,"I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,"
111261,111262,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.52,PERDITA,"Dear queen, that ended when I but began,"
111262,111263,A Winters Tale,9.0,5.3.53,PERDITA,Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
111263,111264,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.3.54,PAULINA,"O, patience!"
111264,111265,A Winters Tale,10.0,5.3.55,PAULINA,"The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry."
111265,111266,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.56,CAMILLO,"My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,"
111266,111267,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.57,CAMILLO,"Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,"
111267,111268,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.58,CAMILLO,"So many summers dry, scarce any joy"
111268,111269,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.59,CAMILLO,"Did ever so long live, no sorrow"
111269,111270,A Winters Tale,11.0,5.3.60,CAMILLO,But kill'd itself much sooner.
111270,111271,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.61,POLIXENES,"Dear my brother,"
111271,111272,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.62,POLIXENES,Let him that was the cause of this have power
111272,111273,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.63,POLIXENES,To take off so much grief from you as he
111273,111274,A Winters Tale,12.0,5.3.64,POLIXENES,Will piece up in himself.
111274,111275,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.65,PAULINA,"Indeed, my lord,"
111275,111276,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.66,PAULINA,If I had thought the sight of my poor image
111276,111277,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.67,PAULINA,"Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--"
111277,111278,A Winters Tale,13.0,5.3.68,PAULINA,I'ld not have show'd it.
111278,111279,A Winters Tale,14.0,5.3.69,LEONTES,Do not draw the curtain.
111279,111280,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.3.70,PAULINA,"No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy"
111280,111281,A Winters Tale,15.0,5.3.71,PAULINA,May think anon it moves.
111281,111282,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.72,LEONTES,"Let be, let be."
111282,111283,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.73,LEONTES,"Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--"
111283,111284,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.74,LEONTES,"What was he that did make it? See, my lord,"
111284,111285,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.75,LEONTES,Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
111285,111286,A Winters Tale,16.0,5.3.76,LEONTES,Did verily bear blood?
111286,111287,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.3.77,POLIXENES,Masterly done:
111287,111288,A Winters Tale,17.0,5.3.78,POLIXENES,The very life seems warm upon her lip.
111288,111289,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.3.79,LEONTES,"The fixture of her eye has motion in't,"
111289,111290,A Winters Tale,18.0,5.3.80,LEONTES,As we are mock'd with art.
111290,111291,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.3.81,PAULINA,I'll draw the curtain:
111291,111292,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.3.82,PAULINA,My lord's almost so far transported that
111292,111293,A Winters Tale,19.0,5.3.83,PAULINA,He'll think anon it lives.
111293,111294,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.84,LEONTES,"O sweet Paulina,"
111294,111295,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.85,LEONTES,Make me to think so twenty years together!
111295,111296,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.86,LEONTES,No settled senses of the world can match
111296,111297,A Winters Tale,20.0,5.3.87,LEONTES,The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
111297,111298,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.3.88,PAULINA,"I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but"
111298,111299,A Winters Tale,21.0,5.3.89,PAULINA,I could afflict you farther.
111299,111300,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.90,LEONTES,"Do, Paulina,"
111300,111301,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.91,LEONTES,For this affliction has a taste as sweet
111301,111302,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.92,LEONTES,"As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,"
111302,111303,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.93,LEONTES,There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
111303,111304,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.94,LEONTES,"Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,"
111304,111305,A Winters Tale,22.0,5.3.95,LEONTES,For I will kiss her.
111305,111306,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.96,PAULINA,"Good my lord, forbear:"
111306,111307,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.97,PAULINA,"The ruddiness upon her lip is wet,"
111307,111308,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.98,PAULINA,"You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own"
111308,111309,A Winters Tale,23.0,5.3.99,PAULINA,With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
111309,111310,A Winters Tale,24.0,5.3.100,LEONTES,"No, not these twenty years."
111310,111311,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.3.101,PERDITA,So long could I
111311,111312,A Winters Tale,25.0,5.3.102,PERDITA,"Stand by, a looker on."
111312,111313,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.103,PAULINA,"Either forbear,"
111313,111314,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.104,PAULINA,"Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you"
111314,111315,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.105,PAULINA,"For more amazement. If you can behold it,"
111315,111316,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.106,PAULINA,"I'll make the statue move indeed, descend"
111316,111317,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.107,PAULINA,"And take you by the hand, but then you'll think--"
111317,111318,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.108,PAULINA,Which I protest against--I am assisted
111318,111319,A Winters Tale,26.0,5.3.109,PAULINA,By wicked powers.
111319,111320,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.110,LEONTES,"What you can make her do,"
111320,111321,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.111,LEONTES,"I am content to look on: what to speak,"
111321,111322,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.112,LEONTES,"I am content to hear, for 'tis as easy"
111322,111323,A Winters Tale,27.0,5.3.113,LEONTES,To make her speak as move.
111323,111324,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.114,PAULINA,It is required
111324,111325,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.115,PAULINA,"You do awake your faith. Then all stand still,"
111325,111326,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.116,PAULINA,On: those that think it is unlawful business
111326,111327,A Winters Tale,28.0,5.3.117,PAULINA,"I am about, let them depart."
111327,111328,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.3.118,LEONTES,Proceed:
111328,111329,A Winters Tale,29.0,5.3.119,LEONTES,No foot shall stir.
111329,111330,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.120,PAULINA,"Music, awake her, strike!"
111330,111331,A Winters Tale,30.0,,PAULINA,Music
111331,111332,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.121,PAULINA,"'Tis time, descend, be stone no more, approach,"
111332,111333,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.122,PAULINA,"Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,"
111333,111334,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.123,PAULINA,"I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,"
111334,111335,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.124,PAULINA,"Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him"
111335,111336,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.125,PAULINA,Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:

111342,111343,A Winters Tale,30.0,5.3.131,PAULINA,Is she become the suitor?

111350,111351,A Winters Tale,34.0,5.3.139,POLIXENES,Or how stolen from the dead.
111351,111352,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.3.140,PAULINA,"That she is living,"
111352,111353,A Winters Tale,35.0,5.3.141,PAULINA,"Were it but told you, should be hooted at"

111359,111360,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.3.148,HERMIONE,And from your sacred vials pour your graces
111360,111361,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.3.149,HERMIONE,"Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own."
111361,111362,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.3.150,HERMIONE,Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
111362,111363,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.3.151,HERMIONE,"Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,"
111363,111364,A Winters Tale,36.0,5.3.152,HERMIONE,Knowing by Paulina that the oracle

111371,111372,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.3.160,PAULINA,Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
111372,111373,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.3.161,PAULINA,"My mate, that's never to be found again,"
111373,111374,A Winters Tale,37.0,5.3.162,PAULINA,Lament till I am lost.
111374,111375,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.163,LEONTES,"O, peace, Paulina!"
111375,111376,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.164,LEONTES,"Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,"

111380,111381,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.169,LEONTES,A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
111381,111382,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.170,LEONTES,"For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee"
111382,111383,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.171,LEONTES,"An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,"
111383,111384,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.172,LEONTES,"And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty"

111393,111394,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.182,LEONTES,Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
111394,111395,A Winters Tale,38.0,5.3.183,LEONTES,We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

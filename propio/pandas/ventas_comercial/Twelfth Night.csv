102907,102908,Twelfth Night,1.0,1.1.3,DUKE ORSINO,"The appetite may sicken, and so die."
102908,102909,Twelfth Night,1.0,1.1.4,DUKE ORSINO,That strain again! it had a dying fall:
102909,102910,Twelfth Night,1.0,1.1.5,DUKE ORSINO,"O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,"
102910,102911,Twelfth Night,1.0,1.1.6,DUKE ORSINO,"That breathes upon a bank of violets,"
102911,102912,Twelfth Night,1.0,1.1.7,DUKE ORSINO,"Stealing and giving odour! Enough, no more:"

102918,102919,Twelfth Night,1.0,1.1.14,DUKE ORSINO,Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
102919,102920,Twelfth Night,1.0,1.1.15,DUKE ORSINO,That it alone is high fantastical.
102920,102921,Twelfth Night,2.0,1.1.16,CURIO,"Will you go hunt, my lord?"

102926,102927,Twelfth Night,5.0,1.1.22,DUKE ORSINO,"That instant was I turn'd into a hart,"
102927,102928,Twelfth Night,5.0,1.1.23,DUKE ORSINO,"And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,"

102936,102937,Twelfth Night,6.0,1.1.31,VALENTINE,And water once a day her chamber round
102937,102938,Twelfth Night,6.0,1.1.32,VALENTINE,With eye-offending brine: all this to season
102938,102939,Twelfth Night,6.0,1.1.33,VALENTINE,"A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh"
102939,102940,Twelfth Night,6.0,1.1.34,VALENTINE,And lasting in her sad remembrance.
102940,102941,Twelfth Night,7.0,1.1.35,DUKE ORSINO,"O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame"
102941,102942,Twelfth Night,7.0,1.1.36,DUKE ORSINO,"To pay this debt of love but to a brother,"
102942,102943,Twelfth Night,7.0,1.1.37,DUKE ORSINO,"How will she love, when the rich golden shaft"

102947,102948,Twelfth Night,7.0,1.1.42,DUKE ORSINO,Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
102948,102949,Twelfth Night,7.0,1.1.43,DUKE ORSINO,Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

102954,102955,Twelfth Night,3.0,1.2.3,VIOLA,And what should I do in Illyria?
102955,102956,Twelfth Night,3.0,1.2.4,VIOLA,My brother he is in Elysium.
102956,102957,Twelfth Night,3.0,1.2.5,VIOLA,"Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?"
102957,102958,Twelfth Night,4.0,1.2.6,Captain,It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
102958,102959,Twelfth Night,5.0,1.2.7,VIOLA,O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
102959,102960,Twelfth Night,6.0,1.2.8,Captain,"True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,"

102968,102969,Twelfth Night,6.0,1.2.17,Captain,So long as I could see.
102969,102970,Twelfth Night,7.0,1.2.18,VIOLA,"For saying so, there's gold:"

102979,102980,Twelfth Night,13.0,1.2.28,VIOLA,Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
102980,102981,Twelfth Night,13.0,1.2.29,VIOLA,He was a bachelor then.
102981,102982,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.30,Captain,"And so is now, or was so very late,"
102982,102983,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.31,Captain,"For but a month ago I went from hence,"
102983,102984,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.32,Captain,"And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,"
102984,102985,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.33,Captain,"What great ones do the less will prattle of,--"
102985,102986,Twelfth Night,14.0,1.2.34,Captain,That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
102986,102987,Twelfth Night,15.0,1.2.35,VIOLA,What's she?
102987,102988,Twelfth Night,16.0,1.2.36,Captain,"A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count"

102996,102997,Twelfth Night,17.0,1.2.45,VIOLA,What my estate is!

102998,102999,Twelfth Night,18.0,1.2.47,Captain,"Because she will admit no kind of suit,"
102999,103000,Twelfth Night,18.0,1.2.48,Captain,"No, not the duke's."
103000,103001,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.49,VIOLA,"There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,"
103001,103002,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.50,VIOLA,And though that nature with a beauteous wall
103002,103003,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.51,VIOLA,"Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee"
103003,103004,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.52,VIOLA,I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
103004,103005,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.53,VIOLA,With this thy fair and outward character.
103005,103006,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.54,VIOLA,"I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,"

103007,103008,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.56,VIOLA,For such disguise as haply shall become

103011,103012,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.60,VIOLA,And speak to him in many sorts of music
103012,103013,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.61,VIOLA,That will allow me very worth his service.
103013,103014,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.62,VIOLA,"What else may hap to time I will commit,"
103014,103015,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.63,VIOLA,Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
103015,103016,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.2.64,Captain,"Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:"
103016,103017,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.2.65,Captain,"When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see."
103017,103018,Twelfth Night,21.0,1.2.66,VIOLA,I thank thee: lead me on.

103098,103099,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.76,SIR ANDREW,put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
103099,103100,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.77,SIR ANDREW,than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
103100,103101,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.78,SIR ANDREW,great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
103101,103102,Twelfth Night,44.0,1.3.79,SIR TOBY BELCH,No question.

103111,103112,Twelfth Night,50.0,1.3.89,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature."
103112,103113,Twelfth Night,51.0,1.3.90,SIR ANDREW,"But it becomes me well enough, does't not?"

103116,103117,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.94,SIR ANDREW,"Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece"
103117,103118,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.95,SIR ANDREW,"will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one"
103118,103119,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.96,SIR ANDREW,she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.

103129,103130,Twelfth Night,57.0,1.3.107,SIR ANDREW,with an old man.

103135,103136,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.113,SIR TOBY BELCH,Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have

103137,103138,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.115,SIR TOBY BELCH,"take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost"

103140,103141,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.118,SIR TOBY BELCH,so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
103141,103142,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.119,SIR TOBY BELCH,dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?

103419,103420,Twelfth Night,92.0,1.5.204,OLIVIA,"A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it."
103420,103421,Twelfth Night,92.0,1.5.205,OLIVIA,Where lies your text?
103421,103422,Twelfth Night,93.0,1.5.206,VIOLA,In Orsino's bosom.
103422,103423,Twelfth Night,94.0,1.5.207,OLIVIA,In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
103423,103424,Twelfth Night,95.0,1.5.208,VIOLA,"To answer by the method, in the first of his heart."
103424,103425,Twelfth Night,96.0,1.5.209,OLIVIA,"O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?"
103425,103426,Twelfth Night,97.0,1.5.210,VIOLA,"Good madam, let me see your face."
103426,103427,Twelfth Night,98.0,1.5.211,OLIVIA,Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
103427,103428,Twelfth Night,98.0,1.5.212,OLIVIA,with my face? You are now out of your text: but

103453,103454,Twelfth Night,105.0,1.5.237,VIOLA,"With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire."
103454,103455,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.238,OLIVIA,"Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:"
103455,103456,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.239,OLIVIA,"Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,"
103456,103457,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.240,OLIVIA,"Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth,"
103457,103458,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.241,OLIVIA,"In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant,"

103460,103461,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.244,OLIVIA,He might have took his answer long ago.

103465,103466,Twelfth Night,108.0,1.5.249,OLIVIA,"Why, what would you?"
103466,103467,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.250,VIOLA,"Make me a willow cabin at your gate,"
103467,103468,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.251,VIOLA,"And call upon my soul within the house,"

103470,103471,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.254,VIOLA,Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
103471,103472,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.255,VIOLA,And make the babbling gossip of the air
103472,103473,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.256,VIOLA,"Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest"

103475,103476,Twelfth Night,110.0,1.5.259,OLIVIA,You might do much.
103476,103477,Twelfth Night,110.0,1.5.260,OLIVIA,What is your parentage?
103477,103478,Twelfth Night,111.0,1.5.261,VIOLA,"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:"
103478,103479,Twelfth Night,111.0,1.5.262,VIOLA,I am a gentleman.
103479,103480,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.263,OLIVIA,"Get you to your lord,"
103480,103481,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.264,OLIVIA,"I cannot love him: let him send no more,"
103481,103482,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.265,OLIVIA,"Unless, perchance, you come to me again,"
103482,103483,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.266,OLIVIA,To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
103483,103484,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.267,OLIVIA,I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
103484,103485,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.268,VIOLA,"I am no fee'd post, lady, keep your purse:"
103485,103486,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.269,VIOLA,"My master, not myself, lacks recompense."
103486,103487,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.270,VIOLA,"Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,"
103487,103488,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.271,VIOLA,"And let your fervor, like my master's, be"
103488,103489,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.272,VIOLA,"Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty."

103496,103497,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.279,OLIVIA,Unless the master were the man. How now!
103497,103498,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.280,OLIVIA,Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
103498,103499,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.281,OLIVIA,Methinks I feel this youth's perfections

103506,103507,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.288,OLIVIA,Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
103507,103508,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.289,OLIVIA,"Desire him not to flatter with his lord,"

103521,103522,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.1.1,ANTONIO,Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
103522,103523,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.2,SEBASTIAN,"By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over"
103523,103524,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.3,SEBASTIAN,me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
103524,103525,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.4,SEBASTIAN,"distemper yours, therefore I shall crave of you your"
103525,103526,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.5,SEBASTIAN,leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
103526,103527,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.6,SEBASTIAN,"recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you."
103527,103528,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.7,SEBASTIAN,ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
103528,103529,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.8,SEBASTIAN,"No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere"
103529,103530,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.9,SEBASTIAN,extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
103530,103531,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.10,SEBASTIAN,"touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me"
103531,103532,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.11,SEBASTIAN,"what I am willing to keep in, therefore it charges"
103532,103533,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.12,SEBASTIAN,me in manners the rather to express myself. You
103533,103534,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.13,SEBASTIAN,"must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,"
103534,103535,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.14,SEBASTIAN,which I called Roderigo. My father was that

103536,103537,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.16,SEBASTIAN,"of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both"
103537,103538,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.17,SEBASTIAN,"born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,"
103538,103539,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.18,SEBASTIAN,"would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that,"
103539,103540,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.19,SEBASTIAN,for some hour before you took me from the breach of
103540,103541,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.20,SEBASTIAN,the sea was my sister drowned.
103541,103542,Twelfth Night,4.0,2.1.21,ANTONIO,Alas the day!
103542,103543,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.22,SEBASTIAN,"A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled"
103543,103544,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.23,SEBASTIAN,"me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,"
103544,103545,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.24,SEBASTIAN,though I could not with such estimable wonder
103545,103546,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.25,SEBASTIAN,"overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly"
103546,103547,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.26,SEBASTIAN,"publish her, she bore a mind that envy could not but"
103547,103548,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.27,SEBASTIAN,"call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt"
103548,103549,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.28,SEBASTIAN,"water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more."
103549,103550,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.1.29,ANTONIO,"Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment."
103550,103551,Twelfth Night,7.0,2.1.30,SEBASTIAN,"O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble."

103554,103555,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.34,SEBASTIAN,"kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not."
103555,103556,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.35,SEBASTIAN,"Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,"
103556,103557,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.36,SEBASTIAN,"and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that"
103557,103558,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.37,SEBASTIAN,upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
103558,103559,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.38,SEBASTIAN,tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

103562,103563,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.1.41,ANTONIO,Else would I very shortly see thee there.
103563,103564,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.1.42,ANTONIO,"But, come what may, I do adore thee so,"
103564,103565,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.1.43,ANTONIO,"That danger shall seem sport, and I will go."
103565,103566,Twelfth Night,10.0,,ANTONIO,Exit

103805,103806,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.3,DUKE ORSINO,That old and antique song we heard last night:
103806,103807,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.4,DUKE ORSINO,"Methought it did relieve my passion much,"
103807,103808,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.5,DUKE ORSINO,More than light airs and recollected terms
103808,103809,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.6,DUKE ORSINO,Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
103809,103810,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.7,DUKE ORSINO,"Come, but one verse."
103810,103811,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.4.8,CURIO,"He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it."

103822,103823,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.4.19,VIOLA,It gives a very echo to the seat

103824,103825,Twelfth Night,7.0,2.4.21,DUKE ORSINO,Thou dost speak masterly:

103828,103829,Twelfth Night,8.0,2.4.25,VIOLA,"A little, by your favour."
103829,103830,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.4.26,DUKE ORSINO,What kind of woman is't?
103830,103831,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.4.27,VIOLA,Of your complexion.

103835,103836,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.32,DUKE ORSINO,So sways she level in her husband's heart:
103836,103837,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.33,DUKE ORSINO,"For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,"
103837,103838,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.34,DUKE ORSINO,"Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,"
103838,103839,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.35,DUKE ORSINO,"More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,"
103839,103840,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.36,DUKE ORSINO,Than women's are.
103840,103841,Twelfth Night,14.0,2.4.37,VIOLA,"I think it well, my lord."
103841,103842,Twelfth Night,15.0,2.4.38,DUKE ORSINO,"Then let thy love be younger than thyself,"
103842,103843,Twelfth Night,15.0,2.4.39,DUKE ORSINO,"Or thy affection cannot hold the bent,"
103843,103844,Twelfth Night,15.0,2.4.40,DUKE ORSINO,"For women are as roses, whose fair flower"

103850,103851,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.46,DUKE ORSINO,The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
103851,103852,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.47,DUKE ORSINO,And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
103852,103853,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.48,DUKE ORSINO,"Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,"
103853,103854,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.49,DUKE ORSINO,"And dallies with the innocence of love,"
103854,103855,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.50,DUKE ORSINO,Like the old age.

103923,103924,Twelfth Night,36.0,2.4.116,VIOLA,"A blank, my lord. She never told her love,"
103924,103925,Twelfth Night,36.0,2.4.117,VIOLA,"But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,"

104169,104170,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.1.19,Clown,word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
104170,104171,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.1.20,Clown,are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
104171,104172,Twelfth Night,11.0,3.1.21,VIOLA,"Thy reason, man?"
104172,104173,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.1.22,Clown,"Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and"

104202,104203,Twelfth Night,25.0,3.1.51,VIOLA,"I understand you, sir, 'tis well begged."

104210,104211,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.58,VIOLA,And to do that well craves a kind of wit:

104212,104213,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.60,VIOLA,"The quality of persons, and the time,"

104216,104217,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.64,VIOLA,"For folly that he wisely shows is fit,"
104217,104218,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.65,VIOLA,"But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit."

104274,104275,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.119,OLIVIA,"Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak."
104275,104276,Twelfth Night,53.0,3.1.120,VIOLA,I pity you.
104276,104277,Twelfth Night,54.0,3.1.121,OLIVIA,That's a degree to love.
104277,104278,Twelfth Night,55.0,3.1.122,VIOLA,"No, not a grize, for 'tis a vulgar proof,"
104278,104279,Twelfth Night,55.0,3.1.123,VIOLA,That very oft we pity enemies.
104279,104280,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.124,OLIVIA,"Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again."
104280,104281,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.125,OLIVIA,"O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!"
104281,104282,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.126,OLIVIA,"If one should be a prey, how much the better"
104282,104283,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.127,OLIVIA,To fall before the lion than the wolf!
104283,104284,Twelfth Night,56.0,,OLIVIA,Clock strikes

104286,104287,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.130,OLIVIA,"And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,"
104287,104288,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.131,OLIVIA,Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
104288,104289,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.132,OLIVIA,"There lies your way, due west."
104289,104290,Twelfth Night,57.0,3.1.133,VIOLA,Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition

104294,104295,Twelfth Night,59.0,3.1.138,VIOLA,That you do think you are not what you are.
104295,104296,Twelfth Night,60.0,3.1.139,OLIVIA,"If I think so, I think the same of you."
104296,104297,Twelfth Night,61.0,3.1.140,VIOLA,Then think you right: I am not what I am.
104297,104298,Twelfth Night,62.0,3.1.141,OLIVIA,I would you were as I would have you be!
104298,104299,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.1.142,VIOLA,"Would it be better, madam, than I am?"
104299,104300,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.1.143,VIOLA,"I wish it might, for now I am your fool."
104300,104301,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.144,OLIVIA,"O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful"
104301,104302,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.145,OLIVIA,In the contempt and anger of his lip!

104303,104304,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.147,OLIVIA,Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
104304,104305,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.148,OLIVIA,"Cesario, by the roses of the spring,"
104305,104306,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.149,OLIVIA,"By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,"
104306,104307,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.150,OLIVIA,"I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,"
104307,104308,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.151,OLIVIA,Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
104308,104309,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.152,OLIVIA,"Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,"
104309,104310,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.153,OLIVIA,"For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,"
104310,104311,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.154,OLIVIA,"But rather reason thus with reason fetter,"
104311,104312,Twelfth Night,64.0,3.1.155,OLIVIA,"Love sought is good, but given unsought better."
104312,104313,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.156,VIOLA,"By innocence I swear, and by my youth"
104313,104314,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.157,VIOLA,"I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,"
104314,104315,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.158,VIOLA,"And that no woman has, nor never none"
104315,104316,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.159,VIOLA,"Shall mistress be of it, save I alone."
104316,104317,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.160,VIOLA,"And so adieu, good madam: never more"
104317,104318,Twelfth Night,65.0,3.1.161,VIOLA,Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
104318,104319,Twelfth Night,66.0,3.1.162,OLIVIA,"Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move"
104319,104320,Twelfth Night,66.0,3.1.163,OLIVIA,"That heart, which now abhors, to like his love."

104329,104330,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.2.7,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that."
104330,104331,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.2.8,SIR ANDREW,As plain as I see you now.
104331,104332,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.2.9,FABIAN,This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
104332,104333,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.2.10,SIR ANDREW,"'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?"
104333,104334,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.2.11,FABIAN,"I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of"
104334,104335,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.2.12,FABIAN,judgment and reason.
104335,104336,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.2.13,SIR TOBY BELCH,And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah

104342,104343,Twelfth Night,11.0,3.2.20,FABIAN,have banged the youth into dumbness. This was

104348,104349,Twelfth Night,11.0,3.2.26,FABIAN,some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
104349,104350,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.2.27,SIR ANDREW,"An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy"
104350,104351,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.2.28,SIR ANDREW,I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a

104355,104356,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.2.33,SIR TOBY BELCH,"take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no"

104357,104358,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.2.35,SIR TOBY BELCH,commendation with woman than report of valour.
104358,104359,Twelfth Night,14.0,3.2.36,FABIAN,"There is no way but this, Sir Andrew."
104359,104360,Twelfth Night,15.0,3.2.37,SIR ANDREW,Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
104360,104361,Twelfth Night,16.0,3.2.38,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief,"

104369,104370,Twelfth Night,17.0,3.2.47,SIR ANDREW,Where shall I find you?
104370,104371,Twelfth Night,18.0,3.2.48,SIR TOBY BELCH,We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.

104375,104376,Twelfth Night,21.0,3.2.52,FABIAN,We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
104376,104377,Twelfth Night,21.0,3.2.53,FABIAN,not deliver't?
104377,104378,Twelfth Night,22.0,3.2.54,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Never trust me, then, and by all means stir on the"
104378,104379,Twelfth Night,22.0,3.2.55,SIR TOBY BELCH,youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
104379,104380,Twelfth Night,22.0,3.2.56,SIR TOBY BELCH,"cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were"
104380,104381,Twelfth Night,22.0,3.2.57,SIR TOBY BELCH,"opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as"

104388,104389,Twelfth Night,25.0,3.2.64,MARIA,"into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is"

104393,104394,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.2.69,SIR TOBY BELCH,And cross-gartered?
104394,104395,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.70,MARIA,"Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school"
104395,104396,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.71,MARIA,"i' the church. I have dogged him, like his"
104396,104397,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.72,MARIA,murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
104397,104398,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.73,MARIA,that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
104398,104399,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.74,MARIA,face into more lines than is in the new map with the
104399,104400,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.75,MARIA,augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
104400,104401,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.76,MARIA,a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
104401,104402,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.77,MARIA,"at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,"
104402,104403,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.2.78,MARIA,he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
104403,104404,Twelfth Night,28.0,3.2.79,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Come, bring us, bring us where he is."

104408,104409,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.3.2,SEBASTIAN,"But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,"
104409,104410,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.3.3,SEBASTIAN,I will no further chide you.
104410,104411,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.3.4,ANTONIO,"I could not stay behind you: my desire,"
104411,104412,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.3.5,ANTONIO,"More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth,"
104412,104413,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.3.6,ANTONIO,"And not all love to see you, though so much"
104413,104414,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.3.7,ANTONIO,"As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,"
104414,104415,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.3.8,ANTONIO,"But jealousy what might befall your travel,"
104415,104416,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.3.9,ANTONIO,"Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger,"

104417,104418,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.3.11,ANTONIO,"Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,"

104420,104421,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.3.14,SEBASTIAN,"My kind Antonio,"
104421,104422,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.3.15,SEBASTIAN,"I can no other answer make but thanks,"

104424,104425,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.3.18,SEBASTIAN,"But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,"
104425,104426,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.3.19,SEBASTIAN,You should find better dealing. What's to do?
104426,104427,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.3.20,SEBASTIAN,Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
104427,104428,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.3.21,ANTONIO,"To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging."

104432,104433,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.26,ANTONIO,"Would you'ld pardon me,"
104433,104434,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.27,ANTONIO,I do not without danger walk these streets:
104434,104435,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.3.28,ANTONIO,"Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys"

104438,104439,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.32,ANTONIO,"The offence is not of such a bloody nature,"
104439,104440,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.33,ANTONIO,Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
104440,104441,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.34,ANTONIO,Might well have given us bloody argument.
104441,104442,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.35,ANTONIO,It might have since been answer'd in repaying
104442,104443,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.3.36,ANTONIO,"What we took from them, which, for traffic's sake,"

105126,105127,Twelfth Night,9.0,5.1.11,Clown,for my friends.
105127,105128,Twelfth Night,10.0,5.1.12,DUKE ORSINO,"Just the contrary, the better for thy friends."
105128,105129,Twelfth Night,11.0,5.1.13,Clown,"No, sir, the worse."
105129,105130,Twelfth Night,12.0,5.1.14,DUKE ORSINO,How can that be?
105130,105131,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.15,Clown,"Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me,"
105131,105132,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.16,Clown,now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
105132,105133,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.17,Clown,"my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,"
105133,105134,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.18,Clown,"and by my friends, I am abused: so that,"
105134,105135,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.19,Clown,"conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives"
105135,105136,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.20,Clown,"make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for"
105136,105137,Twelfth Night,13.0,5.1.21,Clown,my friends and the better for my foes.
105137,105138,Twelfth Night,14.0,5.1.22,DUKE ORSINO,"Why, this is excellent."
105138,105139,Twelfth Night,15.0,5.1.23,Clown,"By my troth, sir, no, though it please you to be"
105139,105140,Twelfth Night,15.0,5.1.24,Clown,one of my friends.
105140,105141,Twelfth Night,16.0,5.1.25,DUKE ORSINO,Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
105141,105142,Twelfth Night,17.0,5.1.26,Clown,"But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would"
105142,105143,Twelfth Night,17.0,5.1.27,Clown,you could make it another.
105143,105144,Twelfth Night,18.0,5.1.28,DUKE ORSINO,"O, you give me ill counsel."
105144,105145,Twelfth Night,19.0,5.1.29,Clown,"Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,"
105145,105146,Twelfth Night,19.0,5.1.30,Clown,and let your flesh and blood obey it.
105146,105147,Twelfth Night,20.0,5.1.31,DUKE ORSINO,"Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a"
105147,105148,Twelfth Night,20.0,5.1.32,DUKE ORSINO,double-dealer: there's another.
105148,105149,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.33,Clown,"Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the old"
105149,105150,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.34,Clown,"saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,"
105150,105151,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.35,Clown,"sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of"
105151,105152,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.36,Clown,"Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind, one, two, three."
105152,105153,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.37,DUKE ORSINO,You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
105153,105154,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.38,DUKE ORSINO,if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
105154,105155,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.39,DUKE ORSINO,"with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake"

105157,105158,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.42,Clown,"again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think"
105158,105159,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.43,Clown,that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
105159,105160,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.44,Clown,"but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I"
105160,105161,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.45,Clown,will awake it anon.
105161,105162,Twelfth Night,23.0,,Clown,Exit
105162,105163,Twelfth Night,24.0,5.1.46,VIOLA,"Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me."
105163,105164,Twelfth Night,24.0,,VIOLA,Enter ANTONIO and Officers
105164,105165,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.47,DUKE ORSINO,"That face of his I do remember well,"
105165,105166,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.48,DUKE ORSINO,"Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd"
105166,105167,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.49,DUKE ORSINO,As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
105167,105168,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.50,DUKE ORSINO,"A bawbling vessel was he captain of,"
105168,105169,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.51,DUKE ORSINO,"For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,"
105169,105170,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.52,DUKE ORSINO,With which such scathful grapple did he make
105170,105171,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.53,DUKE ORSINO,"With the most noble bottom of our fleet,"
105171,105172,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.54,DUKE ORSINO,That very envy and the tongue of loss
105172,105173,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.55,DUKE ORSINO,Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
105173,105174,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.56,First Officer,"Orsino, this is that Antonio"
105174,105175,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.57,First Officer,"That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,"
105175,105176,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.58,First Officer,"And this is he that did the Tiger board,"
105176,105177,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.59,First Officer,When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
105177,105178,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.60,First Officer,"Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,"
105178,105179,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.61,First Officer,In private brabble did we apprehend him.
105179,105180,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.62,VIOLA,"He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,"
105180,105181,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.63,VIOLA,But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
105181,105182,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.64,VIOLA,I know not what 'twas but distraction.
105182,105183,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.65,DUKE ORSINO,Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
105183,105184,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.66,DUKE ORSINO,"What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,"
105184,105185,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.67,DUKE ORSINO,"Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,"
105185,105186,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.68,DUKE ORSINO,Hast made thine enemies?
105186,105187,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.69,ANTONIO,"Orsino, noble sir,"
105187,105188,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.70,ANTONIO,Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
105188,105189,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.71,ANTONIO,"Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,"
105189,105190,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.72,ANTONIO,"Though I confess, on base and ground enough,"
105190,105191,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.73,ANTONIO,Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
105191,105192,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.74,ANTONIO,"That most ingrateful boy there by your side,"
105192,105193,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.75,ANTONIO,From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
105193,105194,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.76,ANTONIO,"Did I redeem, a wreck past hope he was:"
105194,105195,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.77,ANTONIO,His life I gave him and did thereto add
105195,105196,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.78,ANTONIO,"My love, without retention or restraint,"
105196,105197,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.79,ANTONIO,"All his in dedication, for his sake"
105197,105198,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.80,ANTONIO,"Did I expose myself, pure for his love,"
105198,105199,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.81,ANTONIO,"Into the danger of this adverse town,"
105199,105200,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.82,ANTONIO,Drew to defend him when he was beset:
105200,105201,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.83,ANTONIO,"Where being apprehended, his false cunning,"
105201,105202,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.84,ANTONIO,"Not meaning to partake with me in danger,"
105202,105203,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.85,ANTONIO,"Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,"
105203,105204,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.86,ANTONIO,And grew a twenty years removed thing
105204,105205,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.87,ANTONIO,"While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,"
105205,105206,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.88,ANTONIO,Which I had recommended to his use
105206,105207,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.89,ANTONIO,Not half an hour before.
105207,105208,Twelfth Night,30.0,5.1.90,VIOLA,How can this be?
105208,105209,Twelfth Night,31.0,5.1.91,DUKE ORSINO,When came he to this town?
105209,105210,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.92,ANTONIO,"To-day, my lord, and for three months before,"
105210,105211,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.93,ANTONIO,"No interim, not a minute's vacancy,"
105211,105212,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.94,ANTONIO,Both day and night did we keep company.
105212,105213,Twelfth Night,32.0,,ANTONIO,Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
105213,105214,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.95,DUKE ORSINO,Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
105214,105215,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.96,DUKE ORSINO,"But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness:"
105215,105216,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.97,DUKE ORSINO,"Three months this youth hath tended upon me,"
105216,105217,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.98,DUKE ORSINO,But more of that anon. Take him aside.
105217,105218,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.99,OLIVIA,"What would my lord, but that he may not have,"
105218,105219,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.100,OLIVIA,Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
105219,105220,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.101,OLIVIA,"Cesario, you do not keep promise with me."
105220,105221,Twelfth Night,35.0,5.1.102,VIOLA,Madam!
105221,105222,Twelfth Night,36.0,5.1.103,DUKE ORSINO,"Gracious Olivia,--"
105222,105223,Twelfth Night,37.0,5.1.104,OLIVIA,"What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--"
105223,105224,Twelfth Night,38.0,5.1.105,VIOLA,"My lord would speak, my duty hushes me."
105224,105225,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.106,OLIVIA,"If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,"
105225,105226,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.107,OLIVIA,It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
105226,105227,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.108,OLIVIA,As howling after music.
105227,105228,Twelfth Night,40.0,5.1.109,DUKE ORSINO,Still so cruel?
105228,105229,Twelfth Night,41.0,5.1.110,OLIVIA,"Still so constant, lord."
105229,105230,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.111,DUKE ORSINO,"What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,"
105230,105231,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.112,DUKE ORSINO,To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
105231,105232,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.113,DUKE ORSINO,My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
105232,105233,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.114,DUKE ORSINO,That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
105233,105234,Twelfth Night,43.0,5.1.115,OLIVIA,"Even what it please my lord, that shall become him."
105234,105235,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.116,DUKE ORSINO,"Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,"
105235,105236,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.117,DUKE ORSINO,"Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,"
105236,105237,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.118,DUKE ORSINO,Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
105237,105238,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.119,DUKE ORSINO,That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
105238,105239,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.120,DUKE ORSINO,"Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,"
105239,105240,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.121,DUKE ORSINO,And that I partly know the instrument
105240,105241,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.122,DUKE ORSINO,"That screws me from my true place in your favour,"
105241,105242,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.123,DUKE ORSINO,"Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still,"
105242,105243,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.124,DUKE ORSINO,"But this your minion, whom I know you love,"
105243,105244,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.125,DUKE ORSINO,"And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,"
105244,105245,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.126,DUKE ORSINO,"Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,"
105245,105246,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.127,DUKE ORSINO,Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
105246,105247,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.128,DUKE ORSINO,"Come, boy, with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischief:"
105247,105248,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.129,DUKE ORSINO,"I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,"
105248,105249,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.130,DUKE ORSINO,To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
105249,105250,Twelfth Night,45.0,5.1.131,VIOLA,"And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,"
105250,105251,Twelfth Night,45.0,5.1.132,VIOLA,"To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die."
105251,105252,Twelfth Night,46.0,5.1.133,OLIVIA,Where goes Cesario?
105252,105253,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.134,VIOLA,After him I love
105253,105254,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.135,VIOLA,"More than I love these eyes, more than my life,"
105254,105255,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.136,VIOLA,"More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife."
105255,105256,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.137,VIOLA,"If I do feign, you witnesses above"
105256,105257,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.138,VIOLA,Punish my life for tainting of my love!
105257,105258,Twelfth Night,48.0,5.1.139,OLIVIA,"Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!"
105258,105259,Twelfth Night,49.0,5.1.140,VIOLA,Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
105259,105260,Twelfth Night,50.0,5.1.141,OLIVIA,Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?

105263,105264,Twelfth Night,53.0,5.1.145,DUKE ORSINO,Husband!
105264,105265,Twelfth Night,54.0,5.1.146,OLIVIA,"Ay, husband: can he that deny?"
105265,105266,Twelfth Night,55.0,5.1.147,DUKE ORSINO,"Her husband, sirrah!"
105266,105267,Twelfth Night,56.0,5.1.148,VIOLA,"No, my lord, not I."
105267,105268,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.149,OLIVIA,"Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear"
105268,105269,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.150,OLIVIA,That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
105269,105270,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.151,OLIVIA,"Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up,"
105270,105271,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.152,OLIVIA,"Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art"
105271,105272,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.153,OLIVIA,As great as that thou fear'st.

105299,105300,Twelfth Night,63.0,5.1.179,OLIVIA,What's the matter?
105300,105301,Twelfth Night,64.0,5.1.180,SIR ANDREW,He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
105301,105302,Twelfth Night,64.0,5.1.181,SIR ANDREW,"a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your"
105302,105303,Twelfth Night,64.0,5.1.182,SIR ANDREW,help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
105303,105304,Twelfth Night,65.0,5.1.183,OLIVIA,"Who has done this, Sir Andrew?"
105304,105305,Twelfth Night,66.0,5.1.184,SIR ANDREW,"The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for"
105305,105306,Twelfth Night,66.0,5.1.185,SIR ANDREW,"a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate."
105306,105307,Twelfth Night,67.0,5.1.186,DUKE ORSINO,"My gentleman, Cesario?"

105309,105310,Twelfth Night,68.0,5.1.189,SIR ANDREW,by Sir Toby.
105310,105311,Twelfth Night,69.0,5.1.190,VIOLA,Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
105311,105312,Twelfth Night,69.0,5.1.191,VIOLA,"You drew your sword upon me without cause,"
105312,105313,Twelfth Night,69.0,5.1.192,VIOLA,"But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not."
105313,105314,Twelfth Night,70.0,5.1.193,SIR ANDREW,"If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I"
105314,105315,Twelfth Night,70.0,5.1.194,SIR ANDREW,think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.

105323,105324,Twelfth Night,73.0,5.1.202,Clown,were set at eight i' the morning.
105324,105325,Twelfth Night,74.0,5.1.203,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I"

105326,105327,Twelfth Night,75.0,5.1.205,OLIVIA,Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
105327,105328,Twelfth Night,76.0,5.1.206,SIR ANDREW,"I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together."
105328,105329,Twelfth Night,77.0,5.1.207,SIR TOBY BELCH,Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a

105330,105331,Twelfth Night,78.0,5.1.209,OLIVIA,"Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to."
105331,105332,Twelfth Night,78.0,,OLIVIA,"Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW"

105333,105334,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.210,SEBASTIAN,"I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:"
105334,105335,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.211,SEBASTIAN,"But, had it been the brother of my blood,"
105335,105336,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.212,SEBASTIAN,I must have done no less with wit and safety.
105336,105337,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.213,SEBASTIAN,"You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that"
105337,105338,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.214,SEBASTIAN,I do perceive it hath offended you:
105338,105339,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.215,SEBASTIAN,"Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows"
105339,105340,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.216,SEBASTIAN,We made each other but so late ago.
105340,105341,Twelfth Night,80.0,5.1.217,DUKE ORSINO,"One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,"
105341,105342,Twelfth Night,80.0,5.1.218,DUKE ORSINO,"A natural perspective, that is and is not!"
105342,105343,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.219,SEBASTIAN,"Antonio, O my dear Antonio!"
105343,105344,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.220,SEBASTIAN,"How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,"
105344,105345,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.221,SEBASTIAN,Since I have lost thee!
105345,105346,Twelfth Night,82.0,5.1.222,ANTONIO,Sebastian are you?
105346,105347,Twelfth Night,83.0,5.1.223,SEBASTIAN,"Fear'st thou that, Antonio?"
105347,105348,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.224,ANTONIO,How have you made division of yourself?
105348,105349,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.225,ANTONIO,"An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin"
105349,105350,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.226,ANTONIO,Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
105350,105351,Twelfth Night,85.0,5.1.227,OLIVIA,Most wonderful!
105351,105352,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.228,SEBASTIAN,"Do I stand there? I never had a brother,"
105352,105353,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.229,SEBASTIAN,"Nor can there be that deity in my nature,"
105353,105354,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.230,SEBASTIAN,"Of here and every where. I had a sister,"
105354,105355,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.231,SEBASTIAN,Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
105355,105356,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.232,SEBASTIAN,"Of charity, what kin are you to me?"
105356,105357,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.233,SEBASTIAN,What countryman? what name? what parentage?
105357,105358,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.234,VIOLA,"Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father,"
105358,105359,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.235,VIOLA,"Such a Sebastian was my brother too,"
105359,105360,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.236,VIOLA,So went he suited to his watery tomb:
105360,105361,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.237,VIOLA,If spirits can assume both form and suit
105361,105362,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.238,VIOLA,You come to fright us.
105362,105363,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.239,SEBASTIAN,"A spirit I am indeed,"
105363,105364,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.240,SEBASTIAN,But am in that dimension grossly clad
105364,105365,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.241,SEBASTIAN,Which from the womb I did participate.
105365,105366,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.242,SEBASTIAN,"Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,"
105366,105367,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.243,SEBASTIAN,"I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,"
105367,105368,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.244,SEBASTIAN,"And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'"
105368,105369,Twelfth Night,89.0,5.1.245,VIOLA,My father had a mole upon his brow.
105369,105370,Twelfth Night,90.0,5.1.246,SEBASTIAN,And so had mine.
105370,105371,Twelfth Night,91.0,5.1.247,VIOLA,And died that day when Viola from her birth
105371,105372,Twelfth Night,91.0,5.1.248,VIOLA,Had number'd thirteen years.
105372,105373,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.249,SEBASTIAN,"O, that record is lively in my soul!"
105373,105374,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.250,SEBASTIAN,He finished indeed his mortal act
105374,105375,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.251,SEBASTIAN,That day that made my sister thirteen years.
105375,105376,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.252,VIOLA,If nothing lets to make us happy both
105376,105377,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.253,VIOLA,"But this my masculine usurp'd attire,"
105377,105378,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.254,VIOLA,Do not embrace me till each circumstance
105378,105379,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.255,VIOLA,"Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump"
105379,105380,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.256,VIOLA,"That I am Viola: which to confirm,"
105380,105381,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.257,VIOLA,"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,"
105381,105382,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.258,VIOLA,"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help"
105382,105383,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.259,VIOLA,I was preserved to serve this noble count.
105383,105384,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.260,VIOLA,All the occurrence of my fortune since
105384,105385,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.261,VIOLA,Hath been between this lady and this lord.
105385,105386,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.262,SEBASTIAN,"[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:"
105386,105387,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.263,SEBASTIAN,But nature to her bias drew in that.
105387,105388,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.264,SEBASTIAN,"You would have been contracted to a maid,"
105388,105389,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.265,SEBASTIAN,"Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,"
105389,105390,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.266,SEBASTIAN,You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
105390,105391,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.267,DUKE ORSINO,"Be not amazed, right noble is his blood."
105391,105392,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.268,DUKE ORSINO,"If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,"
105392,105393,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.269,DUKE ORSINO,I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
105393,105394,Twelfth Night,95.0,,DUKE ORSINO,To VIOLA
105394,105395,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.270,DUKE ORSINO,"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times"
105395,105396,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.271,DUKE ORSINO,Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
105396,105397,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.272,VIOLA,"And all those sayings will I overswear,"
105397,105398,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.273,VIOLA,And those swearings keep as true in soul
105398,105399,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.274,VIOLA,As doth that orbed continent the fire
105399,105400,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.275,VIOLA,That severs day from night.
105400,105401,Twelfth Night,97.0,5.1.276,DUKE ORSINO,"Give me thy hand,"
105401,105402,Twelfth Night,97.0,5.1.277,DUKE ORSINO,And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
105402,105403,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.278,VIOLA,The captain that did bring me first on shore
105403,105404,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.279,VIOLA,Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
105404,105405,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.280,VIOLA,"Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,"
105405,105406,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.281,VIOLA,"A gentleman, and follower of my lady's."
105406,105407,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.282,OLIVIA,He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
105407,105408,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.283,OLIVIA,"And yet, alas, now I remember me,"
105408,105409,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.284,OLIVIA,"They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract."
105409,105410,Twelfth Night,99.0,,OLIVIA,"Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN"
105410,105411,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.285,OLIVIA,A most extracting frenzy of mine own

105417,105418,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.292,Clown,so it skills not much when they are delivered.
105418,105419,Twelfth Night,101.0,5.1.293,OLIVIA,"Open't, and read it."

105464,105465,Twelfth Night,117.0,5.1.334,MALVOLIO,"Madam, you have done me wrong,"
105465,105466,Twelfth Night,117.0,5.1.335,MALVOLIO,Notorious wrong.
105466,105467,Twelfth Night,118.0,5.1.336,OLIVIA,"Have I, Malvolio? no."
105467,105468,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.337,MALVOLIO,"Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter."
105468,105469,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.338,MALVOLIO,You must not now deny it is your hand:
105469,105470,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.339,MALVOLIO,"Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase,"
105470,105471,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.340,MALVOLIO,"Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:"
105471,105472,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.341,MALVOLIO,"You can say none of this: well, grant it then"
105472,105473,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.342,MALVOLIO,"And tell me, in the modesty of honour,"
105473,105474,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.343,MALVOLIO,"Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,"
105474,105475,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.344,MALVOLIO,"Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,"
105475,105476,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.345,MALVOLIO,To put on yellow stockings and to frown
105476,105477,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.346,MALVOLIO,"Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people,"
105477,105478,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.347,MALVOLIO,"And, acting this in an obedient hope,"
105478,105479,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.348,MALVOLIO,"Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,"
105479,105480,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.349,MALVOLIO,"Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,"
105480,105481,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.350,MALVOLIO,And made the most notorious geck and gull
105481,105482,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.351,MALVOLIO,That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
105482,105483,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.352,OLIVIA,"Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,"
105483,105484,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.353,OLIVIA,"Though, I confess, much like the character"
105484,105485,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.354,OLIVIA,But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
105485,105486,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.355,OLIVIA,"And now I do bethink me, it was she"
105486,105487,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.356,OLIVIA,"First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling,"
105487,105488,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.357,OLIVIA,And in such forms which here were presupposed
105488,105489,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.358,OLIVIA,"Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:"
105489,105490,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.359,OLIVIA,"This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee,"
105490,105491,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.360,OLIVIA,"But when we know the grounds and authors of it,"
105491,105492,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.361,OLIVIA,Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
105492,105493,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.362,OLIVIA,Of thine own cause.
105493,105494,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.363,FABIAN,"Good madam, hear me speak,"
105494,105495,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.364,FABIAN,And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
105495,105496,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.365,FABIAN,"Taint the condition of this present hour,"
105496,105497,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.366,FABIAN,"Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,"
105497,105498,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.367,FABIAN,"Most freely I confess, myself and Toby"
105498,105499,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.368,FABIAN,"Set this device against Malvolio here,"
105499,105500,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.369,FABIAN,Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
105500,105501,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.370,FABIAN,We had conceived against him: Maria writ
105501,105502,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.371,FABIAN,"The letter at Sir Toby's great importance,"
105502,105503,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.372,FABIAN,In recompense whereof he hath married her.
105503,105504,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.373,FABIAN,"How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,"
105504,105505,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.374,FABIAN,"May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,"
105505,105506,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.375,FABIAN,If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
105506,105507,Twelfth Night,121.0,5.1.376,FABIAN,That have on both sides pass'd.
105507,105508,Twelfth Night,122.0,5.1.377,OLIVIA,"Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!"
105508,105509,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.378,Clown,"Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,"
105509,105510,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.379,Clown,and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
105510,105511,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.380,Clown,"one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but"
105511,105512,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.381,Clown,"that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'"
105512,105513,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.382,Clown,"But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such"
105513,105514,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.383,Clown,"a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'"
105514,105515,Twelfth Night,123.0,5.1.384,Clown,and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
105515,105516,Twelfth Night,124.0,5.1.385,MALVOLIO,I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
105516,105517,Twelfth Night,124.0,,MALVOLIO,Exit
105517,105518,Twelfth Night,125.0,5.1.386,OLIVIA,He hath been most notoriously abused.
105518,105519,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.387,DUKE ORSINO,Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
105519,105520,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.388,DUKE ORSINO,He hath not told us of the captain yet:
105520,105521,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.389,DUKE ORSINO,"When that is known and golden time convents,"
105521,105522,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.390,DUKE ORSINO,A solemn combination shall be made
105522,105523,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.391,DUKE ORSINO,"Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,"
105523,105524,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.392,DUKE ORSINO,"We will not part from hence. Cesario, come,"
105524,105525,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.393,DUKE ORSINO,"For so you shall be, while you are a man,"
105525,105526,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.394,DUKE ORSINO,"But when in other habits you are seen,"
105526,105527,Twelfth Night,126.0,5.1.395,DUKE ORSINO,Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
105527,105528,Twelfth Night,126.0,,DUKE ORSINO,"Exeunt all, except Clown"

105529,105530,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.397,Clown,"When that I was and a little tiny boy,"
105530,105531,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.398,Clown,"With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,"
105531,105532,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.399,Clown,"A foolish thing was but a toy,"
105532,105533,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.400,Clown,For the rain it raineth every day.
105533,105534,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.401,Clown,"But when I came to man's estate,"
105534,105535,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.402,Clown,"With hey, ho,  and c."
105535,105536,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.403,Clown,"'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,"

105537,105538,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.405,Clown,"But when I came, alas! to wive,"
105538,105539,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.406,Clown,"With hey, ho,  and c."
105539,105540,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.407,Clown,"By swaggering could I never thrive,"
105540,105541,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.408,Clown,"For the rain,  and c."
105541,105542,Twelfth Night,127.0,5.1.409,Clown,"But when I came unto my beds,"

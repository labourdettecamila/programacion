43492,43493,King John,11.0,,KING HENRY VIII,"Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX, SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON"
43493,43494,King John,1.0,1.1.1,KING JOHN,"Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?"
43494,43495,King John,2.0,1.1.2,CHATILLON,"Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France"
43495,43496,King John,2.0,1.1.3,CHATILLON,"In my behavior to the majesty,"
43496,43497,King John,2.0,1.1.4,CHATILLON,"The borrow'd majesty, of England here."
43497,43498,King John,3.0,1.1.5,QUEEN ELINOR,A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'
43498,43499,King John,4.0,1.1.6,KING JOHN,"Silence, good mother, hear the embassy."
43499,43500,King John,5.0,1.1.7,CHATILLON,"Philip of France, in right and true behalf"
43500,43501,King John,5.0,1.1.8,CHATILLON,"Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,"
43501,43502,King John,5.0,1.1.9,CHATILLON,"Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim"
43502,43503,King John,5.0,1.1.10,CHATILLON,"To this fair island and the territories,"
43503,43504,King John,5.0,1.1.11,CHATILLON,"To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,"
43504,43505,King John,5.0,1.1.12,CHATILLON,Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
43505,43506,King John,5.0,1.1.13,CHATILLON,"Which sways usurpingly these several titles,"
43506,43507,King John,5.0,1.1.14,CHATILLON,"And put these same into young Arthur's hand,"
43507,43508,King John,5.0,1.1.15,CHATILLON,Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
43508,43509,King John,6.0,1.1.16,KING JOHN,What follows if we disallow of this?
43509,43510,King John,7.0,1.1.17,CHATILLON,"The proud control of fierce and bloody war,"
43510,43511,King John,7.0,1.1.18,CHATILLON,To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
43511,43512,King John,8.0,1.1.19,KING JOHN,"Here have we war for war and blood for blood,"
43512,43513,King John,8.0,1.1.20,KING JOHN,Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
43513,43514,King John,9.0,1.1.21,CHATILLON,"Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,"
43514,43515,King John,9.0,1.1.22,CHATILLON,The farthest limit of my embassy.
43515,43516,King John,10.0,1.1.23,KING JOHN,"Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:"
43516,43517,King John,10.0,1.1.24,KING JOHN,"Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France,"
43517,43518,King John,10.0,1.1.25,KING JOHN,"For ere thou canst report I will be there,"
43518,43519,King John,10.0,1.1.26,KING JOHN,The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
43519,43520,King John,10.0,1.1.27,KING JOHN,So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
43520,43521,King John,10.0,1.1.28,KING JOHN,And sullen presage of your own decay.
43521,43522,King John,10.0,1.1.29,KING JOHN,An honourable conduct let him have:
43522,43523,King John,10.0,1.1.30,KING JOHN,"Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon."
43523,43524,King John,10.0,,KING JOHN,Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE
43524,43525,King John,11.0,1.1.31,QUEEN ELINOR,"What now, my son! have I not ever said"
43525,43526,King John,11.0,1.1.32,QUEEN ELINOR,How that ambitious Constance would not cease
43526,43527,King John,11.0,1.1.33,QUEEN ELINOR,"Till she had kindled France and all the world,"
43527,43528,King John,11.0,1.1.34,QUEEN ELINOR,Upon the right and party of her son?
43528,43529,King John,11.0,1.1.35,QUEEN ELINOR,This might have been prevented and made whole
43529,43530,King John,11.0,1.1.36,QUEEN ELINOR,"With very easy arguments of love,"
43530,43531,King John,11.0,1.1.37,QUEEN ELINOR,Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
43531,43532,King John,11.0,1.1.38,QUEEN ELINOR,With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
43532,43533,King John,12.0,1.1.39,KING JOHN,Our strong possession and our right for us.
43533,43534,King John,13.0,1.1.40,QUEEN ELINOR,"Your strong possession much more than your right,"
43534,43535,King John,13.0,1.1.41,QUEEN ELINOR,Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
43535,43536,King John,13.0,1.1.42,QUEEN ELINOR,"So much my conscience whispers in your ear,"
43536,43537,King John,13.0,1.1.43,QUEEN ELINOR,Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
43537,43538,King John,13.0,,QUEEN ELINOR,Enter a Sheriff
43538,43539,King John,14.0,1.1.44,ESSEX,"My liege, here is the strangest controversy"
43539,43540,King John,14.0,1.1.45,ESSEX,"Come from country to be judged by you,"
43540,43541,King John,14.0,1.1.46,ESSEX,That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?
43541,43542,King John,15.0,1.1.47,KING JOHN,Let them approach.
43542,43543,King John,15.0,1.1.48,KING JOHN,Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
43543,43544,King John,15.0,1.1.49,KING JOHN,This expedition's charge.
43544,43545,King John,15.0,,KING JOHN,Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD
43545,43546,King John,15.0,1.1.50,KING JOHN,What men are you?
43546,43547,King John,16.0,1.1.51,BASTARD,"Your faithful subject I, a gentleman"
43547,43548,King John,16.0,1.1.52,BASTARD,"Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,"
43548,43549,King John,16.0,1.1.53,BASTARD,"As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,"
43549,43550,King John,16.0,1.1.54,BASTARD,"A soldier, by the honour-giving hand"
43550,43551,King John,16.0,1.1.55,BASTARD,Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
43551,43552,King John,17.0,1.1.56,KING JOHN,What art thou?
43552,43553,King John,18.0,1.1.57,ROBERT,The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
43553,43554,King John,19.0,1.1.58,KING JOHN,"Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?"
43554,43555,King John,19.0,1.1.59,KING JOHN,"You came not of one mother then, it seems."
43555,43556,King John,20.0,1.1.60,BASTARD,"Most certain of one mother, mighty king,"
43556,43557,King John,20.0,1.1.61,BASTARD,"That is well known, and, as I think, one father:"
43557,43558,King John,20.0,1.1.62,BASTARD,But for the certain knowledge of that truth
43558,43559,King John,20.0,1.1.63,BASTARD,I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
43559,43560,King John,20.0,1.1.64,BASTARD,"Of that I doubt, as all men's children may."
43560,43561,King John,21.0,1.1.65,QUEEN ELINOR,"Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother"
43561,43562,King John,21.0,1.1.66,QUEEN ELINOR,And wound her honour with this diffidence.
43562,43563,King John,22.0,1.1.67,BASTARD,"I, madam? no, I have no reason for it,"
43563,43564,King John,22.0,1.1.68,BASTARD,"That is my brother's plea and none of mine,"
43564,43565,King John,22.0,1.1.69,BASTARD,"The which if he can prove, a' pops me out"
43565,43566,King John,22.0,1.1.70,BASTARD,At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
43566,43567,King John,22.0,1.1.71,BASTARD,Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
43567,43568,King John,23.0,1.1.72,KING JOHN,"A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,"
43568,43569,King John,23.0,1.1.73,KING JOHN,Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
43569,43570,King John,24.0,1.1.74,BASTARD,"I know not why, except to get the land."
43570,43571,King John,24.0,1.1.75,BASTARD,But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
43571,43572,King John,24.0,1.1.76,BASTARD,"But whether I be as true begot or no,"
43572,43573,King John,24.0,1.1.77,BASTARD,"That still I lay upon my mother's head,"
43573,43574,King John,24.0,1.1.78,BASTARD,"But that I am as well begot, my liege,--"
43574,43575,King John,24.0,1.1.79,BASTARD,Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
43575,43576,King John,24.0,1.1.80,BASTARD,Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
43576,43577,King John,24.0,1.1.81,BASTARD,If old sir Robert did beget us both
43577,43578,King John,24.0,1.1.82,BASTARD,"And were our father and this son like him,"
43578,43579,King John,24.0,1.1.83,BASTARD,"O old sir Robert, father, on my knee"
43579,43580,King John,24.0,1.1.84,BASTARD,I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
43580,43581,King John,25.0,1.1.85,KING JOHN,"Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!"
43581,43582,King John,26.0,1.1.86,QUEEN ELINOR,"He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face,"
43582,43583,King John,26.0,1.1.87,QUEEN ELINOR,The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
43583,43584,King John,26.0,1.1.88,QUEEN ELINOR,Do you not read some tokens of my son
43584,43585,King John,26.0,1.1.89,QUEEN ELINOR,In the large composition of this man?
43585,43586,King John,27.0,1.1.90,KING JOHN,Mine eye hath well examined his parts
43586,43587,King John,27.0,1.1.91,KING JOHN,"And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,"
43587,43588,King John,27.0,1.1.92,KING JOHN,What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
43588,43589,King John,28.0,1.1.93,BASTARD,"Because he hath a half-face, like my father."
43589,43590,King John,28.0,1.1.94,BASTARD,With half that face would he have all my land:
43590,43591,King John,28.0,1.1.95,BASTARD,A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
43591,43592,King John,29.0,1.1.96,ROBERT,"My gracious liege, when that my father lived,"
43592,43593,King John,29.0,1.1.97,ROBERT,"Your brother did employ my father much,--"
43593,43594,King John,30.0,1.1.98,BASTARD,"Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:"
43594,43595,King John,30.0,1.1.99,BASTARD,Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
43595,43596,King John,31.0,1.1.100,ROBERT,And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
43596,43597,King John,31.0,1.1.101,ROBERT,"To Germany, there with the emperor"
43597,43598,King John,31.0,1.1.102,ROBERT,To treat of high affairs touching that time.
43598,43599,King John,31.0,1.1.103,ROBERT,The advantage of his absence took the king
43599,43600,King John,31.0,1.1.104,ROBERT,"And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's,"
43600,43601,King John,31.0,1.1.105,ROBERT,"Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,"
43601,43602,King John,31.0,1.1.106,ROBERT,But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
43602,43603,King John,31.0,1.1.107,ROBERT,"Between my father and my mother lay,"
43603,43604,King John,31.0,1.1.108,ROBERT,"As I have heard my father speak himself,"
43604,43605,King John,31.0,1.1.109,ROBERT,When this same lusty gentleman was got.
43605,43606,King John,31.0,1.1.110,ROBERT,Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
43606,43607,King John,31.0,1.1.111,ROBERT,"His lands to me, and took it on his death"
43607,43608,King John,31.0,1.1.112,ROBERT,"That this my mother's son was none of his,"
43608,43609,King John,31.0,1.1.113,ROBERT,"And if he were, he came into the world"
43609,43610,King John,31.0,1.1.114,ROBERT,Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
43610,43611,King John,31.0,1.1.115,ROBERT,"Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,"
43611,43612,King John,31.0,1.1.116,ROBERT,"My father's land, as was my father's will."
43612,43613,King John,32.0,1.1.117,KING JOHN,"Sirrah, your brother is legitimate,"
43613,43614,King John,32.0,1.1.118,KING JOHN,"Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,"
43614,43615,King John,32.0,1.1.119,KING JOHN,"And if she did play false, the fault was hers,"
43615,43616,King John,32.0,1.1.120,KING JOHN,Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
43616,43617,King John,32.0,1.1.121,KING JOHN,"That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,"
43617,43618,King John,32.0,1.1.122,KING JOHN,"Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,"
43618,43619,King John,32.0,1.1.123,KING JOHN,Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
43619,43620,King John,32.0,1.1.124,KING JOHN,"In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept"
43620,43621,King John,32.0,1.1.125,KING JOHN,"This calf bred from his cow from all the world,"
43621,43622,King John,32.0,1.1.126,KING JOHN,"In sooth he might, then, if he were my brother's,"
43622,43623,King John,32.0,1.1.127,KING JOHN,"My brother might not claim him, nor your father,"
43623,43624,King John,32.0,1.1.128,KING JOHN,"Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes,"
43624,43625,King John,32.0,1.1.129,KING JOHN,"My mother's son did get your father's heir,"
43625,43626,King John,32.0,1.1.130,KING JOHN,Your father's heir must have your father's land.
43626,43627,King John,33.0,1.1.131,ROBERT,Shall then my father's will be of no force
43627,43628,King John,33.0,1.1.132,ROBERT,To dispossess that child which is not his?
43628,43629,King John,34.0,1.1.133,BASTARD,"Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,"
43629,43630,King John,34.0,1.1.134,BASTARD,"Than was his will to get me, as I think."
43630,43631,King John,35.0,1.1.135,QUEEN ELINOR,Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
43631,43632,King John,35.0,1.1.136,QUEEN ELINOR,"And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,"
43632,43633,King John,35.0,1.1.137,QUEEN ELINOR,"Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,"
43633,43634,King John,35.0,1.1.138,QUEEN ELINOR,Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
43634,43635,King John,36.0,1.1.139,BASTARD,"Madam, an if my brother had my shape,"
43635,43636,King John,36.0,1.1.140,BASTARD,"And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him,"
43636,43637,King John,36.0,1.1.141,BASTARD,"And if my legs were two such riding-rods,"
43637,43638,King John,36.0,1.1.142,BASTARD,"My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin"
43638,43639,King John,36.0,1.1.143,BASTARD,That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
43639,43640,King John,36.0,1.1.144,BASTARD,"Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'"
43640,43641,King John,36.0,1.1.145,BASTARD,"And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,"
43641,43642,King John,36.0,1.1.146,BASTARD,"Would I might never stir from off this place,"
43642,43643,King John,36.0,1.1.147,BASTARD,"I would give it every foot to have this face,"
43643,43644,King John,36.0,1.1.148,BASTARD,I would not be sir Nob in any case.
43644,43645,King John,37.0,1.1.149,QUEEN ELINOR,"I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,"
43645,43646,King John,37.0,1.1.150,QUEEN ELINOR,Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
43646,43647,King John,37.0,1.1.151,QUEEN ELINOR,I am a soldier and now bound to France.
43647,43648,King John,38.0,1.1.152,BASTARD,"Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance."
43648,43649,King John,38.0,1.1.153,BASTARD,"Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,"
43649,43650,King John,38.0,1.1.154,BASTARD,Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
43650,43651,King John,38.0,1.1.155,BASTARD,"Madam, I'll follow you unto the death."
43651,43652,King John,39.0,1.1.156,QUEEN ELINOR,"Nay, I would have you go before me thither."
43652,43653,King John,40.0,1.1.157,BASTARD,Our country manners give our betters way.
43653,43654,King John,41.0,1.1.158,KING JOHN,What is thy name?
43654,43655,King John,42.0,1.1.159,BASTARD,"Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,"
43655,43656,King John,42.0,1.1.160,BASTARD,"Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son."
43656,43657,King John,43.0,1.1.161,KING JOHN,From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:
43657,43658,King John,43.0,1.1.162,KING JOHN,"Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,"
43658,43659,King John,43.0,1.1.163,KING JOHN,Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.
43659,43660,King John,44.0,1.1.164,BASTARD,"Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:"
43660,43661,King John,44.0,1.1.165,BASTARD,"My father gave me honour, yours gave land."
43661,43662,King John,44.0,1.1.166,BASTARD,"Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,"
43662,43663,King John,44.0,1.1.167,BASTARD,"When I was got, sir Robert was away!"
43663,43664,King John,45.0,1.1.168,QUEEN ELINOR,The very spirit of Plantagenet!
43664,43665,King John,45.0,1.1.169,QUEEN ELINOR,"I am thy grandam, Richard, call me so."
43665,43666,King John,46.0,1.1.170,BASTARD,"Madam, by chance but not by truth, what though?"
43666,43667,King John,46.0,1.1.171,BASTARD,"Something about, a little from the right,"
43667,43668,King John,46.0,1.1.172,BASTARD,"In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:"
43668,43669,King John,46.0,1.1.173,BASTARD,"Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,"
43669,43670,King John,46.0,1.1.174,BASTARD,"And have is have, however men do catch:"
43670,43671,King John,46.0,1.1.175,BASTARD,"Near or far off, well won is still well shot,"
43671,43672,King John,46.0,1.1.176,BASTARD,"And I am I, howe'er I was begot."
43672,43673,King John,47.0,1.1.177,KING JOHN,"Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire,"
43673,43674,King John,47.0,1.1.178,KING JOHN,A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
43674,43675,King John,47.0,1.1.179,KING JOHN,"Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed"
43675,43676,King John,47.0,1.1.180,KING JOHN,"For France, for France, for it is more than need."
43676,43677,King John,48.0,1.1.181,BASTARD,"Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!"
43677,43678,King John,48.0,1.1.182,BASTARD,For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
43678,43679,King John,48.0,,BASTARD,Exeunt all but BASTARD
43679,43680,King John,48.0,1.1.183,BASTARD,"A foot of honour better than I was,"
43680,43681,King John,48.0,1.1.184,BASTARD,But many a many foot of land the worse.
43681,43682,King John,48.0,1.1.185,BASTARD,"Well, now can I make any Joan a lady."
43682,43683,King John,48.0,1.1.186,BASTARD,"'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--"
43683,43684,King John,48.0,1.1.187,BASTARD,"And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter,"
43684,43685,King John,48.0,1.1.188,BASTARD,"For new-made honour doth forget men's names,"
43685,43686,King John,48.0,1.1.189,BASTARD,'Tis too respective and too sociable
43686,43687,King John,48.0,1.1.190,BASTARD,"For your conversion. Now your traveller,"
43687,43688,King John,48.0,1.1.191,BASTARD,"He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,"
43688,43689,King John,48.0,1.1.192,BASTARD,"And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,"
43689,43690,King John,48.0,1.1.193,BASTARD,Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
43690,43691,King John,48.0,1.1.194,BASTARD,"My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'"
43691,43692,King John,48.0,1.1.195,BASTARD,"Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,"
43692,43693,King John,48.0,1.1.196,BASTARD,"'I shall beseech you'--that is question now,"
43693,43694,King John,48.0,1.1.197,BASTARD,And then comes answer like an Absey book:
43694,43695,King John,48.0,1.1.198,BASTARD,"'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command,"
43695,43696,King John,48.0,1.1.199,BASTARD,"At your employment, at your service, sir,'"
43696,43697,King John,48.0,1.1.200,BASTARD,"'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'"
43697,43698,King John,48.0,1.1.201,BASTARD,"And so, ere answer knows what question would,"
43698,43699,King John,48.0,1.1.202,BASTARD,"Saving in dialogue of compliment,"
43699,43700,King John,48.0,1.1.203,BASTARD,"And talking of the Alps and Apennines,"
43700,43701,King John,48.0,1.1.204,BASTARD,"The Pyrenean and the river Po,"
43701,43702,King John,48.0,1.1.205,BASTARD,It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
43702,43703,King John,48.0,1.1.206,BASTARD,But this is worshipful society
43703,43704,King John,48.0,1.1.207,BASTARD,"And fits the mounting spirit like myself,"
43704,43705,King John,48.0,1.1.208,BASTARD,For he is but a bastard to the time
43705,43706,King John,48.0,1.1.209,BASTARD,"That doth not smack of observation,"
43706,43707,King John,48.0,1.1.210,BASTARD,"And so am I, whether I smack or no,"
43707,43708,King John,48.0,1.1.211,BASTARD,"And not alone in habit and device,"
43708,43709,King John,48.0,1.1.212,BASTARD,"Exterior form, outward accoutrement,"
43709,43710,King John,48.0,1.1.213,BASTARD,But from the inward motion to deliver
43710,43711,King John,48.0,1.1.214,BASTARD,"Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:"
43711,43712,King John,48.0,1.1.215,BASTARD,"Which, though I will not practise to deceive,"
43712,43713,King John,48.0,1.1.216,BASTARD,"Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn,"
43713,43714,King John,48.0,1.1.217,BASTARD,For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
43714,43715,King John,48.0,1.1.218,BASTARD,But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
43715,43716,King John,48.0,1.1.219,BASTARD,What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
43716,43717,King John,48.0,1.1.220,BASTARD,That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
43717,43718,King John,48.0,,BASTARD,Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY
43718,43719,King John,48.0,1.1.221,BASTARD,"O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!"
43719,43720,King John,48.0,1.1.222,BASTARD,What brings you here to court so hastily?
43720,43721,King John,49.0,1.1.223,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,"
43721,43722,King John,49.0,1.1.224,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
43722,43723,King John,50.0,1.1.225,BASTARD,My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
43723,43724,King John,50.0,1.1.226,BASTARD,"Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?"
43724,43725,King John,50.0,1.1.227,BASTARD,Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
43725,43726,King John,51.0,1.1.228,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,"
43726,43727,King John,51.0,1.1.229,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?
43727,43728,King John,51.0,1.1.230,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou."
43728,43729,King John,52.0,1.1.231,BASTARD,"James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?"
43729,43730,King John,53.0,1.1.232,GURNEY,"Good leave, good Philip."
43730,43731,King John,54.0,1.1.233,BASTARD,"Philip! sparrow: James,"
43731,43732,King John,54.0,1.1.234,BASTARD,There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
43732,43733,King John,54.0,,BASTARD,Exit GURNEY
43733,43734,King John,54.0,1.1.235,BASTARD,"Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:"
43734,43735,King John,54.0,1.1.236,BASTARD,Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
43735,43736,King John,54.0,1.1.237,BASTARD,Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
43736,43737,King John,54.0,1.1.238,BASTARD,"Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,"
43737,43738,King John,54.0,1.1.239,BASTARD,Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
43738,43739,King John,54.0,1.1.240,BASTARD,"We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,"
43739,43740,King John,54.0,1.1.241,BASTARD,To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
43740,43741,King John,54.0,1.1.242,BASTARD,Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
43741,43742,King John,55.0,1.1.243,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,"
43742,43743,King John,55.0,1.1.244,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
43743,43744,King John,55.0,1.1.245,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?"
43744,43745,King John,56.0,1.1.246,BASTARD,"Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like."
43745,43746,King John,56.0,1.1.247,BASTARD,What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
43746,43747,King John,56.0,1.1.248,BASTARD,"But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son,"
43747,43748,King John,56.0,1.1.249,BASTARD,"I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land,"
43748,43749,King John,56.0,1.1.250,BASTARD,"Legitimation, name and all is gone:"
43749,43750,King John,56.0,1.1.251,BASTARD,"Then, good my mother, let me know my father,"
43750,43751,King John,56.0,1.1.252,BASTARD,"Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?"
43751,43752,King John,57.0,1.1.253,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
43752,43753,King John,58.0,1.1.254,BASTARD,As faithfully as I deny the devil.
43753,43754,King John,59.0,1.1.255,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:
43754,43755,King John,59.0,1.1.256,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,By long and vehement suit I was seduced
43755,43756,King John,59.0,1.1.257,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,To make room for him in my husband's bed:
43756,43757,King John,59.0,1.1.258,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
43757,43758,King John,59.0,1.1.259,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,"Thou art the issue of my dear offence,"
43758,43759,King John,59.0,1.1.260,LADY FAULCONBRIDGE,Which was so strongly urged past my defence.
43759,43760,King John,60.0,1.1.261,BASTARD,"Now, by this light, were I to get again,"
43760,43761,King John,60.0,1.1.262,BASTARD,"Madam, I would not wish a better father."
43761,43762,King John,60.0,1.1.263,BASTARD,"Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,"
43762,43763,King John,60.0,1.1.264,BASTARD,"And so doth yours, your fault was not your folly:"
43763,43764,King John,60.0,1.1.265,BASTARD,"Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,"
43764,43765,King John,60.0,1.1.266,BASTARD,"Subjected tribute to commanding love,"
43765,43766,King John,60.0,1.1.267,BASTARD,Against whose fury and unmatched force
43766,43767,King John,60.0,1.1.268,BASTARD,"The aweless lion could not wage the fight,"
43767,43768,King John,60.0,1.1.269,BASTARD,Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
43768,43769,King John,60.0,1.1.270,BASTARD,He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
43769,43770,King John,60.0,1.1.271,BASTARD,"May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,"
43770,43771,King John,60.0,1.1.272,BASTARD,With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
43771,43772,King John,60.0,1.1.273,BASTARD,Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
43772,43773,King John,60.0,1.1.274,BASTARD,"When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell."
43773,43774,King John,60.0,1.1.275,BASTARD,"Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin,"
43774,43775,King John,60.0,1.1.276,BASTARD,"And they shall say, when Richard me begot,"
43775,43776,King John,60.0,1.1.277,BASTARD,"If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:"
43776,43777,King John,60.0,1.1.278,BASTARD,"Who says it was, he lies, I say 'twas not."
43777,43778,King John,60.0,,BASTARD,Exeunt
43778,43779,King John,60.0,,BASTARD,ACT II
43779,43780,King John,60.0,,BASTARD,SCENE I. France. Before Angiers.
43780,43781,King John,60.0,,BASTARD,"Enter AUSTRIA and forces, drums, etc. on one side:  on the other KING PHILIP and his power, LEWIS, ARTHUR, CONSTANCE and attendants"
43781,43782,King John,1.0,2.1.1,LEWIS,"Before Angiers well met, brave Austria."
43782,43783,King John,1.0,2.1.2,LEWIS,"Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,"
43783,43784,King John,1.0,2.1.3,LEWIS,"Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart"
43784,43785,King John,1.0,2.1.4,LEWIS,"And fought the holy wars in Palestine,"
43785,43786,King John,1.0,2.1.5,LEWIS,By this brave duke came early to his grave:
43786,43787,King John,1.0,2.1.6,LEWIS,"And for amends to his posterity,"
43787,43788,King John,1.0,2.1.7,LEWIS,"At our importance hither is he come,"
43788,43789,King John,1.0,2.1.8,LEWIS,"To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,"
43789,43790,King John,1.0,2.1.9,LEWIS,And to rebuke the usurpation
43790,43791,King John,1.0,2.1.10,LEWIS,"Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:"
43791,43792,King John,1.0,2.1.11,LEWIS,"Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither."
43792,43793,King John,2.0,2.1.12,ARTHUR,God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
43793,43794,King John,2.0,2.1.13,ARTHUR,"The rather that you give his offspring life,"
43794,43795,King John,2.0,2.1.14,ARTHUR,Shadowing their right under your wings of war:
43795,43796,King John,2.0,2.1.15,ARTHUR,"I give you welcome with a powerless hand,"
43796,43797,King John,2.0,2.1.16,ARTHUR,But with a heart full of unstained love:
43797,43798,King John,2.0,2.1.17,ARTHUR,"Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke."
43798,43799,King John,3.0,2.1.18,LEWIS,A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
43799,43800,King John,4.0,2.1.19,AUSTRIA,"Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,"
43800,43801,King John,4.0,2.1.20,AUSTRIA,"As seal to this indenture of my love,"
43801,43802,King John,4.0,2.1.21,AUSTRIA,"That to my home I will no more return,"
43802,43803,King John,4.0,2.1.22,AUSTRIA,"Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,"
43803,43804,King John,4.0,2.1.23,AUSTRIA,"Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,"
43804,43805,King John,4.0,2.1.24,AUSTRIA,Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
43805,43806,King John,4.0,2.1.25,AUSTRIA,"And coops from other lands her islanders,"
43806,43807,King John,4.0,2.1.26,AUSTRIA,"Even till that England, hedged in with the main,"
43807,43808,King John,4.0,2.1.27,AUSTRIA,"That water-walled bulwark, still secure"
43808,43809,King John,4.0,2.1.28,AUSTRIA,"And confident from foreign purposes,"
43809,43810,King John,4.0,2.1.29,AUSTRIA,Even till that utmost corner of the west
43810,43811,King John,4.0,2.1.30,AUSTRIA,"Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,"
43811,43812,King John,4.0,2.1.31,AUSTRIA,"Will I not think of home, but follow arms."
43812,43813,King John,5.0,2.1.32,CONSTANCE,"O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,"
43813,43814,King John,5.0,2.1.33,CONSTANCE,Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
43814,43815,King John,5.0,2.1.34,CONSTANCE,To make a more requital to your love!
43815,43816,King John,6.0,2.1.35,AUSTRIA,The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
43816,43817,King John,6.0,2.1.36,AUSTRIA,In such a just and charitable war.
43817,43818,King John,7.0,2.1.37,KING PHILIP,"Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent"
43818,43819,King John,7.0,2.1.38,KING PHILIP,Against the brows of this resisting town.
43819,43820,King John,7.0,2.1.39,KING PHILIP,"Call for our chiefest men of discipline,"
43820,43821,King John,7.0,2.1.40,KING PHILIP,To cull the plots of best advantages:
43821,43822,King John,7.0,2.1.41,KING PHILIP,"We'll lay before this town our royal bones,"
43822,43823,King John,7.0,2.1.42,KING PHILIP,"Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,"
43823,43824,King John,7.0,2.1.43,KING PHILIP,But we will make it subject to this boy.
43824,43825,King John,8.0,2.1.44,CONSTANCE,"Stay for an answer to your embassy,"
43825,43826,King John,8.0,2.1.45,CONSTANCE,Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:
43826,43827,King John,8.0,2.1.46,CONSTANCE,"My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,"
43827,43828,King John,8.0,2.1.47,CONSTANCE,"That right in peace which here we urge in war,"
43828,43829,King John,8.0,2.1.48,CONSTANCE,And then we shall repent each drop of blood
43829,43830,King John,8.0,2.1.49,CONSTANCE,That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
43830,43831,King John,8.0,,CONSTANCE,Enter CHATILLON
43831,43832,King John,9.0,2.1.50,KING PHILIP,"A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,"
43832,43833,King John,9.0,2.1.51,KING PHILIP,Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!
43833,43834,King John,9.0,2.1.52,KING PHILIP,"What England says, say briefly, gentle lord,"
43834,43835,King John,9.0,2.1.53,KING PHILIP,"We coldly pause for thee, Chatillon, speak."
43835,43836,King John,10.0,2.1.54,CHATILLON,Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
43836,43837,King John,10.0,2.1.55,CHATILLON,And stir them up against a mightier task.
43837,43838,King John,10.0,2.1.56,CHATILLON,"England, impatient of your just demands,"
43838,43839,King John,10.0,2.1.57,CHATILLON,"Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,"
43839,43840,King John,10.0,2.1.58,CHATILLON,"Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time"
43840,43841,King John,10.0,2.1.59,CHATILLON,"To land his legions all as soon as I,"
43841,43842,King John,10.0,2.1.60,CHATILLON,"His marches are expedient to this town,"
43842,43843,King John,10.0,2.1.61,CHATILLON,"His forces strong, his soldiers confident."
43843,43844,King John,10.0,2.1.62,CHATILLON,"With him along is come the mother-queen,"
43844,43845,King John,10.0,2.1.63,CHATILLON,"An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife,"
43845,43846,King John,10.0,2.1.64,CHATILLON,"With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain,"
43846,43847,King John,10.0,2.1.65,CHATILLON,"With them a bastard of the king's deceased,"
43847,43848,King John,10.0,2.1.66,CHATILLON,"And all the unsettled humours of the land,"
43848,43849,King John,10.0,2.1.67,CHATILLON,"Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,"
43849,43850,King John,10.0,2.1.68,CHATILLON,"With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,"
43850,43851,King John,10.0,2.1.69,CHATILLON,"Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,"
43851,43852,King John,10.0,2.1.70,CHATILLON,"Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,"
43852,43853,King John,10.0,2.1.71,CHATILLON,To make hazard of new fortunes here:
43853,43854,King John,10.0,2.1.72,CHATILLON,"In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits"
43854,43855,King John,10.0,2.1.73,CHATILLON,Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
43855,43856,King John,10.0,2.1.74,CHATILLON,"Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,"

44153,44154,King John,76.0,2.1.364,BASTARD,Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?

44170,44171,King John,83.0,2.1.381,BASTARD,"By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,"
44171,44172,King John,83.0,2.1.382,BASTARD,"And stand securely on their battlements,"
44172,44173,King John,83.0,2.1.383,BASTARD,"As in a theatre, whence they gape and point"

44176,44177,King John,83.0,2.1.387,BASTARD,Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
44177,44178,King John,83.0,2.1.388,BASTARD,Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
44178,44179,King John,83.0,2.1.389,BASTARD,By east and west let France and England mount
44179,44180,King John,83.0,2.1.390,BASTARD,"Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,"
44180,44181,King John,83.0,2.1.391,BASTARD,Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
44181,44182,King John,83.0,2.1.392,BASTARD,The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
44182,44183,King John,83.0,2.1.393,BASTARD,"I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,"

44193,44194,King John,83.0,2.1.404,BASTARD,Smacks it not something of the policy?

44201,44202,King John,85.0,2.1.412,BASTARD,"As we will ours, against these saucy walls,"
44202,44203,King John,85.0,2.1.413,BASTARD,"And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,"
44203,44204,King John,85.0,2.1.414,BASTARD,Why then defy each other and pell-mell
44204,44205,King John,85.0,2.1.415,BASTARD,"Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell."
44205,44206,King John,86.0,2.1.416,KING PHILIP,"Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?"

44212,44213,King John,90.0,2.1.423,BASTARD,Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
44213,44214,King John,90.0,2.1.424,BASTARD,"I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!"

44220,44221,King John,92.0,2.1.431,KING JOHN,"Speak on with favour, we are bent to hear."
44221,44222,King John,93.0,2.1.432,First Citizen,"That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,"
44222,44223,King John,93.0,2.1.433,First Citizen,Is niece to England: look upon the years
44223,44224,King John,93.0,2.1.434,First Citizen,Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
44224,44225,King John,93.0,2.1.435,First Citizen,"If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,"
44225,44226,King John,93.0,2.1.436,First Citizen,Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
44226,44227,King John,93.0,2.1.437,First Citizen,"If zealous love should go in search of virtue,"
44227,44228,King John,93.0,2.1.438,First Citizen,Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
44228,44229,King John,93.0,2.1.439,First Citizen,"If love ambitious sought a match of birth,"
44229,44230,King John,93.0,2.1.440,First Citizen,Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
44230,44231,King John,93.0,2.1.441,First Citizen,"Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,"
44231,44232,King John,93.0,2.1.442,First Citizen,Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
44232,44233,King John,93.0,2.1.443,First Citizen,"If not complete of, say he is not she,"
44233,44234,King John,93.0,2.1.444,First Citizen,"And she again wants nothing, to name want,"
44234,44235,King John,93.0,2.1.445,First Citizen,If want it be not that she is not he:
44235,44236,King John,93.0,2.1.446,First Citizen,"He is the half part of a blessed man,"
44236,44237,King John,93.0,2.1.447,First Citizen,"Left to be finished by such as she,"
44237,44238,King John,93.0,2.1.448,First Citizen,"And she a fair divided excellence,"
44238,44239,King John,93.0,2.1.449,First Citizen,Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
44239,44240,King John,93.0,2.1.450,First Citizen,"O, two such silver currents, when they join,"
44240,44241,King John,93.0,2.1.451,First Citizen,"Do glorify the banks that bound them in,"
44241,44242,King John,93.0,2.1.452,First Citizen,"And two such shores to two such streams made one,"
44242,44243,King John,93.0,2.1.453,First Citizen,"Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,"
44243,44244,King John,93.0,2.1.454,First Citizen,"To these two princes, if you marry them."
44244,44245,King John,93.0,2.1.455,First Citizen,This union shall do more than battery can
44245,44246,King John,93.0,2.1.456,First Citizen,"To our fast-closed gates, for at this match,"
44246,44247,King John,93.0,2.1.457,First Citizen,"With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,"
44247,44248,King John,93.0,2.1.458,First Citizen,"The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,"
44248,44249,King John,93.0,2.1.459,First Citizen,"And give you entrance: but without this match,"
44249,44250,King John,93.0,2.1.460,First Citizen,"The sea enraged is not half so deaf,"
44250,44251,King John,93.0,2.1.461,First Citizen,"Lions more confident, mountains and rocks"
44251,44252,King John,93.0,2.1.462,First Citizen,"More free from motion, no, not Death himself"
44252,44253,King John,93.0,2.1.463,First Citizen,"In moral fury half so peremptory,"
44253,44254,King John,93.0,2.1.464,First Citizen,As we to keep this city.
44254,44255,King John,94.0,2.1.465,BASTARD,Here's a stay
44255,44256,King John,94.0,2.1.466,BASTARD,That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
44256,44257,King John,94.0,2.1.467,BASTARD,"Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,"
44257,44258,King John,94.0,2.1.468,BASTARD,"That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,"
44258,44259,King John,94.0,2.1.469,BASTARD,Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
44259,44260,King John,94.0,2.1.470,BASTARD,As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
44260,44261,King John,94.0,2.1.471,BASTARD,What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
44261,44262,King John,94.0,2.1.472,BASTARD,"He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce,"
44262,44263,King John,94.0,2.1.473,BASTARD,He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
44263,44264,King John,94.0,2.1.474,BASTARD,"Our ears are cudgell'd, not a word of his"
44264,44265,King John,94.0,2.1.475,BASTARD,But buffets better than a fist of France:
44265,44266,King John,94.0,2.1.476,BASTARD,Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
44266,44267,King John,94.0,2.1.477,BASTARD,Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
44267,44268,King John,95.0,2.1.478,QUEEN ELINOR,"Son, list to this conjunction, make this match,"
44268,44269,King John,95.0,2.1.479,QUEEN ELINOR,Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
44269,44270,King John,95.0,2.1.480,QUEEN ELINOR,For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
44270,44271,King John,95.0,2.1.481,QUEEN ELINOR,"Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,"
44271,44272,King John,95.0,2.1.482,QUEEN ELINOR,That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
44272,44273,King John,95.0,2.1.483,QUEEN ELINOR,The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
44273,44274,King John,95.0,2.1.484,QUEEN ELINOR,"I see a yielding in the looks of France,"
44274,44275,King John,95.0,2.1.485,QUEEN ELINOR,"Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls"
44275,44276,King John,95.0,2.1.486,QUEEN ELINOR,"Are capable of this ambition,"
44276,44277,King John,95.0,2.1.487,QUEEN ELINOR,"Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath"
44277,44278,King John,95.0,2.1.488,QUEEN ELINOR,"Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,"
44278,44279,King John,95.0,2.1.489,QUEEN ELINOR,Cool and congeal again to what it was.
44279,44280,King John,96.0,2.1.490,First Citizen,Why answer not the double majesties
44280,44281,King John,96.0,2.1.491,First Citizen,This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
44281,44282,King John,97.0,2.1.492,KING PHILIP,"Speak England first, that hath been forward first"
44282,44283,King John,97.0,2.1.493,KING PHILIP,To speak unto this city: what say you?
44283,44284,King John,98.0,2.1.494,KING JOHN,"If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,"
44284,44285,King John,98.0,2.1.495,KING JOHN,"Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'"
44285,44286,King John,98.0,2.1.496,KING JOHN,Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
44286,44287,King John,98.0,2.1.497,KING JOHN,"For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,"
44287,44288,King John,98.0,2.1.498,KING JOHN,"And all that we upon this side the sea,"
44288,44289,King John,98.0,2.1.499,KING JOHN,"Except this city now by us besieged,"
44289,44290,King John,98.0,2.1.500,KING JOHN,"Find liable to our crown and dignity,"
44290,44291,King John,98.0,2.1.501,KING JOHN,Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
44291,44292,King John,98.0,2.1.502,KING JOHN,"In titles, honours and promotions,"
44292,44293,King John,98.0,2.1.503,KING JOHN,"As she in beauty, education, blood,"
44293,44294,King John,98.0,2.1.504,KING JOHN,Holds hand with any princess of the world.
44294,44295,King John,99.0,2.1.505,KING PHILIP,"What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face."
44295,44296,King John,100.0,2.1.506,LEWIS,"I do, my lord, and in her eye I find"
44296,44297,King John,100.0,2.1.507,LEWIS,"A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,"
44297,44298,King John,100.0,2.1.508,LEWIS,The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:
44298,44299,King John,100.0,2.1.509,LEWIS,"Which being but the shadow of your son,"
44299,44300,King John,100.0,2.1.510,LEWIS,Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:
44300,44301,King John,100.0,2.1.511,LEWIS,I do protest I never loved myself
44301,44302,King John,100.0,2.1.512,LEWIS,Till now infixed I beheld myself
44302,44303,King John,100.0,2.1.513,LEWIS,Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
44303,44304,King John,100.0,,LEWIS,Whispers with BLANCH
44304,44305,King John,101.0,2.1.514,BASTARD,Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
44305,44306,King John,101.0,2.1.515,BASTARD,Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
44306,44307,King John,101.0,2.1.516,BASTARD,And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
44307,44308,King John,101.0,2.1.517,BASTARD,"Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,"
44308,44309,King John,101.0,2.1.518,BASTARD,"That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be"
44309,44310,King John,101.0,2.1.519,BASTARD,In such a love so vile a lout as he.
44310,44311,King John,102.0,2.1.520,BLANCH,My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
44311,44312,King John,102.0,2.1.521,BLANCH,"If he see aught in you that makes him like,"
44312,44313,King John,102.0,2.1.522,BLANCH,"That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,"
44313,44314,King John,102.0,2.1.523,BLANCH,"I can with ease translate it to my will,"
44314,44315,King John,102.0,2.1.524,BLANCH,"Or if you will, to speak more properly,"
44315,44316,King John,102.0,2.1.525,BLANCH,I will enforce it easily to my love.
44316,44317,King John,102.0,2.1.526,BLANCH,"Further I will not flatter you, my lord,"
44317,44318,King John,102.0,2.1.527,BLANCH,"That all I see in you is worthy love,"
44318,44319,King John,102.0,2.1.528,BLANCH,"Than this, that nothing do I see in you,"
44319,44320,King John,102.0,2.1.529,BLANCH,"Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,"
44320,44321,King John,102.0,2.1.530,BLANCH,That I can find should merit any hate.
44321,44322,King John,103.0,2.1.531,KING JOHN,What say these young ones? What say you my niece?
44322,44323,King John,104.0,2.1.532,BLANCH,That she is bound in honour still to do
44323,44324,King John,104.0,2.1.533,BLANCH,What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
44324,44325,King John,105.0,2.1.534,KING JOHN,"Speak then, prince Dauphin, can you love this lady?"
44325,44326,King John,106.0,2.1.535,LEWIS,"Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love,"
44326,44327,King John,106.0,2.1.536,LEWIS,For I do love her most unfeignedly.
44327,44328,King John,107.0,2.1.537,KING JOHN,"Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,"
44328,44329,King John,107.0,2.1.538,KING JOHN,"Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,"
44329,44330,King John,107.0,2.1.539,KING JOHN,"With her to thee, and this addition more,"
44330,44331,King John,107.0,2.1.540,KING JOHN,Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
44331,44332,King John,107.0,2.1.541,KING JOHN,"Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,"
44332,44333,King John,107.0,2.1.542,KING JOHN,Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
44333,44334,King John,108.0,2.1.543,KING PHILIP,"It likes us well, young princes, close your hands."
44334,44335,King John,109.0,2.1.544,AUSTRIA,"And your lips too, for I am well assured"
44335,44336,King John,109.0,2.1.545,AUSTRIA,That I did so when I was first assured.
44336,44337,King John,110.0,2.1.546,KING PHILIP,"Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,"
44337,44338,King John,110.0,2.1.547,KING PHILIP,"Let in that amity which you have made,"
44338,44339,King John,110.0,2.1.548,KING PHILIP,For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
44339,44340,King John,110.0,2.1.549,KING PHILIP,The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
44340,44341,King John,110.0,2.1.550,KING PHILIP,Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
44341,44342,King John,110.0,2.1.551,KING PHILIP,"I know she is not, for this match made up"
44342,44343,King John,110.0,2.1.552,KING PHILIP,Her presence would have interrupted much:
44343,44344,King John,110.0,2.1.553,KING PHILIP,"Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows."
44344,44345,King John,111.0,2.1.554,LEWIS,She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
44345,44346,King John,112.0,2.1.555,KING PHILIP,"And, by my faith, this league that we have made"
44346,44347,King John,112.0,2.1.556,KING PHILIP,Will give her sadness very little cure.
44347,44348,King John,112.0,2.1.557,KING PHILIP,"Brother of England, how may we content"
44348,44349,King John,112.0,2.1.558,KING PHILIP,"This widow lady? In her right we came,"
44349,44350,King John,112.0,2.1.559,KING PHILIP,"Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,"
44350,44351,King John,112.0,2.1.560,KING PHILIP,To our own vantage.
44351,44352,King John,113.0,2.1.561,KING JOHN,"We will heal up all,"
44352,44353,King John,113.0,2.1.562,KING JOHN,For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
44353,44354,King John,113.0,2.1.563,KING JOHN,"And Earl of Richmond, and this rich fair town"
44354,44355,King John,113.0,2.1.564,KING JOHN,"We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance,"
44355,44356,King John,113.0,2.1.565,KING JOHN,Some speedy messenger bid her repair
44356,44357,King John,113.0,2.1.566,KING JOHN,"To our solemnity: I trust we shall,"
44357,44358,King John,113.0,2.1.567,KING JOHN,"If not fill up the measure of her will,"
44358,44359,King John,113.0,2.1.568,KING JOHN,Yet in some measure satisfy her so
44359,44360,King John,113.0,2.1.569,KING JOHN,That we shall stop her exclamation.
44360,44361,King John,113.0,2.1.570,KING JOHN,"Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,"
44361,44362,King John,113.0,2.1.571,KING JOHN,"To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp."
44362,44363,King John,113.0,,KING JOHN,Exeunt all but the BASTARD
44363,44364,King John,114.0,2.1.572,BASTARD,Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
44364,44365,King John,114.0,2.1.573,BASTARD,"John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,"
44365,44366,King John,114.0,2.1.574,BASTARD,"Hath willingly departed with a part,"
44366,44367,King John,114.0,2.1.575,BASTARD,"And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,"
44367,44368,King John,114.0,2.1.576,BASTARD,Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
44368,44369,King John,114.0,2.1.577,BASTARD,"As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear"
44369,44370,King John,114.0,2.1.578,BASTARD,"With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,"
44370,44371,King John,114.0,2.1.579,BASTARD,"That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,"
44371,44372,King John,114.0,2.1.580,BASTARD,"That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,"
44372,44373,King John,114.0,2.1.581,BASTARD,"Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,"
44373,44374,King John,114.0,2.1.582,BASTARD,"Who, having no external thing to lose"
44374,44375,King John,114.0,2.1.583,BASTARD,"But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,"
44375,44376,King John,114.0,2.1.584,BASTARD,"That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,"
44376,44377,King John,114.0,2.1.585,BASTARD,"Commodity, the bias of the world,"
44377,44378,King John,114.0,2.1.586,BASTARD,"The world, who of itself is peised well,"
44378,44379,King John,114.0,2.1.587,BASTARD,"Made to run even upon even ground,"
44379,44380,King John,114.0,2.1.588,BASTARD,"Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,"
44380,44381,King John,114.0,2.1.589,BASTARD,"This sway of motion, this Commodity,"
44381,44382,King John,114.0,2.1.590,BASTARD,"Makes it take head from all indifferency,"
44382,44383,King John,114.0,2.1.591,BASTARD,"From all direction, purpose, course, intent:"
44383,44384,King John,114.0,2.1.592,BASTARD,"And this same bias, this Commodity,"
44384,44385,King John,114.0,2.1.593,BASTARD,"This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,"
44385,44386,King John,114.0,2.1.594,BASTARD,"Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,"
44386,44387,King John,114.0,2.1.595,BASTARD,"Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,"
44387,44388,King John,114.0,2.1.596,BASTARD,"From a resolved and honourable war,"
44388,44389,King John,114.0,2.1.597,BASTARD,To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
44389,44390,King John,114.0,2.1.598,BASTARD,And why rail I on this Commodity?
44390,44391,King John,114.0,2.1.599,BASTARD,But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
44391,44392,King John,114.0,2.1.600,BASTARD,"Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,"
44392,44393,King John,114.0,2.1.601,BASTARD,"When his fair angels would salute my palm,"
44393,44394,King John,114.0,2.1.602,BASTARD,"But for my hand, as unattempted yet,"
44394,44395,King John,114.0,2.1.603,BASTARD,"Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich."
44395,44396,King John,114.0,2.1.604,BASTARD,"Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail"
44396,44397,King John,114.0,2.1.605,BASTARD,"And say there is no sin but to be rich,"
44397,44398,King John,114.0,2.1.606,BASTARD,"And being rich, my virtue then shall be"
44398,44399,King John,114.0,2.1.607,BASTARD,To say there is no vice but beggary.
44399,44400,King John,114.0,2.1.608,BASTARD,"Since kings break faith upon commodity,"
44400,44401,King John,114.0,2.1.609,BASTARD,"Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee."
44401,44402,King John,114.0,,BASTARD,Exit
44402,44403,King John,114.0,,BASTARD,ACT III
44403,44404,King John,114.0,,BASTARD,SCENE I. The French King's pavilion.
44404,44405,King John,114.0,,BASTARD,"Enter CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, and SALISBURY"
44405,44406,King John,1.0,3.1.1,CONSTANCE,Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
44406,44407,King John,1.0,3.1.2,CONSTANCE,False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
44407,44408,King John,1.0,3.1.3,CONSTANCE,"Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?"
44408,44409,King John,1.0,3.1.4,CONSTANCE,"It is not so, thou hast misspoke, misheard:"
44409,44410,King John,1.0,3.1.5,CONSTANCE,"Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:"
44410,44411,King John,1.0,3.1.6,CONSTANCE,"It cannot be, thou dost but say 'tis so:"
44411,44412,King John,1.0,3.1.7,CONSTANCE,"I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word"
44412,44413,King John,1.0,3.1.8,CONSTANCE,Is but the vain breath of a common man:
44413,44414,King John,1.0,3.1.9,CONSTANCE,"Believe me, I do not believe thee, man,"
44414,44415,King John,1.0,3.1.10,CONSTANCE,I have a king's oath to the contrary.
44415,44416,King John,1.0,3.1.11,CONSTANCE,"Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,"
44416,44417,King John,1.0,3.1.12,CONSTANCE,"For I am sick and capable of fears,"
44417,44418,King John,1.0,3.1.13,CONSTANCE,"Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,"
44418,44419,King John,1.0,3.1.14,CONSTANCE,"A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,"
44419,44420,King John,1.0,3.1.15,CONSTANCE,"A woman, naturally born to fears,"
44420,44421,King John,1.0,3.1.16,CONSTANCE,"And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,"
44421,44422,King John,1.0,3.1.17,CONSTANCE,"With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,"
44422,44423,King John,1.0,3.1.18,CONSTANCE,But they will quake and tremble all this day.
44423,44424,King John,1.0,3.1.19,CONSTANCE,What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
44424,44425,King John,1.0,3.1.20,CONSTANCE,Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
44425,44426,King John,1.0,3.1.21,CONSTANCE,What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
44426,44427,King John,1.0,3.1.22,CONSTANCE,"Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,"
44427,44428,King John,1.0,3.1.23,CONSTANCE,Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
44428,44429,King John,1.0,3.1.24,CONSTANCE,Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
44429,44430,King John,1.0,3.1.25,CONSTANCE,"Then speak again, not all thy former tale,"
44430,44431,King John,1.0,3.1.26,CONSTANCE,"But this one word, whether thy tale be true."
44431,44432,King John,2.0,3.1.27,SALISBURY,As true as I believe you think them false
44432,44433,King John,2.0,3.1.28,SALISBURY,That give you cause to prove my saying true.
44433,44434,King John,3.0,3.1.29,CONSTANCE,"O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,"
44434,44435,King John,3.0,3.1.30,CONSTANCE,"Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,"
44435,44436,King John,3.0,3.1.31,CONSTANCE,And let belief and life encounter so
44436,44437,King John,3.0,3.1.32,CONSTANCE,As doth the fury of two desperate men
44437,44438,King John,3.0,3.1.33,CONSTANCE,Which in the very meeting fall and die.
44438,44439,King John,3.0,3.1.34,CONSTANCE,"Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?"
44439,44440,King John,3.0,3.1.35,CONSTANCE,"France friend with England, what becomes of me?"
44440,44441,King John,3.0,3.1.36,CONSTANCE,"Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:"
44441,44442,King John,3.0,3.1.37,CONSTANCE,This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
44442,44443,King John,4.0,3.1.38,SALISBURY,"What other harm have I, good lady, done,"
44443,44444,King John,4.0,3.1.39,SALISBURY,But spoke the harm that is by others done?
44444,44445,King John,5.0,3.1.40,CONSTANCE,Which harm within itself so heinous is
44445,44446,King John,5.0,3.1.41,CONSTANCE,As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
44446,44447,King John,6.0,3.1.42,ARTHUR,"I do beseech you, madam, be content."
44447,44448,King John,7.0,3.1.43,CONSTANCE,"If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,"
44448,44449,King John,7.0,3.1.44,CONSTANCE,"Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,"
44449,44450,King John,7.0,3.1.45,CONSTANCE,"Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,"
44450,44451,King John,7.0,3.1.46,CONSTANCE,"Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,"
44451,44452,King John,7.0,3.1.47,CONSTANCE,"Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,"
44452,44453,King John,7.0,3.1.48,CONSTANCE,"I would not care, I then would be content,"
44453,44454,King John,7.0,3.1.49,CONSTANCE,"For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou"
44454,44455,King John,7.0,3.1.50,CONSTANCE,Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
44455,44456,King John,7.0,3.1.51,CONSTANCE,"But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,"
44456,44457,King John,7.0,3.1.52,CONSTANCE,Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
44457,44458,King John,7.0,3.1.53,CONSTANCE,"Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,"
44458,44459,King John,7.0,3.1.54,CONSTANCE,"And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,"
44459,44460,King John,7.0,3.1.55,CONSTANCE,"She is corrupted, changed and won from thee,"
44460,44461,King John,7.0,3.1.56,CONSTANCE,"She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,"
44461,44462,King John,7.0,3.1.57,CONSTANCE,And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
44462,44463,King John,7.0,3.1.58,CONSTANCE,"To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,"
44463,44464,King John,7.0,3.1.59,CONSTANCE,And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
44464,44465,King John,7.0,3.1.60,CONSTANCE,"France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,"
44465,44466,King John,7.0,3.1.61,CONSTANCE,"That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!"
44466,44467,King John,7.0,3.1.62,CONSTANCE,"Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?"
44467,44468,King John,7.0,3.1.63,CONSTANCE,"Envenom him with words, or get thee gone"
44468,44469,King John,7.0,3.1.64,CONSTANCE,And leave those woes alone which I alone
44469,44470,King John,7.0,3.1.65,CONSTANCE,Am bound to under-bear.
44470,44471,King John,8.0,3.1.66,SALISBURY,"Pardon me, madam,"
44471,44472,King John,8.0,3.1.67,SALISBURY,I may not go without you to the kings.
44472,44473,King John,9.0,3.1.68,CONSTANCE,"Thou mayst, thou shalt, I will not go with thee:"
44473,44474,King John,9.0,3.1.69,CONSTANCE,"I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,"
44474,44475,King John,9.0,3.1.70,CONSTANCE,For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
44475,44476,King John,9.0,3.1.71,CONSTANCE,To me and to the state of my great grief
44476,44477,King John,9.0,3.1.72,CONSTANCE,"Let kings assemble, for my grief's so great"
44477,44478,King John,9.0,3.1.73,CONSTANCE,That no supporter but the huge firm earth
44478,44479,King John,9.0,3.1.74,CONSTANCE,"Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit,"
44479,44480,King John,9.0,3.1.75,CONSTANCE,"Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it."
44480,44481,King John,9.0,,CONSTANCE,Seats herself on the ground
44481,44482,King John,9.0,,CONSTANCE,"Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILLIP, LEWIS, BLANCH, QUEEN ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and Attendants"
44482,44483,King John,10.0,3.1.76,KING PHILIP,"'Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day"
44483,44484,King John,10.0,3.1.77,KING PHILIP,Ever in France shall be kept festival:
44484,44485,King John,10.0,3.1.78,KING PHILIP,To solemnize this day the glorious sun
44485,44486,King John,10.0,3.1.79,KING PHILIP,"Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,"
44486,44487,King John,10.0,3.1.80,KING PHILIP,Turning with splendor of his precious eye
44487,44488,King John,10.0,3.1.81,KING PHILIP,The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:
44488,44489,King John,10.0,3.1.82,KING PHILIP,The yearly course that brings this day about
44489,44490,King John,10.0,3.1.83,KING PHILIP,Shall never see it but a holiday.
44490,44491,King John,11.0,3.1.84,CONSTANCE,"A wicked day, and not a holy day!"
44491,44492,King John,11.0,,CONSTANCE,Rising
44492,44493,King John,11.0,3.1.85,CONSTANCE,"What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,"
44493,44494,King John,11.0,3.1.86,CONSTANCE,That it in golden letters should be set
44494,44495,King John,11.0,3.1.87,CONSTANCE,Among the high tides in the calendar?
44495,44496,King John,11.0,3.1.88,CONSTANCE,"Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,"
44496,44497,King John,11.0,3.1.89,CONSTANCE,"This day of shame, oppression, perjury."
44497,44498,King John,11.0,3.1.90,CONSTANCE,"Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child"
44498,44499,King John,11.0,3.1.91,CONSTANCE,"Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,"
44499,44500,King John,11.0,3.1.92,CONSTANCE,Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:
44500,44501,King John,11.0,3.1.93,CONSTANCE,"But on this day let seamen fear no wreck,"
44501,44502,King John,11.0,3.1.94,CONSTANCE,No bargains break that are not this day made:
44502,44503,King John,11.0,3.1.95,CONSTANCE,"This day, all things begun come to ill end,"
44503,44504,King John,11.0,3.1.96,CONSTANCE,"Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!"
44504,44505,King John,12.0,3.1.97,KING PHILIP,"By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause"
44505,44506,King John,12.0,3.1.98,KING PHILIP,To curse the fair proceedings of this day:
44506,44507,King John,12.0,3.1.99,KING PHILIP,Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?
44507,44508,King John,13.0,3.1.100,CONSTANCE,You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
44508,44509,King John,13.0,3.1.101,CONSTANCE,"Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,"
44509,44510,King John,13.0,3.1.102,CONSTANCE,"Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn,"
44510,44511,King John,13.0,3.1.103,CONSTANCE,"You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,"
44511,44512,King John,13.0,3.1.104,CONSTANCE,But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
44512,44513,King John,13.0,3.1.105,CONSTANCE,The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
44513,44514,King John,13.0,3.1.106,CONSTANCE,"Is cold in amity and painted peace,"
44514,44515,King John,13.0,3.1.107,CONSTANCE,And our oppression hath made up this league.
44515,44516,King John,13.0,3.1.108,CONSTANCE,"Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!"
44516,44517,King John,13.0,3.1.109,CONSTANCE,"A widow cries, be husband to me, heavens!"
44517,44518,King John,13.0,3.1.110,CONSTANCE,Let not the hours of this ungodly day
44518,44519,King John,13.0,3.1.111,CONSTANCE,"Wear out the day in peace, but, ere sunset,"
44519,44520,King John,13.0,3.1.112,CONSTANCE,Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!
44520,44521,King John,13.0,3.1.113,CONSTANCE,"Hear me, O, hear me!"
44521,44522,King John,14.0,3.1.114,AUSTRIA,"Lady Constance, peace!"
44522,44523,King John,15.0,3.1.115,CONSTANCE,War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war
44523,44524,King John,15.0,3.1.116,CONSTANCE,O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
44524,44525,King John,15.0,3.1.117,CONSTANCE,"That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!"
44525,44526,King John,15.0,3.1.118,CONSTANCE,"Thou little valiant, great in villany!"
44526,44527,King John,15.0,3.1.119,CONSTANCE,Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
44527,44528,King John,15.0,3.1.120,CONSTANCE,Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
44528,44529,King John,15.0,3.1.121,CONSTANCE,But when her humorous ladyship is by
44529,44530,King John,15.0,3.1.122,CONSTANCE,"To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,"
44530,44531,King John,15.0,3.1.123,CONSTANCE,"And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,"
44531,44532,King John,15.0,3.1.124,CONSTANCE,"A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear"
44532,44533,King John,15.0,3.1.125,CONSTANCE,"Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,"
44533,44534,King John,15.0,3.1.126,CONSTANCE,"Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,"
44534,44535,King John,15.0,3.1.127,CONSTANCE,"Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend"
44535,44536,King John,15.0,3.1.128,CONSTANCE,"Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,"
44536,44537,King John,15.0,3.1.129,CONSTANCE,And dost thou now fall over to my fores?
44537,44538,King John,15.0,3.1.130,CONSTANCE,"Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,"
44538,44539,King John,15.0,3.1.131,CONSTANCE,And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
44539,44540,King John,16.0,3.1.132,AUSTRIA,"O, that a man should speak those words to me!"
44540,44541,King John,17.0,3.1.133,BASTARD,And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
44541,44542,King John,18.0,3.1.134,AUSTRIA,"Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life."
44542,44543,King John,19.0,3.1.135,BASTARD,And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
44543,44544,King John,20.0,3.1.136,KING JOHN,"We like not this, thou dost forget thyself."
44544,44545,King John,20.0,,KING JOHN,Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
44545,44546,King John,21.0,3.1.137,KING PHILIP,Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
44546,44547,King John,22.0,3.1.138,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!"
44547,44548,King John,22.0,3.1.139,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To thee, King John, my holy errand is."
44548,44549,King John,22.0,3.1.140,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,"
44549,44550,King John,22.0,3.1.141,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And from Pope Innocent the legate here,"
44550,44551,King John,22.0,3.1.142,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Do in his name religiously demand
44551,44552,King John,22.0,3.1.143,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Why thou against the church, our holy mother,"
44552,44553,King John,22.0,3.1.144,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So wilfully dost spurn, and force perforce"
44553,44554,King John,22.0,3.1.145,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop"
44554,44555,King John,22.0,3.1.146,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Of Canterbury, from that holy see?"
44555,44556,King John,22.0,3.1.147,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"This, in our foresaid holy father's name,"
44556,44557,King John,22.0,3.1.148,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee."
44557,44558,King John,23.0,3.1.149,KING JOHN,What earthy name to interrogatories
44558,44559,King John,23.0,3.1.150,KING JOHN,Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
44559,44560,King John,23.0,3.1.151,KING JOHN,"Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name"
44560,44561,King John,23.0,3.1.152,KING JOHN,"So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,"
44561,44562,King John,23.0,3.1.153,KING JOHN,"To charge me to an answer, as the pope."
44562,44563,King John,23.0,3.1.154,KING JOHN,"Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England"
44563,44564,King John,23.0,3.1.155,KING JOHN,"Add thus much more, that no Italian priest"
44564,44565,King John,23.0,3.1.156,KING JOHN,"Shall tithe or toll in our dominions,"
44565,44566,King John,23.0,3.1.157,KING JOHN,"But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,"
44566,44567,King John,23.0,3.1.158,KING JOHN,"So under Him that great supremacy,"
44567,44568,King John,23.0,3.1.159,KING JOHN,"Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,"
44568,44569,King John,23.0,3.1.160,KING JOHN,Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
44569,44570,King John,23.0,3.1.161,KING JOHN,"So tell the pope, all reverence set apart"
44570,44571,King John,23.0,3.1.162,KING JOHN,To him and his usurp'd authority.
44571,44572,King John,24.0,3.1.163,KING PHILIP,"Brother of England, you blaspheme in this."
44572,44573,King John,25.0,3.1.164,KING JOHN,Though you and all the kings of Christendom
44573,44574,King John,25.0,3.1.165,KING JOHN,"Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,"
44574,44575,King John,25.0,3.1.166,KING JOHN,"Dreading the curse that money may buy out,"
44575,44576,King John,25.0,3.1.167,KING JOHN,"And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,"
44576,44577,King John,25.0,3.1.168,KING JOHN,"Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,"
44577,44578,King John,25.0,3.1.169,KING JOHN,"Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,"
44578,44579,King John,25.0,3.1.170,KING JOHN,Though you and all the rest so grossly led
44579,44580,King John,25.0,3.1.171,KING JOHN,"This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,"
44580,44581,King John,25.0,3.1.172,KING JOHN,"Yet I alone, alone do me oppose"
44581,44582,King John,25.0,3.1.173,KING JOHN,Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
44582,44583,King John,26.0,3.1.174,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Then, by the lawful power that I have,"
44583,44584,King John,26.0,3.1.175,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.
44584,44585,King John,26.0,3.1.176,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
44585,44586,King John,26.0,3.1.177,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"From his allegiance to an heretic,"
44586,44587,King John,26.0,3.1.178,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,"
44587,44588,King John,26.0,3.1.179,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Canonized and worshipped as a saint,"
44588,44589,King John,26.0,3.1.180,CARDINAL PANDULPH,That takes away by any secret course
44589,44590,King John,26.0,3.1.181,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Thy hateful life.
44590,44591,King John,27.0,3.1.182,CONSTANCE,"O, lawful let it be"
44591,44592,King John,27.0,3.1.183,CONSTANCE,That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
44592,44593,King John,27.0,3.1.184,CONSTANCE,"Good father cardinal, cry thou amen"
44593,44594,King John,27.0,3.1.185,CONSTANCE,"To my keen curses, for without my wrong"
44594,44595,King John,27.0,3.1.186,CONSTANCE,There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
44595,44596,King John,28.0,3.1.187,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse."
44596,44597,King John,29.0,3.1.188,CONSTANCE,"And for mine too: when law can do no right,"
44597,44598,King John,29.0,3.1.189,CONSTANCE,Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
44598,44599,King John,29.0,3.1.190,CONSTANCE,"Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,"
44599,44600,King John,29.0,3.1.191,CONSTANCE,"For he that holds his kingdom holds the law,"
44600,44601,King John,29.0,3.1.192,CONSTANCE,"Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,"
44601,44602,King John,29.0,3.1.193,CONSTANCE,How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
44602,44603,King John,30.0,3.1.194,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Philip of France, on peril of a curse,"
44603,44604,King John,30.0,3.1.195,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,"
44604,44605,King John,30.0,3.1.196,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And raise the power of France upon his head,"
44605,44606,King John,30.0,3.1.197,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
44606,44607,King John,31.0,3.1.198,QUEEN ELINOR,"Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand."
44607,44608,King John,32.0,3.1.199,CONSTANCE,"Look to that, devil, lest that France repent,"
44608,44609,King John,32.0,3.1.200,CONSTANCE,"And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul."
44609,44610,King John,33.0,3.1.201,AUSTRIA,"King Philip, listen to the cardinal."
44610,44611,King John,34.0,3.1.202,BASTARD,And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
44611,44612,King John,35.0,3.1.203,AUSTRIA,"Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--"
44612,44613,King John,36.0,3.1.204,BASTARD,Your breeches best may carry them.
44613,44614,King John,37.0,3.1.205,KING JOHN,"Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?"
44614,44615,King John,38.0,3.1.206,CONSTANCE,"What should he say, but as the cardinal?"
44615,44616,King John,39.0,3.1.207,LEWIS,"Bethink you, father, for the difference"
44616,44617,King John,39.0,3.1.208,LEWIS,"Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,"
44617,44618,King John,39.0,3.1.209,LEWIS,Or the light loss of England for a friend:
44618,44619,King John,39.0,3.1.210,LEWIS,Forego the easier.
44619,44620,King John,40.0,3.1.211,BLANCH,That's the curse of Rome.
44620,44621,King John,41.0,3.1.212,CONSTANCE,"O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here"
44621,44622,King John,41.0,3.1.213,CONSTANCE,In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
44622,44623,King John,42.0,3.1.214,BLANCH,"The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,"
44623,44624,King John,42.0,3.1.215,BLANCH,But from her need.
44624,44625,King John,43.0,3.1.216,CONSTANCE,"O, if thou grant my need,"
44625,44626,King John,43.0,3.1.217,CONSTANCE,"Which only lives but by the death of faith,"
44626,44627,King John,43.0,3.1.218,CONSTANCE,"That need must needs infer this principle,"
44627,44628,King John,43.0,3.1.219,CONSTANCE,That faith would live again by death of need.
44628,44629,King John,43.0,3.1.220,CONSTANCE,"O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up,"
44629,44630,King John,43.0,3.1.221,CONSTANCE,"Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!"
44630,44631,King John,44.0,3.1.222,KING JOHN,"The king is moved, and answers not to this."
44631,44632,King John,45.0,3.1.223,CONSTANCE,"O, be removed from him, and answer well!"
44632,44633,King John,46.0,3.1.224,AUSTRIA,"Do so, King Philip, hang no more in doubt."
44633,44634,King John,47.0,3.1.225,BASTARD,"Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout."
44634,44635,King John,48.0,3.1.226,KING PHILIP,"I am perplex'd, and know not what to say."
44635,44636,King John,49.0,3.1.227,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,"
44636,44637,King John,49.0,3.1.228,CARDINAL PANDULPH,If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
44637,44638,King John,50.0,3.1.229,KING PHILIP,"Good reverend father, make my person yours,"
44638,44639,King John,50.0,3.1.230,KING PHILIP,And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
44639,44640,King John,50.0,3.1.231,KING PHILIP,"This royal hand and mine are newly knit,"
44640,44641,King John,50.0,3.1.232,KING PHILIP,And the conjunction of our inward souls
44641,44642,King John,50.0,3.1.233,KING PHILIP,"Married in league, coupled and linked together"
44642,44643,King John,50.0,3.1.234,KING PHILIP,"With all religious strength of sacred vows,"
44643,44644,King John,50.0,3.1.235,KING PHILIP,The latest breath that gave the sound of words
44644,44645,King John,50.0,3.1.236,KING PHILIP,"Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love"
44645,44646,King John,50.0,3.1.237,KING PHILIP,"Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,"
44646,44647,King John,50.0,3.1.238,KING PHILIP,"And even before this truce, but new before,"
44647,44648,King John,50.0,3.1.239,KING PHILIP,No longer than we well could wash our hands
44648,44649,King John,50.0,3.1.240,KING PHILIP,"To clap this royal bargain up of peace,"
44649,44650,King John,50.0,3.1.241,KING PHILIP,"Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd"
44650,44651,King John,50.0,3.1.242,KING PHILIP,"With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint"
44651,44652,King John,50.0,3.1.243,KING PHILIP,The fearful difference of incensed kings:
44652,44653,King John,50.0,3.1.244,KING PHILIP,"And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,"
44653,44654,King John,50.0,3.1.245,KING PHILIP,"So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,"
44654,44655,King John,50.0,3.1.246,KING PHILIP,Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
44655,44656,King John,50.0,3.1.247,KING PHILIP,"Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,"
44656,44657,King John,50.0,3.1.248,KING PHILIP,"Make such unconstant children of ourselves,"
44657,44658,King John,50.0,3.1.249,KING PHILIP,"As now again to snatch our palm from palm,"
44658,44659,King John,50.0,3.1.250,KING PHILIP,"Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed"
44659,44660,King John,50.0,3.1.251,KING PHILIP,"Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,"
44660,44661,King John,50.0,3.1.252,KING PHILIP,And make a riot on the gentle brow
44661,44662,King John,50.0,3.1.253,KING PHILIP,"Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,"
44662,44663,King John,50.0,3.1.254,KING PHILIP,"My reverend father, let it not be so!"
44663,44664,King John,50.0,3.1.255,KING PHILIP,"Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose"
44664,44665,King John,50.0,3.1.256,KING PHILIP,"Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest"
44665,44666,King John,50.0,3.1.257,KING PHILIP,To do your pleasure and continue friends.
44666,44667,King John,51.0,3.1.258,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"All form is formless, order orderless,"
44667,44668,King John,51.0,3.1.259,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Save what is opposite to England's love.
44668,44669,King John,51.0,3.1.260,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,"
44669,44670,King John,51.0,3.1.261,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,"
44670,44671,King John,51.0,3.1.262,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"A mother's curse, on her revolting son."
44671,44672,King John,51.0,3.1.263,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,"
44672,44673,King John,51.0,3.1.264,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"A chafed lion by the mortal paw,"
44673,44674,King John,51.0,3.1.265,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,"
44674,44675,King John,51.0,3.1.266,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
44675,44676,King John,52.0,3.1.267,KING PHILIP,"I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith."
44676,44677,King John,53.0,3.1.268,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So makest thou faith an enemy to faith,"
44677,44678,King John,53.0,3.1.269,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,"
44678,44679,King John,53.0,3.1.270,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow"
44679,44680,King John,53.0,3.1.271,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,"
44680,44681,King John,53.0,3.1.272,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That is, to be the champion of our church!"
44681,44682,King John,53.0,3.1.273,CARDINAL PANDULPH,What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
44682,44683,King John,53.0,3.1.274,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And may not be performed by thyself,"
44683,44684,King John,53.0,3.1.275,CARDINAL PANDULPH,For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
44684,44685,King John,53.0,3.1.276,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is not amiss when it is truly done,"
44685,44686,King John,53.0,3.1.277,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And being not done, where doing tends to ill,"
44686,44687,King John,53.0,3.1.278,CARDINAL PANDULPH,The truth is then most done not doing it:
44687,44688,King John,53.0,3.1.279,CARDINAL PANDULPH,The better act of purposes mistook
44688,44689,King John,53.0,3.1.280,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is to mistake again, though indirect,"
44689,44690,King John,53.0,3.1.281,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Yet indirection thereby grows direct,"
44690,44691,King John,53.0,3.1.282,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire"
44691,44692,King John,53.0,3.1.283,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
44692,44693,King John,53.0,3.1.284,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"It is religion that doth make vows kept,"
44693,44694,King John,53.0,3.1.285,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But thou hast sworn against religion,"
44694,44695,King John,53.0,3.1.286,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,"
44695,44696,King John,53.0,3.1.287,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
44696,44697,King John,53.0,3.1.288,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
44697,44698,King John,53.0,3.1.289,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To swear, swears only not to be forsworn,"
44698,44699,King John,53.0,3.1.290,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
44699,44700,King John,53.0,3.1.291,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,"
44700,44701,King John,53.0,3.1.292,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear."
44701,44702,King John,53.0,3.1.293,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Therefore thy later vows against thy first
44702,44703,King John,53.0,3.1.294,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is in thyself rebellion to thyself,"
44703,44704,King John,53.0,3.1.295,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And better conquest never canst thou make
44704,44705,King John,53.0,3.1.296,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
44705,44706,King John,53.0,3.1.297,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Against these giddy loose suggestions:
44706,44707,King John,53.0,3.1.298,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Upon which better part our prayers come in,"
44707,44708,King John,53.0,3.1.299,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know"
44708,44709,King John,53.0,3.1.300,CARDINAL PANDULPH,The peril of our curses light on thee
44709,44710,King John,53.0,3.1.301,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,"
44710,44711,King John,53.0,3.1.302,CARDINAL PANDULPH,But in despair die under their black weight.
44711,44712,King John,54.0,3.1.303,AUSTRIA,"Rebellion, flat rebellion!"
44712,44713,King John,55.0,3.1.304,BASTARD,Will't not be?
44713,44714,King John,55.0,3.1.305,BASTARD,Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?
44714,44715,King John,56.0,3.1.306,LEWIS,"Father, to arms!"
44715,44716,King John,57.0,3.1.307,BLANCH,Upon thy wedding-day?
44716,44717,King John,57.0,3.1.308,BLANCH,Against the blood that thou hast married?
44717,44718,King John,57.0,3.1.309,BLANCH,"What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?"
44718,44719,King John,57.0,3.1.310,BLANCH,"Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,"
44719,44720,King John,57.0,3.1.311,BLANCH,"Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?"
44720,44721,King John,57.0,3.1.312,BLANCH,"O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new"
44721,44722,King John,57.0,3.1.313,BLANCH,"Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,"

44723,44724,King John,57.0,3.1.315,BLANCH,"Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms"
44724,44725,King John,57.0,3.1.316,BLANCH,Against mine uncle.
44725,44726,King John,58.0,3.1.317,CONSTANCE,"O, upon my knee,"

44730,44731,King John,59.0,3.1.322,BLANCH,Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

44735,44736,King John,62.0,3.1.327,CARDINAL PANDULPH,I will denounce a curse upon his head.
44736,44737,King John,63.0,3.1.328,KING PHILIP,"Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee."
44737,44738,King John,64.0,3.1.329,CONSTANCE,O fair return of banish'd majesty!
44738,44739,King John,65.0,3.1.330,QUEEN ELINOR,O foul revolt of French inconstancy!

44952,44953,King John,16.0,3.4.80,CONSTANCE,"If that be true, I shall see my boy again,"
44953,44954,King John,16.0,3.4.81,CONSTANCE,"For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,"
44954,44955,King John,16.0,3.4.82,CONSTANCE,"To him that did but yesterday suspire,"
44955,44956,King John,16.0,3.4.83,CONSTANCE,There was not such a gracious creature born.
44956,44957,King John,16.0,3.4.84,CONSTANCE,But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
44957,44958,King John,16.0,3.4.85,CONSTANCE,And chase the native beauty from his cheek
44958,44959,King John,16.0,3.4.86,CONSTANCE,"And he will look as hollow as a ghost,"
44959,44960,King John,16.0,3.4.87,CONSTANCE,"As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,"
44960,44961,King John,16.0,3.4.88,CONSTANCE,"And so he'll die, and, rising so again,"
44961,44962,King John,16.0,3.4.89,CONSTANCE,When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
44962,44963,King John,16.0,3.4.90,CONSTANCE,"I shall not know him: therefore never, never"
44963,44964,King John,16.0,3.4.91,CONSTANCE,Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
44964,44965,King John,17.0,3.4.92,CARDINAL PANDULPH,You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
44965,44966,King John,18.0,3.4.93,CONSTANCE,He talks to me that never had a son.
44966,44967,King John,19.0,3.4.94,KING PHILIP,You are as fond of grief as of your child.
44967,44968,King John,20.0,3.4.95,CONSTANCE,"Grief fills the room up of my absent child,"
44968,44969,King John,20.0,3.4.96,CONSTANCE,"Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,"
44969,44970,King John,20.0,3.4.97,CONSTANCE,"Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,"
44970,44971,King John,20.0,3.4.98,CONSTANCE,"Remembers me of all his gracious parts,"
44971,44972,King John,20.0,3.4.99,CONSTANCE,"Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form,"
44972,44973,King John,20.0,3.4.100,CONSTANCE,"Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?"
44973,44974,King John,20.0,3.4.101,CONSTANCE,"Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,"
44974,44975,King John,20.0,3.4.102,CONSTANCE,I could give better comfort than you do.
44975,44976,King John,20.0,3.4.103,CONSTANCE,"I will not keep this form upon my head,"
44976,44977,King John,20.0,3.4.104,CONSTANCE,When there is such disorder in my wit.
44977,44978,King John,20.0,3.4.105,CONSTANCE,"O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!"
44978,44979,King John,20.0,3.4.106,CONSTANCE,"My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!"
44979,44980,King John,20.0,3.4.107,CONSTANCE,"My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!"
44980,44981,King John,20.0,,CONSTANCE,Exit
44981,44982,King John,21.0,3.4.108,KING PHILIP,"I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her."
44982,44983,King John,21.0,,KING PHILIP,Exit
44983,44984,King John,22.0,3.4.109,LEWIS,There's nothing in this world can make me joy:
44984,44985,King John,22.0,3.4.110,LEWIS,Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
44985,44986,King John,22.0,3.4.111,LEWIS,"Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man,"
44986,44987,King John,22.0,3.4.112,LEWIS,And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
44987,44988,King John,22.0,3.4.113,LEWIS,That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
44988,44989,King John,23.0,3.4.114,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Before the curing of a strong disease,"
44989,44990,King John,23.0,3.4.115,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Even in the instant of repair and health,"
44990,44991,King John,23.0,3.4.116,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The fit is strongest, evils that take leave,"
44991,44992,King John,23.0,3.4.117,CARDINAL PANDULPH,On their departure most of all show evil:
44992,44993,King John,23.0,3.4.118,CARDINAL PANDULPH,What have you lost by losing of this day?
44993,44994,King John,24.0,3.4.119,LEWIS,"All days of glory, joy and happiness."
44994,44995,King John,25.0,3.4.120,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"If you had won it, certainly you had."
44995,44996,King John,25.0,3.4.121,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No, no, when Fortune means to men most good,"
44996,44997,King John,25.0,3.4.122,CARDINAL PANDULPH,She looks upon them with a threatening eye.
44997,44998,King John,25.0,3.4.123,CARDINAL PANDULPH,'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
44998,44999,King John,25.0,3.4.124,CARDINAL PANDULPH,In this which he accounts so clearly won:
44999,45000,King John,25.0,3.4.125,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?
45000,45001,King John,26.0,3.4.126,LEWIS,As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
45001,45002,King John,27.0,3.4.127,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
45002,45003,King John,27.0,3.4.128,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit,"
45003,45004,King John,27.0,3.4.129,CARDINAL PANDULPH,For even the breath of what I mean to speak
45004,45005,King John,27.0,3.4.130,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,"
45005,45006,King John,27.0,3.4.131,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Out of the path which shall directly lead
45006,45007,King John,27.0,3.4.132,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Thy foot to England's throne, and therefore mark."
45007,45008,King John,27.0,3.4.133,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"John hath seized Arthur, and it cannot be"
45008,45009,King John,27.0,3.4.134,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,"
45009,45010,King John,27.0,3.4.135,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The misplaced John should entertain an hour,"
45010,45011,King John,27.0,3.4.136,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest."
45011,45012,King John,27.0,3.4.137,CARDINAL PANDULPH,A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
45012,45013,King John,27.0,3.4.138,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd,"
45013,45014,King John,27.0,3.4.139,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And he that stands upon a slippery place
45014,45015,King John,27.0,3.4.140,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
45015,45016,King John,27.0,3.4.141,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall,"
45016,45017,King John,27.0,3.4.142,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"So be it, for it cannot be but so."
45017,45018,King John,28.0,3.4.143,LEWIS,But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
45018,45019,King John,29.0,3.4.144,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,"
45019,45020,King John,29.0,3.4.145,CARDINAL PANDULPH,May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
45020,45021,King John,30.0,3.4.146,LEWIS,"And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did."
45021,45022,King John,31.0,3.4.147,CARDINAL PANDULPH,How green you are and fresh in this old world!
45022,45023,King John,31.0,3.4.148,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"John lays you plots, the times conspire with you,"
45023,45024,King John,31.0,3.4.149,CARDINAL PANDULPH,For he that steeps his safety in true blood
45024,45025,King John,31.0,3.4.150,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
45025,45026,King John,31.0,3.4.151,CARDINAL PANDULPH,This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
45026,45027,King John,31.0,3.4.152,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,"
45027,45028,King John,31.0,3.4.153,CARDINAL PANDULPH,That none so small advantage shall step forth
45028,45029,King John,31.0,3.4.154,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it,"
45029,45030,King John,31.0,3.4.155,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No natural exhalation in the sky,"
45030,45031,King John,31.0,3.4.156,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,"
45031,45032,King John,31.0,3.4.157,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"No common wind, no customed event,"
45032,45033,King John,31.0,3.4.158,CARDINAL PANDULPH,But they will pluck away his natural cause
45033,45034,King John,31.0,3.4.159,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,"
45034,45035,King John,31.0,3.4.160,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,"
45035,45036,King John,31.0,3.4.161,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
45036,45037,King John,32.0,3.4.162,LEWIS,"May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,"
45037,45038,King John,32.0,3.4.163,LEWIS,But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
45038,45039,King John,33.0,3.4.164,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,"
45039,45040,King John,33.0,3.4.165,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"If that young Arthur be not gone already,"
45040,45041,King John,33.0,3.4.166,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Even at that news he dies, and then the hearts"
45041,45042,King John,33.0,3.4.167,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Of all his people shall revolt from him
45042,45043,King John,33.0,3.4.168,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
45043,45044,King John,33.0,3.4.169,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
45044,45045,King John,33.0,3.4.170,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
45045,45046,King John,33.0,3.4.171,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
45046,45047,King John,33.0,3.4.172,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And, O, what better matter breeds for you"
45047,45048,King John,33.0,3.4.173,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
45048,45049,King John,33.0,3.4.174,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Is now in England, ransacking the church,"
45049,45050,King John,33.0,3.4.175,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Offending charity: if but a dozen French
45050,45051,King John,33.0,3.4.176,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Were there in arms, they would be as a call"
45051,45052,King John,33.0,3.4.177,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"To train ten thousand English to their side,"
45052,45053,King John,33.0,3.4.178,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Or as a little snow, tumbled about,"
45053,45054,King John,33.0,3.4.179,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,"
45054,45055,King John,33.0,3.4.180,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
45055,45056,King John,33.0,3.4.181,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"What may be wrought out of their discontent,"
45056,45057,King John,33.0,3.4.182,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Now that their souls are topful of offence.
45057,45058,King John,33.0,3.4.183,CARDINAL PANDULPH,For England go: I will whet on the king.
45058,45059,King John,34.0,3.4.184,LEWIS,Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:
45059,45060,King John,34.0,3.4.185,LEWIS,"If you say ay, the king will not say no."
45060,45061,King John,34.0,,LEWIS,Exeunt
45061,45062,King John,34.0,,LEWIS,ACT IV
45062,45063,King John,34.0,,LEWIS,SCENE I. A room in a castle.
45063,45064,King John,34.0,,LEWIS,Enter HUBERT and Executioners
45064,45065,King John,1.0,4.1.1,HUBERT,"Heat me these irons hot, and look thou stand"
45065,45066,King John,1.0,4.1.2,HUBERT,Within the arras: when I strike my foot
45066,45067,King John,1.0,4.1.3,HUBERT,"Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,"
45067,45068,King John,1.0,4.1.4,HUBERT,And bind the boy which you shall find with me
45068,45069,King John,1.0,4.1.5,HUBERT,"Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch."
45069,45070,King John,2.0,4.1.6,First Executioner,I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
45070,45071,King John,3.0,4.1.7,HUBERT,Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
45071,45072,King John,3.0,,HUBERT,Exeunt Executioners
45072,45073,King John,3.0,4.1.8,HUBERT,"Young lad, come forth, I have to say with you."
45073,45074,King John,3.0,,HUBERT,Enter ARTHUR
45074,45075,King John,4.0,4.1.9,ARTHUR,"Good morrow, Hubert."
45075,45076,King John,5.0,4.1.10,HUBERT,"Good morrow, little prince."
45076,45077,King John,6.0,4.1.11,ARTHUR,"As little prince, having so great a title"
45077,45078,King John,6.0,4.1.12,ARTHUR,"To be more prince, as may be. You are sad."
45078,45079,King John,7.0,4.1.13,HUBERT,"Indeed, I have been merrier."
45079,45080,King John,8.0,4.1.14,ARTHUR,Mercy on me!
45080,45081,King John,8.0,4.1.15,ARTHUR,Methinks no body should be sad but I:
45081,45082,King John,8.0,4.1.16,ARTHUR,"Yet, I remember, when I was in France,"
45082,45083,King John,8.0,4.1.17,ARTHUR,"Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,"
45083,45084,King John,8.0,4.1.18,ARTHUR,"Only for wantonness. By my christendom,"
45084,45085,King John,8.0,4.1.19,ARTHUR,"So I were out of prison and kept sheep,"
45085,45086,King John,8.0,4.1.20,ARTHUR,"I should be as merry as the day is long,"
45086,45087,King John,8.0,4.1.21,ARTHUR,"And so I would be here, but that I doubt"
45087,45088,King John,8.0,4.1.22,ARTHUR,My uncle practises more harm to me:
45088,45089,King John,8.0,4.1.23,ARTHUR,He is afraid of me and I of him:
45089,45090,King John,8.0,4.1.24,ARTHUR,Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
45090,45091,King John,8.0,4.1.25,ARTHUR,"No, indeed, is't not, and I would to heaven"
45091,45092,King John,8.0,4.1.26,ARTHUR,"I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert."
45092,45093,King John,9.0,4.1.27,HUBERT,"[Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate"
45093,45094,King John,9.0,4.1.28,HUBERT,He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
45094,45095,King John,9.0,4.1.29,HUBERT,Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
45095,45096,King John,10.0,4.1.30,ARTHUR,"Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:"
45096,45097,King John,10.0,4.1.31,ARTHUR,"In sooth, I would you were a little sick,"
45097,45098,King John,10.0,4.1.32,ARTHUR,That I might sit all night and watch with you:
45098,45099,King John,10.0,4.1.33,ARTHUR,I warrant I love you more than you do me.
45099,45100,King John,11.0,4.1.34,HUBERT,[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.
45100,45101,King John,11.0,4.1.35,HUBERT,"Read here, young Arthur."
45101,45102,King John,11.0,,HUBERT,Showing a paper
45102,45103,King John,11.0,,HUBERT,Aside
45103,45104,King John,11.0,4.1.36,HUBERT,"How now, foolish rheum!"
45104,45105,King John,11.0,4.1.37,HUBERT,Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
45105,45106,King John,11.0,4.1.38,HUBERT,"I must be brief, lest resolution drop"
45106,45107,King John,11.0,4.1.39,HUBERT,Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
45107,45108,King John,11.0,4.1.40,HUBERT,Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
45108,45109,King John,12.0,4.1.41,ARTHUR,"Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:"
45109,45110,King John,12.0,4.1.42,ARTHUR,Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
45110,45111,King John,13.0,4.1.43,HUBERT,"Young boy, I must."
45111,45112,King John,14.0,4.1.44,ARTHUR,And will you?
45112,45113,King John,15.0,4.1.45,HUBERT,And I will.
45113,45114,King John,16.0,4.1.46,ARTHUR,"Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,"
45114,45115,King John,16.0,4.1.47,ARTHUR,"I knit my handercher about your brows,"
45115,45116,King John,16.0,4.1.48,ARTHUR,"The best I had, a princess wrought it me,"
45116,45117,King John,16.0,4.1.49,ARTHUR,"And I did never ask it you again,"
45117,45118,King John,16.0,4.1.50,ARTHUR,"And with my hand at midnight held your head,"
45118,45119,King John,16.0,4.1.51,ARTHUR,"And like the watchful minutes to the hour,"
45119,45120,King John,16.0,4.1.52,ARTHUR,"Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,"
45120,45121,King John,16.0,4.1.53,ARTHUR,"Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'"
45121,45122,King John,16.0,4.1.54,ARTHUR,Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
45122,45123,King John,16.0,4.1.55,ARTHUR,Many a poor man's son would have lien still
45123,45124,King John,16.0,4.1.56,ARTHUR,"And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you,"
45124,45125,King John,16.0,4.1.57,ARTHUR,But you at your sick service had a prince.
45125,45126,King John,16.0,4.1.58,ARTHUR,"Nay, you may think my love was crafty love"
45126,45127,King John,16.0,4.1.59,ARTHUR,"And call it cunning: do, an if you will:"
45127,45128,King John,16.0,4.1.60,ARTHUR,"If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,"
45128,45129,King John,16.0,4.1.61,ARTHUR,Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
45129,45130,King John,16.0,4.1.62,ARTHUR,These eyes that never did nor never shall
45130,45131,King John,16.0,4.1.63,ARTHUR,So much as frown on you.
45131,45132,King John,17.0,4.1.64,HUBERT,"I have sworn to do it,"
45132,45133,King John,17.0,4.1.65,HUBERT,And with hot irons must I burn them out.
45133,45134,King John,18.0,4.1.66,ARTHUR,"Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!"
45134,45135,King John,18.0,4.1.67,ARTHUR,"The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,"
45135,45136,King John,18.0,4.1.68,ARTHUR,"Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears"
45136,45137,King John,18.0,4.1.69,ARTHUR,And quench his fiery indignation
45137,45138,King John,18.0,4.1.70,ARTHUR,"Even in the matter of mine innocence,"
45138,45139,King John,18.0,4.1.71,ARTHUR,"Nay, after that, consume away in rust"
45139,45140,King John,18.0,4.1.72,ARTHUR,But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
45140,45141,King John,18.0,4.1.73,ARTHUR,Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
45141,45142,King John,18.0,4.1.74,ARTHUR,An if an angel should have come to me
45142,45143,King John,18.0,4.1.75,ARTHUR,"And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,"
45143,45144,King John,18.0,4.1.76,ARTHUR,"I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's."
45144,45145,King John,19.0,4.1.77,HUBERT,Come forth.
45145,45146,King John,19.0,,HUBERT,Stamps
45146,45147,King John,19.0,,HUBERT,"Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons,  and c"
45147,45148,King John,19.0,4.1.78,HUBERT,Do as I bid you do.
45148,45149,King John,20.0,4.1.79,ARTHUR,"O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out"
45149,45150,King John,20.0,4.1.80,ARTHUR,Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
45150,45151,King John,21.0,4.1.81,HUBERT,"Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here."
45151,45152,King John,22.0,4.1.82,ARTHUR,"Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?"
45152,45153,King John,22.0,4.1.83,ARTHUR,"I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still."
45153,45154,King John,22.0,4.1.84,ARTHUR,"For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!"
45154,45155,King John,22.0,4.1.85,ARTHUR,"Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,"
45155,45156,King John,22.0,4.1.86,ARTHUR,"And I will sit as quiet as a lamb,"
45156,45157,King John,22.0,4.1.87,ARTHUR,"I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,"
45157,45158,King John,22.0,4.1.88,ARTHUR,Nor look upon the iron angerly:
45158,45159,King John,22.0,4.1.89,ARTHUR,"Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,"
45159,45160,King John,22.0,4.1.90,ARTHUR,Whatever torment you do put me to.
45160,45161,King John,23.0,4.1.91,HUBERT,"Go, stand within, let me alone with him."
45161,45162,King John,24.0,4.1.92,First Executioner,I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
45162,45163,King John,24.0,,First Executioner,Exeunt Executioners
45163,45164,King John,25.0,4.1.93,ARTHUR,"Alas, I then have chid away my friend!"
45164,45165,King John,25.0,4.1.94,ARTHUR,"He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:"
45165,45166,King John,25.0,4.1.95,ARTHUR,"Let him come back, that his compassion may"
45166,45167,King John,25.0,4.1.96,ARTHUR,Give life to yours.
45167,45168,King John,26.0,4.1.97,HUBERT,"Come, boy, prepare yourself."
45168,45169,King John,27.0,4.1.98,ARTHUR,Is there no remedy?
45169,45170,King John,28.0,4.1.99,HUBERT,"None, but to lose your eyes."
45170,45171,King John,29.0,4.1.100,ARTHUR,"O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,"
45171,45172,King John,29.0,4.1.101,ARTHUR,"A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,"
45172,45173,King John,29.0,4.1.102,ARTHUR,Any annoyance in that precious sense!
45173,45174,King John,29.0,4.1.103,ARTHUR,"Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,"
45174,45175,King John,29.0,4.1.104,ARTHUR,Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
45175,45176,King John,30.0,4.1.105,HUBERT,"Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue."
45176,45177,King John,31.0,4.1.106,ARTHUR,"Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues"
45177,45178,King John,31.0,4.1.107,ARTHUR,Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:
45178,45179,King John,31.0,4.1.108,ARTHUR,"Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert,"
45179,45180,King John,31.0,4.1.109,ARTHUR,"Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,"
45180,45181,King John,31.0,4.1.110,ARTHUR,"So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes."
45181,45182,King John,31.0,4.1.111,ARTHUR,Though to no use but still to look on you!
45182,45183,King John,31.0,4.1.112,ARTHUR,"Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold"
45183,45184,King John,31.0,4.1.113,ARTHUR,And would not harm me.
45184,45185,King John,32.0,4.1.114,HUBERT,"I can heat it, boy."
45185,45186,King John,33.0,4.1.115,ARTHUR,"No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,"
45186,45187,King John,33.0,4.1.116,ARTHUR,"Being create for comfort, to be used"
45187,45188,King John,33.0,4.1.117,ARTHUR,"In undeserved extremes: see else yourself,"
45188,45189,King John,33.0,4.1.118,ARTHUR,"There is no malice in this burning coal,"
45189,45190,King John,33.0,4.1.119,ARTHUR,The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
45190,45191,King John,33.0,4.1.120,ARTHUR,And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.
45191,45192,King John,34.0,4.1.121,HUBERT,"But with my breath I can revive it, boy."
45192,45193,King John,35.0,4.1.122,ARTHUR,"An if you do, you will but make it blush"
45193,45194,King John,35.0,4.1.123,ARTHUR,"And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:"
45194,45195,King John,35.0,4.1.124,ARTHUR,"Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,"
45195,45196,King John,35.0,4.1.125,ARTHUR,"And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,"
45196,45197,King John,35.0,4.1.126,ARTHUR,Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
45197,45198,King John,35.0,4.1.127,ARTHUR,All things that you should use to do me wrong
45198,45199,King John,35.0,4.1.128,ARTHUR,Deny their office: only you do lack
45199,45200,King John,35.0,4.1.129,ARTHUR,"That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,"
45200,45201,King John,35.0,4.1.130,ARTHUR,Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
45201,45202,King John,36.0,4.1.131,HUBERT,"Well, see to live, I will not touch thine eye"
45202,45203,King John,36.0,4.1.132,HUBERT,For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
45203,45204,King John,36.0,4.1.133,HUBERT,"Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,"
45204,45205,King John,36.0,4.1.134,HUBERT,With this same very iron to burn them out.
45205,45206,King John,37.0,4.1.135,ARTHUR,"O, now you look like Hubert! all this while"
45206,45207,King John,37.0,4.1.136,ARTHUR,You were disguised.
45207,45208,King John,38.0,4.1.137,HUBERT,"Peace, no more. Adieu."
45208,45209,King John,38.0,4.1.138,HUBERT,"Your uncle must not know but you are dead,"
45209,45210,King John,38.0,4.1.139,HUBERT,I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
45210,45211,King John,38.0,4.1.140,HUBERT,"And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,"
45211,45212,King John,38.0,4.1.141,HUBERT,"That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,"
45212,45213,King John,38.0,4.1.142,HUBERT,Will not offend thee.
45213,45214,King John,39.0,4.1.143,ARTHUR,"O heaven! I thank you, Hubert."
45214,45215,King John,40.0,4.1.144,HUBERT,"Silence, no more: go closely in with me:"
45215,45216,King John,40.0,4.1.145,HUBERT,Much danger do I undergo for thee.
45216,45217,King John,40.0,,HUBERT,Exeunt
45217,45218,King John,40.0,,HUBERT,SCENE II. KING JOHN'S palace.
45218,45219,King John,40.0,,HUBERT,"Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords"
45219,45220,King John,1.0,4.2.1,KING JOHN,"Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,"
45220,45221,King John,1.0,4.2.2,KING JOHN,"And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes."
45221,45222,King John,2.0,4.2.3,PEMBROKE,"This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,"
45222,45223,King John,2.0,4.2.4,PEMBROKE,"Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,"
45223,45224,King John,2.0,4.2.5,PEMBROKE,"And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,"
45224,45225,King John,2.0,4.2.6,PEMBROKE,"The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt,"
45225,45226,King John,2.0,4.2.7,PEMBROKE,Fresh expectation troubled not the land
45226,45227,King John,2.0,4.2.8,PEMBROKE,With any long'd-for change or better state.
45227,45228,King John,3.0,4.2.9,SALISBURY,"Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,"
45228,45229,King John,3.0,4.2.10,SALISBURY,"To guard a title that was rich before,"
45229,45230,King John,3.0,4.2.11,SALISBURY,"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,"
45230,45231,King John,3.0,4.2.12,SALISBURY,"To throw a perfume on the violet,"
45231,45232,King John,3.0,4.2.13,SALISBURY,"To smooth the ice, or add another hue"
45232,45233,King John,3.0,4.2.14,SALISBURY,"Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light"
45233,45234,King John,3.0,4.2.15,SALISBURY,"To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,"
45234,45235,King John,3.0,4.2.16,SALISBURY,Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
45235,45236,King John,4.0,4.2.17,PEMBROKE,"But that your royal pleasure must be done,"
45236,45237,King John,4.0,4.2.18,PEMBROKE,"This act is as an ancient tale new told,"
45237,45238,King John,4.0,4.2.19,PEMBROKE,"And in the last repeating troublesome,"
45238,45239,King John,4.0,4.2.20,PEMBROKE,Being urged at a time unseasonable.
45239,45240,King John,5.0,4.2.21,SALISBURY,In this the antique and well noted face
45240,45241,King John,5.0,4.2.22,SALISBURY,"Of plain old form is much disfigured,"
45241,45242,King John,5.0,4.2.23,SALISBURY,"And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,"
45242,45243,King John,5.0,4.2.24,SALISBURY,"It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,"
45243,45244,King John,5.0,4.2.25,SALISBURY,"Startles and frights consideration,"
45244,45245,King John,5.0,4.2.26,SALISBURY,"Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,"
45245,45246,King John,5.0,4.2.27,SALISBURY,For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
45246,45247,King John,6.0,4.2.28,PEMBROKE,"When workmen strive to do better than well,"
45247,45248,King John,6.0,4.2.29,PEMBROKE,"They do confound their skill in covetousness,"
45248,45249,King John,6.0,4.2.30,PEMBROKE,And oftentimes excusing of a fault
45249,45250,King John,6.0,4.2.31,PEMBROKE,"Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,"
45250,45251,King John,6.0,4.2.32,PEMBROKE,As patches set upon a little breach
45251,45252,King John,6.0,4.2.33,PEMBROKE,Discredit more in hiding of the fault
45252,45253,King John,6.0,4.2.34,PEMBROKE,Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
45253,45254,King John,7.0,4.2.35,SALISBURY,"To this effect, before you were new crown'd,"
45254,45255,King John,7.0,4.2.36,SALISBURY,We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
45255,45256,King John,7.0,4.2.37,SALISBURY,"To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,"
45256,45257,King John,7.0,4.2.38,SALISBURY,Since all and every part of what we would
45257,45258,King John,7.0,4.2.39,SALISBURY,Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
45258,45259,King John,8.0,4.2.40,KING JOHN,Some reasons of this double coronation
45259,45260,King John,8.0,4.2.41,KING JOHN,"I have possess'd you with and think them strong,"
45260,45261,King John,8.0,4.2.42,KING JOHN,"And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,"
45261,45262,King John,8.0,4.2.43,KING JOHN,I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
45262,45263,King John,8.0,4.2.44,KING JOHN,"What you would have reform'd that is not well,"
45263,45264,King John,8.0,4.2.45,KING JOHN,And well shall you perceive how willingly
45264,45265,King John,8.0,4.2.46,KING JOHN,I will both hear and grant you your requests.
45265,45266,King John,9.0,4.2.47,PEMBROKE,"Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,"
45266,45267,King John,9.0,4.2.48,PEMBROKE,"To sound the purpose of all their hearts,"
45267,45268,King John,9.0,4.2.49,PEMBROKE,"Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,"
45268,45269,King John,9.0,4.2.50,PEMBROKE,"Your safety, for the which myself and them"
45269,45270,King John,9.0,4.2.51,PEMBROKE,"Bend their best studies, heartily request"
45270,45271,King John,9.0,4.2.52,PEMBROKE,"The enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint"
45271,45272,King John,9.0,4.2.53,PEMBROKE,Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
45272,45273,King John,9.0,4.2.54,PEMBROKE,"To break into this dangerous argument,--"
45273,45274,King John,9.0,4.2.55,PEMBROKE,"If what in rest you have in right you hold,"
45274,45275,King John,9.0,4.2.56,PEMBROKE,"Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend"
45275,45276,King John,9.0,4.2.57,PEMBROKE,"The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up"
45276,45277,King John,9.0,4.2.58,PEMBROKE,Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
45277,45278,King John,9.0,4.2.59,PEMBROKE,With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
45278,45279,King John,9.0,4.2.60,PEMBROKE,The rich advantage of good exercise?
45279,45280,King John,9.0,4.2.61,PEMBROKE,That the time's enemies may not have this
45280,45281,King John,9.0,4.2.62,PEMBROKE,"To grace occasions, let it be our suit"
45281,45282,King John,9.0,4.2.63,PEMBROKE,"That you have bid us ask his liberty,"
45282,45283,King John,9.0,4.2.64,PEMBROKE,Which for our goods we do no further ask
45283,45284,King John,9.0,4.2.65,PEMBROKE,"Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,"
45284,45285,King John,9.0,4.2.66,PEMBROKE,Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
45285,45286,King John,9.0,,PEMBROKE,Enter HUBERT
45286,45287,King John,10.0,4.2.67,KING JOHN,Let it be so: I do commit his youth
45287,45288,King John,10.0,4.2.68,KING JOHN,"To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?"
45288,45289,King John,10.0,,KING JOHN,Taking him apart
45289,45290,King John,11.0,4.2.69,PEMBROKE,"This is the man should do the bloody deed,"
45290,45291,King John,11.0,4.2.70,PEMBROKE,He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
45291,45292,King John,11.0,4.2.71,PEMBROKE,The image of a wicked heinous fault
45292,45293,King John,11.0,4.2.72,PEMBROKE,"Lives in his eye, that close aspect of his"
45293,45294,King John,11.0,4.2.73,PEMBROKE,"Does show the mood of a much troubled breast,"
45294,45295,King John,11.0,4.2.74,PEMBROKE,"And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,"
45295,45296,King John,11.0,4.2.75,PEMBROKE,What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
45296,45297,King John,12.0,4.2.76,SALISBURY,The colour of the king doth come and go
45297,45298,King John,12.0,4.2.77,SALISBURY,"Between his purpose and his conscience,"
45298,45299,King John,12.0,4.2.78,SALISBURY,Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
45299,45300,King John,12.0,4.2.79,SALISBURY,"His passion is so ripe, it needs must break."
45300,45301,King John,13.0,4.2.80,PEMBROKE,"And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence"
45301,45302,King John,13.0,4.2.81,PEMBROKE,The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
45302,45303,King John,14.0,4.2.82,KING JOHN,We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
45303,45304,King John,14.0,4.2.83,KING JOHN,"Good lords, although my will to give is living,"
45304,45305,King John,14.0,4.2.84,KING JOHN,The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
45305,45306,King John,14.0,4.2.85,KING JOHN,He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.
45306,45307,King John,15.0,4.2.86,SALISBURY,Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
45307,45308,King John,16.0,4.2.87,PEMBROKE,Indeed we heard how near his death he was
45308,45309,King John,16.0,4.2.88,PEMBROKE,Before the child himself felt he was sick:
45309,45310,King John,16.0,4.2.89,PEMBROKE,This must be answer'd either here or hence.
45310,45311,King John,17.0,4.2.90,KING JOHN,Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
45311,45312,King John,17.0,4.2.91,KING JOHN,Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
45312,45313,King John,17.0,4.2.92,KING JOHN,Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
45313,45314,King John,18.0,4.2.93,SALISBURY,"It is apparent foul play, and 'tis shame"
45314,45315,King John,18.0,4.2.94,SALISBURY,That greatness should so grossly offer it:
45315,45316,King John,18.0,4.2.95,SALISBURY,"So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell."
45316,45317,King John,19.0,4.2.96,PEMBROKE,"Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee,"
45317,45318,King John,19.0,4.2.97,PEMBROKE,"And find the inheritance of this poor child,"
45318,45319,King John,19.0,4.2.98,PEMBROKE,His little kingdom of a forced grave.
45319,45320,King John,19.0,4.2.99,PEMBROKE,"That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,"
45320,45321,King John,19.0,4.2.100,PEMBROKE,Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
45321,45322,King John,19.0,4.2.101,PEMBROKE,This must not be thus borne: this will break out
45322,45323,King John,19.0,4.2.102,PEMBROKE,"To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt."
45323,45324,King John,19.0,,PEMBROKE,Exeunt Lords
45324,45325,King John,20.0,4.2.103,KING JOHN,They burn in indignation. I repent:
45325,45326,King John,20.0,4.2.104,KING JOHN,"There is no sure foundation set on blood,"
45326,45327,King John,20.0,4.2.105,KING JOHN,No certain life achieved by others' death.
45327,45328,King John,20.0,,KING JOHN,Enter a Messenger
45328,45329,King John,20.0,4.2.106,KING JOHN,A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
45329,45330,King John,20.0,4.2.107,KING JOHN,That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
45330,45331,King John,20.0,4.2.108,KING JOHN,So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
45331,45332,King John,20.0,4.2.109,KING JOHN,Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
45332,45333,King John,21.0,4.2.110,Messenger,From France to England. Never such a power
45333,45334,King John,21.0,4.2.111,Messenger,For any foreign preparation
45334,45335,King John,21.0,4.2.112,Messenger,Was levied in the body of a land.
45335,45336,King John,21.0,4.2.113,Messenger,"The copy of your speed is learn'd by them,"
45336,45337,King John,21.0,4.2.114,Messenger,"For when you should be told they do prepare,"
45337,45338,King John,21.0,4.2.115,Messenger,The tidings come that they are all arrived.
45338,45339,King John,22.0,4.2.116,KING JOHN,"O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?"
45339,45340,King John,22.0,4.2.117,KING JOHN,"Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,"
45340,45341,King John,22.0,4.2.118,KING JOHN,"That such an army could be drawn in France,"
45341,45342,King John,22.0,4.2.119,KING JOHN,And she not hear of it?
45342,45343,King John,23.0,4.2.120,Messenger,"My liege, her ear"
45343,45344,King John,23.0,4.2.121,Messenger,"Is stopp'd with dust, the first of April died"
45344,45345,King John,23.0,4.2.122,Messenger,"Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,"
45345,45346,King John,23.0,4.2.123,Messenger,The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
45346,45347,King John,23.0,4.2.124,Messenger,Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
45347,45348,King John,23.0,4.2.125,Messenger,"I idly heard, if true or false I know not."
45348,45349,King John,24.0,4.2.126,KING JOHN,"Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!"
45349,45350,King John,24.0,4.2.127,KING JOHN,"O, make a league with me, till I have pleased"
45350,45351,King John,24.0,4.2.128,KING JOHN,My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
45351,45352,King John,24.0,4.2.129,KING JOHN,How wildly then walks my estate in France!
45352,45353,King John,24.0,4.2.130,KING JOHN,Under whose conduct came those powers of France
45353,45354,King John,24.0,4.2.131,KING JOHN,That thou for truth givest out are landed here?
45354,45355,King John,25.0,4.2.132,Messenger,Under the Dauphin.
45355,45356,King John,26.0,4.2.133,KING JOHN,Thou hast made me giddy
45356,45357,King John,26.0,4.2.134,KING JOHN,With these ill tidings.
45357,45358,King John,26.0,,KING JOHN,Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret
45358,45359,King John,26.0,4.2.135,KING JOHN,"Now, what says the world"
45359,45360,King John,26.0,4.2.136,KING JOHN,To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
45360,45361,King John,26.0,4.2.137,KING JOHN,"My head with more ill news, for it is full."
45361,45362,King John,27.0,4.2.138,BASTARD,"But if you be afeard to hear the worst,"
45362,45363,King John,27.0,4.2.139,BASTARD,Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.
45363,45364,King John,28.0,4.2.140,KING JOHN,"Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed"
45364,45365,King John,28.0,4.2.141,KING JOHN,Under the tide: but now I breathe again
45365,45366,King John,28.0,4.2.142,KING JOHN,"Aloft the flood, and can give audience"
45366,45367,King John,28.0,4.2.143,KING JOHN,"To any tongue, speak it of what it will."
45367,45368,King John,29.0,4.2.144,BASTARD,"How I have sped among the clergymen,"
45368,45369,King John,29.0,4.2.145,BASTARD,The sums I have collected shall express.
45369,45370,King John,29.0,4.2.146,BASTARD,"But as I travell'd hither through the land,"
45370,45371,King John,29.0,4.2.147,BASTARD,"I find the people strangely fantasied,"
45371,45372,King John,29.0,4.2.148,BASTARD,"Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,"
45372,45373,King John,29.0,4.2.149,BASTARD,"Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:"
45373,45374,King John,29.0,4.2.150,BASTARD,"And here a prophet, that I brought with me"
45374,45375,King John,29.0,4.2.151,BASTARD,"From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found"
45375,45376,King John,29.0,4.2.152,BASTARD,"With many hundreds treading on his heels,"
45376,45377,King John,29.0,4.2.153,BASTARD,"To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,"
45377,45378,King John,29.0,4.2.154,BASTARD,"That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,"
45378,45379,King John,29.0,4.2.155,BASTARD,Your highness should deliver up your crown.
45379,45380,King John,30.0,4.2.156,KING JOHN,"Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?"
45380,45381,King John,31.0,4.2.157,PETER,Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
45381,45382,King John,32.0,4.2.158,KING JOHN,"Hubert, away with him, imprison him,"
45382,45383,King John,32.0,4.2.159,KING JOHN,And on that day at noon whereon he says
45383,45384,King John,32.0,4.2.160,KING JOHN,"I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd."
45384,45385,King John,32.0,4.2.161,KING JOHN,"Deliver him to safety, and return,"
45385,45386,King John,32.0,4.2.162,KING JOHN,For I must use thee.
45386,45387,King John,32.0,,KING JOHN,Exeunt HUBERT with PETER
45387,45388,King John,32.0,4.2.163,KING JOHN,"O my gentle cousin,"
45388,45389,King John,32.0,4.2.164,KING JOHN,"Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?"
45389,45390,King John,33.0,4.2.165,BASTARD,"The French, my lord, men's mouths are full of it:"
45390,45391,King John,33.0,4.2.166,BASTARD,"Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,"
45391,45392,King John,33.0,4.2.167,BASTARD,"With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,"
45392,45393,King John,33.0,4.2.168,BASTARD,"And others more, going to seek the grave"
45393,45394,King John,33.0,4.2.169,BASTARD,"Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night"
45394,45395,King John,33.0,4.2.170,BASTARD,On your suggestion.
45395,45396,King John,34.0,4.2.171,KING JOHN,"Gentle kinsman, go,"
45396,45397,King John,34.0,4.2.172,KING JOHN,And thrust thyself into their companies:
45397,45398,King John,34.0,4.2.173,KING JOHN,"I have a way to win their loves again,"
45398,45399,King John,34.0,4.2.174,KING JOHN,Bring them before me.
45399,45400,King John,35.0,4.2.175,BASTARD,I will seek them out.
45400,45401,King John,36.0,4.2.176,KING JOHN,"Nay, but make haste, the better foot before."
45401,45402,King John,36.0,4.2.177,KING JOHN,"O, let me have no subject enemies,"
45402,45403,King John,36.0,4.2.178,KING JOHN,When adverse foreigners affright my towns
45403,45404,King John,36.0,4.2.179,KING JOHN,With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
45404,45405,King John,36.0,4.2.180,KING JOHN,"Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,"
45405,45406,King John,36.0,4.2.181,KING JOHN,And fly like thought from them to me again.
45406,45407,King John,37.0,4.2.182,BASTARD,The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
45407,45408,King John,37.0,,BASTARD,Exit
45408,45409,King John,38.0,4.2.183,KING JOHN,Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
45409,45410,King John,38.0,4.2.184,KING JOHN,"Go after him, for he perhaps shall need"
45410,45411,King John,38.0,4.2.185,KING JOHN,"Some messenger betwixt me and the peers,"
45411,45412,King John,38.0,4.2.186,KING JOHN,And be thou he.
45412,45413,King John,39.0,4.2.187,Messenger,"With all my heart, my liege."
45413,45414,King John,39.0,,Messenger,Exit
45414,45415,King John,40.0,4.2.188,KING JOHN,My mother dead!
45415,45416,King John,40.0,,KING JOHN,Re-enter HUBERT
45416,45417,King John,41.0,4.2.189,HUBERT,"My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night,"
45417,45418,King John,41.0,4.2.190,HUBERT,"Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about"
45418,45419,King John,41.0,4.2.191,HUBERT,The other four in wondrous motion.
45419,45420,King John,42.0,4.2.192,KING JOHN,Five moons!
45420,45421,King John,43.0,4.2.193,HUBERT,Old men and beldams in the streets
45421,45422,King John,43.0,4.2.194,HUBERT,Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
45422,45423,King John,43.0,4.2.195,HUBERT,Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
45423,45424,King John,43.0,4.2.196,HUBERT,"And when they talk of him, they shake their heads"
45424,45425,King John,43.0,4.2.197,HUBERT,"And whisper one another in the ear,"
45425,45426,King John,43.0,4.2.198,HUBERT,"And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,"
45426,45427,King John,43.0,4.2.199,HUBERT,"Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,"
45427,45428,King John,43.0,4.2.200,HUBERT,"With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes."
45428,45429,King John,43.0,4.2.201,HUBERT,"I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,"
45429,45430,King John,43.0,4.2.202,HUBERT,"The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,"
45430,45431,King John,43.0,4.2.203,HUBERT,"With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news,"
45431,45432,King John,43.0,4.2.204,HUBERT,"Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,"
45432,45433,King John,43.0,4.2.205,HUBERT,"Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste"
45433,45434,King John,43.0,4.2.206,HUBERT,"Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,"
45434,45435,King John,43.0,4.2.207,HUBERT,Told of a many thousand warlike French
45435,45436,King John,43.0,4.2.208,HUBERT,That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
45436,45437,King John,43.0,4.2.209,HUBERT,Another lean unwash'd artificer
45437,45438,King John,43.0,4.2.210,HUBERT,Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
45438,45439,King John,44.0,4.2.211,KING JOHN,Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
45439,45440,King John,44.0,4.2.212,KING JOHN,Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
45440,45441,King John,44.0,4.2.213,KING JOHN,Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
45441,45442,King John,44.0,4.2.214,KING JOHN,"To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him."
45442,45443,King John,45.0,4.2.215,HUBERT,"No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?"
45443,45444,King John,46.0,4.2.216,KING JOHN,It is the curse of kings to be attended
45444,45445,King John,46.0,4.2.217,KING JOHN,By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
45445,45446,King John,46.0,4.2.218,KING JOHN,"To break within the bloody house of life,"
45446,45447,King John,46.0,4.2.219,KING JOHN,And on the winking of authority
45447,45448,King John,46.0,4.2.220,KING JOHN,"To understand a law, to know the meaning"
45448,45449,King John,46.0,4.2.221,KING JOHN,"Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns"
45449,45450,King John,46.0,4.2.222,KING JOHN,More upon humour than advised respect.
45450,45451,King John,47.0,4.2.223,HUBERT,Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
45451,45452,King John,48.0,4.2.224,KING JOHN,"O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth"
45452,45453,King John,48.0,4.2.225,KING JOHN,"Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal"
45453,45454,King John,48.0,4.2.226,KING JOHN,Witness against us to damnation!
45454,45455,King John,48.0,4.2.227,KING JOHN,How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
45455,45456,King John,48.0,4.2.228,KING JOHN,"Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,"
45456,45457,King John,48.0,4.2.229,KING JOHN,"A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,"
45457,45458,King John,48.0,4.2.230,KING JOHN,"Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,"
45458,45459,King John,48.0,4.2.231,KING JOHN,This murder had not come into my mind:
45459,45460,King John,48.0,4.2.232,KING JOHN,"But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,"
45460,45461,King John,48.0,4.2.233,KING JOHN,"Finding thee fit for bloody villany,"
45461,45462,King John,48.0,4.2.234,KING JOHN,"Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,"
45462,45463,King John,48.0,4.2.235,KING JOHN,"I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death,"
45463,45464,King John,48.0,4.2.236,KING JOHN,"And thou, to be endeared to a king,"
45464,45465,King John,48.0,4.2.237,KING JOHN,Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
45465,45466,King John,49.0,4.2.238,HUBERT,My lord--
45466,45467,King John,50.0,4.2.239,KING JOHN,Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
45467,45468,King John,50.0,4.2.240,KING JOHN,"When I spake darkly what I purposed,"
45468,45469,King John,50.0,4.2.241,KING JOHN,"Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,"
45469,45470,King John,50.0,4.2.242,KING JOHN,"As bid me tell my tale in express words,"
45470,45471,King John,50.0,4.2.243,KING JOHN,"Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,"
45471,45472,King John,50.0,4.2.244,KING JOHN,And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
45472,45473,King John,50.0,4.2.245,KING JOHN,But thou didst understand me by my signs
45473,45474,King John,50.0,4.2.246,KING JOHN,"And didst in signs again parley with sin,"
45474,45475,King John,50.0,4.2.247,KING JOHN,"Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,"
45475,45476,King John,50.0,4.2.248,KING JOHN,And consequently thy rude hand to act
45476,45477,King John,50.0,4.2.249,KING JOHN,"The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name."
45477,45478,King John,50.0,4.2.250,KING JOHN,"Out of my sight, and never see me more!"
45478,45479,King John,50.0,4.2.251,KING JOHN,"My nobles leave me, and my state is braved,"
45479,45480,King John,50.0,4.2.252,KING JOHN,"Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:"
45480,45481,King John,50.0,4.2.253,KING JOHN,"Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,"
45481,45482,King John,50.0,4.2.254,KING JOHN,"This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,"
45482,45483,King John,50.0,4.2.255,KING JOHN,Hostility and civil tumult reigns
45483,45484,King John,50.0,4.2.256,KING JOHN,Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
45484,45485,King John,51.0,4.2.257,HUBERT,"Arm you against your other enemies,"
45485,45486,King John,51.0,4.2.258,HUBERT,I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
45486,45487,King John,51.0,4.2.259,HUBERT,Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
45487,45488,King John,51.0,4.2.260,HUBERT,"Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,"
45488,45489,King John,51.0,4.2.261,HUBERT,Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
45489,45490,King John,51.0,4.2.262,HUBERT,Within this bosom never enter'd yet
45490,45491,King John,51.0,4.2.263,HUBERT,"The dreadful motion of a murderous thought,"
45491,45492,King John,51.0,4.2.264,HUBERT,"And you have slander'd nature in my form,"
45492,45493,King John,51.0,4.2.265,HUBERT,"Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,"
45493,45494,King John,51.0,4.2.266,HUBERT,Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
45494,45495,King John,51.0,4.2.267,HUBERT,Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
45495,45496,King John,52.0,4.2.268,KING JOHN,"Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,"
45496,45497,King John,52.0,4.2.269,KING JOHN,"Throw this report on their incensed rage,"
45497,45498,King John,52.0,4.2.270,KING JOHN,And make them tame to their obedience!
45498,45499,King John,52.0,4.2.271,KING JOHN,Forgive the comment that my passion made
45499,45500,King John,52.0,4.2.272,KING JOHN,"Upon thy feature, for my rage was blind,"
45500,45501,King John,52.0,4.2.273,KING JOHN,And foul imaginary eyes of blood
45501,45502,King John,52.0,4.2.274,KING JOHN,Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
45502,45503,King John,52.0,4.2.275,KING JOHN,"O, answer not, but to my closet bring"
45503,45504,King John,52.0,4.2.276,KING JOHN,The angry lords with all expedient haste.
45504,45505,King John,52.0,4.2.277,KING JOHN,"I conjure thee but slowly, run more fast."
45505,45506,King John,52.0,,KING JOHN,Exeunt
45506,45507,King John,52.0,,KING JOHN,SCENE III. Before the castle.
45507,45508,King John,52.0,,KING JOHN,"Enter ARTHUR, on the walls"
45508,45509,King John,1.0,4.3.1,ARTHUR,"The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:"
45509,45510,King John,1.0,4.3.2,ARTHUR,"Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!"
45510,45511,King John,1.0,4.3.3,ARTHUR,"There's few or none do know me: if they did,"
45511,45512,King John,1.0,4.3.4,ARTHUR,This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
45512,45513,King John,1.0,4.3.5,ARTHUR,"I am afraid, and yet I'll venture it."
45513,45514,King John,1.0,4.3.6,ARTHUR,"If I get down, and do not break my limbs,"
45514,45515,King John,1.0,4.3.7,ARTHUR,I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
45515,45516,King John,1.0,4.3.8,ARTHUR,"As good to die and go, as die and stay."
45516,45517,King John,1.0,,ARTHUR,Leaps down
45517,45518,King John,1.0,4.3.9,ARTHUR,O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
45518,45519,King John,1.0,4.3.10,ARTHUR,"Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!"
45519,45520,King John,1.0,,ARTHUR,Dies
45520,45521,King John,1.0,,ARTHUR,"Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT"
45521,45522,King John,2.0,4.3.11,SALISBURY,"Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:"
45522,45523,King John,2.0,4.3.12,SALISBURY,"It is our safety, and we must embrace"
45523,45524,King John,2.0,4.3.13,SALISBURY,This gentle offer of the perilous time.
45524,45525,King John,3.0,4.3.14,PEMBROKE,Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
45525,45526,King John,4.0,4.3.15,SALISBURY,"The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,"
45526,45527,King John,4.0,4.3.16,SALISBURY,Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
45527,45528,King John,4.0,4.3.17,SALISBURY,Is much more general than these lines import.
45528,45529,King John,5.0,4.3.18,BIGOT,To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
45529,45530,King John,6.0,4.3.19,SALISBURY,"Or rather then set forward, for 'twill be"
45530,45531,King John,6.0,4.3.20,SALISBURY,"Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet."
45531,45532,King John,6.0,,SALISBURY,Enter the BASTARD
45532,45533,King John,7.0,4.3.21,BASTARD,"Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!"
45533,45534,King John,7.0,4.3.22,BASTARD,The king by me requests your presence straight.
45534,45535,King John,8.0,4.3.23,SALISBURY,The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
45535,45536,King John,8.0,4.3.24,SALISBURY,We will not line his thin bestained cloak
45536,45537,King John,8.0,4.3.25,SALISBURY,"With our pure honours, nor attend the foot"
45537,45538,King John,8.0,4.3.26,SALISBURY,That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
45538,45539,King John,8.0,4.3.27,SALISBURY,Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
45539,45540,King John,9.0,4.3.28,BASTARD,"Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best."
45540,45541,King John,10.0,4.3.29,SALISBURY,"Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now."
45541,45542,King John,11.0,4.3.30,BASTARD,"But there is little reason in your grief,"
45542,45543,King John,11.0,4.3.31,BASTARD,Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
45543,45544,King John,12.0,4.3.32,PEMBROKE,"Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege."
45544,45545,King John,13.0,4.3.33,BASTARD,"'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else."
45545,45546,King John,14.0,4.3.34,SALISBURY,This is the prison. What is he lies here?
45546,45547,King John,14.0,,SALISBURY,Seeing ARTHUR
45547,45548,King John,15.0,4.3.35,PEMBROKE,"O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!"
45548,45549,King John,15.0,4.3.36,PEMBROKE,The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
45549,45550,King John,16.0,4.3.37,SALISBURY,"Murder, as hating what himself hath done,"
45550,45551,King John,16.0,4.3.38,SALISBURY,Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
45551,45552,King John,17.0,4.3.39,BIGOT,"Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,"
45552,45553,King John,17.0,4.3.40,BIGOT,Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
45553,45554,King John,18.0,4.3.41,SALISBURY,"Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,"
45554,45555,King John,18.0,4.3.42,SALISBURY,Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
45555,45556,King John,18.0,4.3.43,SALISBURY,"Or do you almost think, although you see,"
45556,45557,King John,18.0,4.3.44,SALISBURY,"That you do see? could thought, without this object,"
45557,45558,King John,18.0,4.3.45,SALISBURY,"Form such another? This is the very top,"
45558,45559,King John,18.0,4.3.46,SALISBURY,"The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,"
45559,45560,King John,18.0,4.3.47,SALISBURY,"Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,"
45560,45561,King John,18.0,4.3.48,SALISBURY,"The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,"
45561,45562,King John,18.0,4.3.49,SALISBURY,That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
45562,45563,King John,18.0,4.3.50,SALISBURY,Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
45563,45564,King John,19.0,4.3.51,PEMBROKE,All murders past do stand excused in this:
45564,45565,King John,19.0,4.3.52,PEMBROKE,"And this, so sole and so unmatchable,"
45565,45566,King John,19.0,4.3.53,PEMBROKE,"Shall give a holiness, a purity,"
45566,45567,King John,19.0,4.3.54,PEMBROKE,"To the yet unbegotten sin of times,"
45567,45568,King John,19.0,4.3.55,PEMBROKE,"And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,"
45568,45569,King John,19.0,4.3.56,PEMBROKE,Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
45569,45570,King John,20.0,4.3.57,BASTARD,"It is a damned and a bloody work,"
45570,45571,King John,20.0,4.3.58,BASTARD,"The graceless action of a heavy hand,"
45571,45572,King John,20.0,4.3.59,BASTARD,If that it be the work of any hand.
45572,45573,King John,21.0,4.3.60,SALISBURY,If that it be the work of any hand!
45573,45574,King John,21.0,4.3.61,SALISBURY,We had a kind of light what would ensue:
45574,45575,King John,21.0,4.3.62,SALISBURY,"It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand,"
45575,45576,King John,21.0,4.3.63,SALISBURY,The practise and the purpose of the king:
45576,45577,King John,21.0,4.3.64,SALISBURY,"From whose obedience I forbid my soul,"
45577,45578,King John,21.0,4.3.65,SALISBURY,"Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,"
45578,45579,King John,21.0,4.3.66,SALISBURY,And breathing to his breathless excellence
45579,45580,King John,21.0,4.3.67,SALISBURY,"The incense of a vow, a holy vow,"
45580,45581,King John,21.0,4.3.68,SALISBURY,"Never to taste the pleasures of the world,"
45581,45582,King John,21.0,4.3.69,SALISBURY,"Never to be infected with delight,"
45582,45583,King John,21.0,4.3.70,SALISBURY,"Nor conversant with ease and idleness,"
45583,45584,King John,21.0,4.3.71,SALISBURY,"Till I have set a glory to this hand,"
45584,45585,King John,21.0,4.3.72,SALISBURY,By giving it the worship of revenge.
45585,45586,King John,23.0,4.3.73,BIGOT,Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
45586,45587,King John,23.0,,BIGOT,Enter HUBERT
45587,45588,King John,24.0,4.3.74,HUBERT,"Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:"
45588,45589,King John,24.0,4.3.75,HUBERT,"Arthur doth live, the king hath sent for you."
45589,45590,King John,25.0,4.3.76,SALISBURY,"O, he is old and blushes not at death."
45590,45591,King John,25.0,4.3.77,SALISBURY,"Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!"
45591,45592,King John,26.0,4.3.78,HUBERT,I am no villain.
45592,45593,King John,27.0,4.3.79,SALISBURY,Must I rob the law?
45593,45594,King John,27.0,,SALISBURY,Drawing his sword
45594,45595,King John,28.0,4.3.80,BASTARD,"Your sword is bright, sir, put it up again."
45595,45596,King John,29.0,4.3.81,SALISBURY,Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
45596,45597,King John,30.0,4.3.82,HUBERT,"Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say,"
45597,45598,King John,30.0,4.3.83,HUBERT,"By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:"
45598,45599,King John,30.0,4.3.84,HUBERT,"I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,"
45599,45600,King John,30.0,4.3.85,HUBERT,"Nor tempt the danger of my true defence,"
45600,45601,King John,30.0,4.3.86,HUBERT,"Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget"
45601,45602,King John,30.0,4.3.87,HUBERT,"Your worth, your greatness and nobility."
45602,45603,King John,31.0,4.3.88,BIGOT,"Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?"
45603,45604,King John,32.0,4.3.89,HUBERT,Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
45604,45605,King John,32.0,4.3.90,HUBERT,My innocent life against an emperor.
45605,45606,King John,33.0,4.3.91,SALISBURY,Thou art a murderer.
45606,45607,King John,34.0,4.3.92,HUBERT,"Do not prove me so,"
45607,45608,King John,34.0,4.3.93,HUBERT,"Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,"
45608,45609,King John,34.0,4.3.94,HUBERT,"Not truly speaks, who speaks not truly, lies."
45609,45610,King John,35.0,4.3.95,PEMBROKE,Cut him to pieces.
45610,45611,King John,36.0,4.3.96,BASTARD,"Keep the peace, I say."
45611,45612,King John,37.0,4.3.97,SALISBURY,"Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge."
45612,45613,King John,38.0,4.3.98,BASTARD,"Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:"
45613,45614,King John,38.0,4.3.99,BASTARD,"If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,"
45614,45615,King John,38.0,4.3.100,BASTARD,"Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,"
45615,45616,King John,38.0,4.3.101,BASTARD,"I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime,"
45616,45617,King John,38.0,4.3.102,BASTARD,"Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,"
45617,45618,King John,38.0,4.3.103,BASTARD,That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
45618,45619,King John,39.0,4.3.104,BIGOT,"What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?"
45619,45620,King John,39.0,4.3.105,BIGOT,Second a villain and a murderer?
45620,45621,King John,40.0,4.3.106,HUBERT,"Lord Bigot, I am none."
45621,45622,King John,41.0,4.3.107,BIGOT,Who kill'd this prince?
45622,45623,King John,42.0,4.3.108,HUBERT,'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
45623,45624,King John,42.0,4.3.109,HUBERT,"I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep"
45624,45625,King John,42.0,4.3.110,HUBERT,My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
45625,45626,King John,43.0,4.3.111,SALISBURY,"Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,"
45626,45627,King John,43.0,4.3.112,SALISBURY,"For villany is not without such rheum,"
45627,45628,King John,43.0,4.3.113,SALISBURY,"And he, long traded in it, makes it seem"
45628,45629,King John,43.0,4.3.114,SALISBURY,Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
45629,45630,King John,43.0,4.3.115,SALISBURY,"Away with me, all you whose souls abhor"
45630,45631,King John,43.0,4.3.116,SALISBURY,"The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house,"
45631,45632,King John,43.0,4.3.117,SALISBURY,For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
45632,45633,King John,44.0,4.3.118,BIGOT,"Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!"
45633,45634,King John,45.0,4.3.119,PEMBROKE,There tell the king he may inquire us out.
45634,45635,King John,45.0,,PEMBROKE,Exeunt Lords
45635,45636,King John,46.0,4.3.120,BASTARD,Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
45636,45637,King John,46.0,4.3.121,BASTARD,Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
45637,45638,King John,46.0,4.3.122,BASTARD,"Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,"
45638,45639,King John,46.0,4.3.123,BASTARD,"Art thou damn'd, Hubert."
45639,45640,King John,47.0,4.3.124,HUBERT,"Do but hear me, sir."
45640,45641,King John,48.0,4.3.125,BASTARD,"Ha! I'll tell thee what,"
45641,45642,King John,48.0,4.3.126,BASTARD,"Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black,"
45642,45643,King John,48.0,4.3.127,BASTARD,Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
45643,45644,King John,48.0,4.3.128,BASTARD,There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
45644,45645,King John,48.0,4.3.129,BASTARD,"As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child."
45645,45646,King John,49.0,4.3.130,HUBERT,Upon my soul--
45646,45647,King John,50.0,4.3.131,BASTARD,If thou didst but consent
45647,45648,King John,50.0,4.3.132,BASTARD,"To this most cruel act, do but despair,"
45648,45649,King John,50.0,4.3.133,BASTARD,"And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread"
45649,45650,King John,50.0,4.3.134,BASTARD,That ever spider twisted from her womb
45650,45651,King John,50.0,4.3.135,BASTARD,"Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam"
45651,45652,King John,50.0,4.3.136,BASTARD,"To hang thee on, or wouldst thou drown thyself,"
45652,45653,King John,50.0,4.3.137,BASTARD,"Put but a little water in a spoon,"
45653,45654,King John,50.0,4.3.138,BASTARD,"And it shall be as all the ocean,"
45654,45655,King John,50.0,4.3.139,BASTARD,Enough to stifle such a villain up.
45655,45656,King John,50.0,4.3.140,BASTARD,I do suspect thee very grievously.
45656,45657,King John,51.0,4.3.141,HUBERT,"If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,"
45657,45658,King John,51.0,4.3.142,HUBERT,Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
45658,45659,King John,51.0,4.3.143,HUBERT,"Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,"
45659,45660,King John,51.0,4.3.144,HUBERT,Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
45660,45661,King John,51.0,4.3.145,HUBERT,I left him well.
45661,45662,King John,52.0,4.3.146,BASTARD,"Go, bear him in thine arms."
45662,45663,King John,52.0,4.3.147,BASTARD,"I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way"
45663,45664,King John,52.0,4.3.148,BASTARD,Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
45664,45665,King John,52.0,4.3.149,BASTARD,How easy dost thou take all England up!
45665,45666,King John,52.0,4.3.150,BASTARD,"From forth this morsel of dead royalty,"
45666,45667,King John,52.0,4.3.151,BASTARD,"The life, the right and truth of all this realm"
45667,45668,King John,52.0,4.3.152,BASTARD,"Is fled to heaven, and England now is left"
45668,45669,King John,52.0,4.3.153,BASTARD,To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
45669,45670,King John,52.0,4.3.154,BASTARD,The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
45670,45671,King John,52.0,4.3.155,BASTARD,Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
45671,45672,King John,52.0,4.3.156,BASTARD,Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
45672,45673,King John,52.0,4.3.157,BASTARD,And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
45673,45674,King John,52.0,4.3.158,BASTARD,Now powers from home and discontents at home
45674,45675,King John,52.0,4.3.159,BASTARD,"Meet in one line, and vast confusion waits,"
45675,45676,King John,52.0,4.3.160,BASTARD,"As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,"
45676,45677,King John,52.0,4.3.161,BASTARD,The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
45677,45678,King John,52.0,4.3.162,BASTARD,Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
45678,45679,King John,52.0,4.3.163,BASTARD,Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
45679,45680,King John,52.0,4.3.164,BASTARD,And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
45680,45681,King John,52.0,4.3.165,BASTARD,"A thousand businesses are brief in hand,"
45681,45682,King John,52.0,4.3.166,BASTARD,And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.

45686,45687,King John,1.0,5.1.1,KING JOHN,Thus have I yielded up into your hand
45687,45688,King John,1.0,5.1.2,KING JOHN,The circle of my glory.
45688,45689,King John,1.0,,KING JOHN,Giving the crown
45689,45690,King John,2.0,5.1.3,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Take again
45690,45691,King John,2.0,5.1.4,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"From this my hand, as holding of the pope"
45691,45692,King John,2.0,5.1.5,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Your sovereign greatness and authority.

45696,45697,King John,3.0,5.1.10,KING JOHN,"Our people quarrel with obedience,"
45697,45698,King John,3.0,5.1.11,KING JOHN,Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
45698,45699,King John,3.0,5.1.12,KING JOHN,"To stranger blood, to foreign royalty."
45699,45700,King John,3.0,5.1.13,KING JOHN,This inundation of mistemper'd humour
45700,45701,King John,3.0,5.1.14,KING JOHN,Rests by you only to be qualified:
45701,45702,King John,3.0,5.1.15,KING JOHN,"Then pause not, for the present time's so sick,"
45702,45703,King John,3.0,5.1.16,KING JOHN,"That present medicine must be minister'd,"
45703,45704,King John,3.0,5.1.17,KING JOHN,Or overthrow incurable ensues.
45704,45705,King John,4.0,5.1.18,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"It was my breath that blew this tempest up,"
45705,45706,King John,4.0,5.1.19,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Upon your stubborn usage of the pope,"
45706,45707,King John,4.0,5.1.20,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"But since you are a gentle convertite,"
45707,45708,King John,4.0,5.1.21,CARDINAL PANDULPH,My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
45708,45709,King John,4.0,5.1.22,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And make fair weather in your blustering land.
45709,45710,King John,4.0,5.1.23,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"On this Ascension-day, remember well,"
45710,45711,King John,4.0,5.1.24,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Upon your oath of service to the pope,"
45711,45712,King John,4.0,5.1.25,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
45712,45713,King John,4.0,,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Exit
45713,45714,King John,5.0,5.1.26,KING JOHN,Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
45714,45715,King John,5.0,5.1.27,KING JOHN,Say that before Ascension-day at noon
45715,45716,King John,5.0,5.1.28,KING JOHN,My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
45716,45717,King John,5.0,5.1.29,KING JOHN,I did suppose it should be on constraint:
45717,45718,King John,5.0,5.1.30,KING JOHN,"But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary."
45718,45719,King John,5.0,,KING JOHN,Enter the BASTARD
45719,45720,King John,6.0,5.1.31,BASTARD,"All Kent hath yielded, nothing there holds out"
45720,45721,King John,6.0,5.1.32,BASTARD,"But Dover castle: London hath received,"
45721,45722,King John,6.0,5.1.33,BASTARD,"Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:"
45722,45723,King John,6.0,5.1.34,BASTARD,"Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone"
45723,45724,King John,6.0,5.1.35,BASTARD,"To offer service to your enemy,"
45724,45725,King John,6.0,5.1.36,BASTARD,And wild amazement hurries up and down
45725,45726,King John,6.0,5.1.37,BASTARD,The little number of your doubtful friends.
45726,45727,King John,7.0,5.1.38,KING JOHN,"Would not my lords return to me again,"
45727,45728,King John,7.0,5.1.39,KING JOHN,After they heard young Arthur was alive?
45728,45729,King John,8.0,5.1.40,BASTARD,"They found him dead and cast into the streets,"
45729,45730,King John,8.0,5.1.41,BASTARD,"An empty casket, where the jewel of life"
45730,45731,King John,8.0,5.1.42,BASTARD,By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.
45731,45732,King John,9.0,5.1.43,KING JOHN,That villain Hubert told me he did live.
45732,45733,King John,10.0,5.1.44,BASTARD,"So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew."
45733,45734,King John,10.0,5.1.45,BASTARD,But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
45734,45735,King John,10.0,5.1.46,BASTARD,"Be great in act, as you have been in thought,"
45735,45736,King John,10.0,5.1.47,BASTARD,Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
45736,45737,King John,10.0,5.1.48,BASTARD,Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
45737,45738,King John,10.0,5.1.49,BASTARD,"Be stirring as the time, be fire with fire,"
45738,45739,King John,10.0,5.1.50,BASTARD,Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
45739,45740,King John,10.0,5.1.51,BASTARD,"Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,"
45740,45741,King John,10.0,5.1.52,BASTARD,"That borrow their behaviors from the great,"
45741,45742,King John,10.0,5.1.53,BASTARD,Grow great by your example and put on
45742,45743,King John,10.0,5.1.54,BASTARD,The dauntless spirit of resolution.
45743,45744,King John,10.0,5.1.55,BASTARD,"Away, and glister like the god of war,"
45744,45745,King John,10.0,5.1.56,BASTARD,When he intendeth to become the field:
45745,45746,King John,10.0,5.1.57,BASTARD,Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
45746,45747,King John,10.0,5.1.58,BASTARD,"What, shall they seek the lion in his den,"
45747,45748,King John,10.0,5.1.59,BASTARD,And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
45748,45749,King John,10.0,5.1.60,BASTARD,"O, let it not be said: forage, and run"
45749,45750,King John,10.0,5.1.61,BASTARD,"To meet displeasure farther from the doors,"
45750,45751,King John,10.0,5.1.62,BASTARD,And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.
45751,45752,King John,11.0,5.1.63,KING JOHN,"The legate of the pope hath been with me,"
45752,45753,King John,11.0,5.1.64,KING JOHN,"And I have made a happy peace with him,"
45753,45754,King John,11.0,5.1.65,KING JOHN,And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
45754,45755,King John,11.0,5.1.66,KING JOHN,Led by the Dauphin.
45755,45756,King John,12.0,5.1.67,BASTARD,O inglorious league!
45756,45757,King John,12.0,5.1.68,BASTARD,"Shall we, upon the footing of our land,"
45757,45758,King John,12.0,5.1.69,BASTARD,"Send fair-play orders and make compromise,"
45758,45759,King John,12.0,5.1.70,BASTARD,"Insinuation, parley and base truce"
45759,45760,King John,12.0,5.1.71,BASTARD,"To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,"
45760,45761,King John,12.0,5.1.72,BASTARD,"A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,"
45761,45762,King John,12.0,5.1.73,BASTARD,"And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,"
45762,45763,King John,12.0,5.1.74,BASTARD,"Mocking the air with colours idly spread,"
45763,45764,King John,12.0,5.1.75,BASTARD,"And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:"
45764,45765,King John,12.0,5.1.76,BASTARD,"Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace,"
45765,45766,King John,12.0,5.1.77,BASTARD,"Or if he do, let it at least be said"
45766,45767,King John,12.0,5.1.78,BASTARD,They saw we had a purpose of defence.
45767,45768,King John,13.0,5.1.79,KING JOHN,Have thou the ordering of this present time.
45768,45769,King John,14.0,5.1.80,BASTARD,"Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,"
45769,45770,King John,14.0,5.1.81,BASTARD,Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
45770,45771,King John,14.0,,BASTARD,Exeunt
45771,45772,King John,14.0,,BASTARD,SCENE II. LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.
45772,45773,King John,14.0,,BASTARD,"Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and Soldiers"
45773,45774,King John,1.0,5.2.1,LEWIS,"My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,"
45774,45775,King John,1.0,5.2.2,LEWIS,And keep it safe for our remembrance:
45775,45776,King John,1.0,5.2.3,LEWIS,"Return the precedent to these lords again,"
45776,45777,King John,1.0,5.2.4,LEWIS,"That, having our fair order written down,"
45777,45778,King John,1.0,5.2.5,LEWIS,"Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,"
45778,45779,King John,1.0,5.2.6,LEWIS,May know wherefore we took the sacrament
45779,45780,King John,1.0,5.2.7,LEWIS,And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
45780,45781,King John,2.0,5.2.8,SALISBURY,Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
45781,45782,King John,2.0,5.2.9,SALISBURY,"And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear"
45782,45783,King John,2.0,5.2.10,SALISBURY,A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
45783,45784,King John,2.0,5.2.11,SALISBURY,"To your proceedings, yet believe me, prince,"
45784,45785,King John,2.0,5.2.12,SALISBURY,I am not glad that such a sore of time
45785,45786,King John,2.0,5.2.13,SALISBURY,"Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,"
45786,45787,King John,2.0,5.2.14,SALISBURY,And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
45787,45788,King John,2.0,5.2.15,SALISBURY,"By making many. O, it grieves my soul,"
45788,45789,King John,2.0,5.2.16,SALISBURY,That I must draw this metal from my side
45789,45790,King John,2.0,5.2.17,SALISBURY,"To be a widow-maker! O, and there"
45790,45791,King John,2.0,5.2.18,SALISBURY,Where honourable rescue and defence
45791,45792,King John,2.0,5.2.19,SALISBURY,Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
45792,45793,King John,2.0,5.2.20,SALISBURY,"But such is the infection of the time,"
45793,45794,King John,2.0,5.2.21,SALISBURY,"That, for the health and physic of our right,"
45794,45795,King John,2.0,5.2.22,SALISBURY,We cannot deal but with the very hand
45795,45796,King John,2.0,5.2.23,SALISBURY,Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
45796,45797,King John,2.0,5.2.24,SALISBURY,"And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,"
45797,45798,King John,2.0,5.2.25,SALISBURY,"That we, the sons and children of this isle,"
45798,45799,King John,2.0,5.2.26,SALISBURY,"Were born to see so sad an hour as this,"
45799,45800,King John,2.0,5.2.27,SALISBURY,Wherein we step after a stranger march
45800,45801,King John,2.0,5.2.28,SALISBURY,"Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up"
45801,45802,King John,2.0,5.2.29,SALISBURY,"Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep"
45802,45803,King John,2.0,5.2.30,SALISBURY,"Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--"
45803,45804,King John,2.0,5.2.31,SALISBURY,"To grace the gentry of a land remote,"
45804,45805,King John,2.0,5.2.32,SALISBURY,And follow unacquainted colours here?
45805,45806,King John,2.0,5.2.33,SALISBURY,"What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!"
45806,45807,King John,2.0,5.2.34,SALISBURY,"That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,"
45807,45808,King John,2.0,5.2.35,SALISBURY,"Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,"
45808,45809,King John,2.0,5.2.36,SALISBURY,"And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,"
45809,45810,King John,2.0,5.2.37,SALISBURY,Where these two Christian armies might combine
45810,45811,King John,2.0,5.2.38,SALISBURY,"The blood of malice in a vein of league,"
45811,45812,King John,2.0,5.2.39,SALISBURY,And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
45812,45813,King John,3.0,5.2.40,LEWIS,"A noble temper dost thou show in this,"
45813,45814,King John,3.0,5.2.41,LEWIS,And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
45814,45815,King John,3.0,5.2.42,LEWIS,Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
45815,45816,King John,3.0,5.2.43,LEWIS,"O, what a noble combat hast thou fought"
45816,45817,King John,3.0,5.2.44,LEWIS,Between compulsion and a brave respect!
45817,45818,King John,3.0,5.2.45,LEWIS,"Let me wipe off this honourable dew,"
45818,45819,King John,3.0,5.2.46,LEWIS,That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
45819,45820,King John,3.0,5.2.47,LEWIS,"My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,"
45820,45821,King John,3.0,5.2.48,LEWIS,"Being an ordinary inundation,"
45821,45822,King John,3.0,5.2.49,LEWIS,"But this effusion of such manly drops,"
45822,45823,King John,3.0,5.2.50,LEWIS,"This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,"
45823,45824,King John,3.0,5.2.51,LEWIS,"Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed"
45824,45825,King John,3.0,5.2.52,LEWIS,Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
45825,45826,King John,3.0,5.2.53,LEWIS,Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
45826,45827,King John,3.0,5.2.54,LEWIS,"Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,"
45827,45828,King John,3.0,5.2.55,LEWIS,And with a great heart heave away the storm:
45828,45829,King John,3.0,5.2.56,LEWIS,Commend these waters to those baby eyes
45829,45830,King John,3.0,5.2.57,LEWIS,"That never saw the giant world enraged,"
45830,45831,King John,3.0,5.2.58,LEWIS,"Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,"
45831,45832,King John,3.0,5.2.59,LEWIS,"Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping."
45832,45833,King John,3.0,5.2.60,LEWIS,"Come, come, for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep"
45833,45834,King John,3.0,5.2.61,LEWIS,Into the purse of rich prosperity
45834,45835,King John,3.0,5.2.62,LEWIS,"As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,"
45835,45836,King John,3.0,5.2.63,LEWIS,That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
45836,45837,King John,3.0,5.2.64,LEWIS,"And even there, methinks, an angel spake:"
45837,45838,King John,3.0,,LEWIS,Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
45838,45839,King John,3.0,5.2.65,LEWIS,"Look, where the holy legate comes apace,"
45839,45840,King John,3.0,5.2.66,LEWIS,To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
45840,45841,King John,3.0,5.2.67,LEWIS,And on our actions set the name of right
45841,45842,King John,3.0,5.2.68,LEWIS,With holy breath.
45842,45843,King John,4.0,5.2.69,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Hail, noble prince of France!"
45843,45844,King John,4.0,5.2.70,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The next is this, King John hath reconciled"
45844,45845,King John,4.0,5.2.71,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Himself to Rome, his spirit is come in,"
45845,45846,King John,4.0,5.2.72,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That so stood out against the holy church,"
45846,45847,King John,4.0,5.2.73,CARDINAL PANDULPH,The great metropolis and see of Rome:
45847,45848,King John,4.0,5.2.74,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up,"
45848,45849,King John,4.0,5.2.75,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And tame the savage spirit of wild war,"
45849,45850,King John,4.0,5.2.76,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"That like a lion foster'd up at hand,"
45850,45851,King John,4.0,5.2.77,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"It may lie gently at the foot of peace,"
45851,45852,King John,4.0,5.2.78,CARDINAL PANDULPH,And be no further harmful than in show.
45852,45853,King John,5.0,5.2.79,LEWIS,"Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:"
45853,45854,King John,5.0,5.2.80,LEWIS,"I am too high-born to be propertied,"
45854,45855,King John,5.0,5.2.81,LEWIS,"To be a secondary at control,"
45855,45856,King John,5.0,5.2.82,LEWIS,"Or useful serving-man and instrument,"
45856,45857,King John,5.0,5.2.83,LEWIS,To any sovereign state throughout the world.
45857,45858,King John,5.0,5.2.84,LEWIS,Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
45858,45859,King John,5.0,5.2.85,LEWIS,"Between this chastised kingdom and myself,"
45859,45860,King John,5.0,5.2.86,LEWIS,"And brought in matter that should feed this fire,"
45860,45861,King John,5.0,5.2.87,LEWIS,And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
45861,45862,King John,5.0,5.2.88,LEWIS,With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
45862,45863,King John,5.0,5.2.89,LEWIS,"You taught me how to know the face of right,"
45863,45864,King John,5.0,5.2.90,LEWIS,"Acquainted me with interest to this land,"
45864,45865,King John,5.0,5.2.91,LEWIS,"Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart,"
45865,45866,King John,5.0,5.2.92,LEWIS,And come ye now to tell me John hath made
45866,45867,King John,5.0,5.2.93,LEWIS,His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
45867,45868,King John,5.0,5.2.94,LEWIS,"I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,"
45868,45869,King John,5.0,5.2.95,LEWIS,"After young Arthur, claim this land for mine,"
45869,45870,King John,5.0,5.2.96,LEWIS,"And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back"
45870,45871,King John,5.0,5.2.97,LEWIS,Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
45871,45872,King John,5.0,5.2.98,LEWIS,"Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,"
45872,45873,King John,5.0,5.2.99,LEWIS,"What men provided, what munition sent,"
45873,45874,King John,5.0,5.2.100,LEWIS,To underprop this action? Is't not I
45874,45875,King John,5.0,5.2.101,LEWIS,"That undergo this charge? who else but I,"
45875,45876,King John,5.0,5.2.102,LEWIS,"And such as to my claim are liable,"
45876,45877,King John,5.0,5.2.103,LEWIS,Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
45877,45878,King John,5.0,5.2.104,LEWIS,Have I not heard these islanders shout out
45878,45879,King John,5.0,5.2.105,LEWIS,'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
45879,45880,King John,5.0,5.2.106,LEWIS,"Have I not here the best cards for the game,"
45880,45881,King John,5.0,5.2.107,LEWIS,To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
45881,45882,King John,5.0,5.2.108,LEWIS,And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
45882,45883,King John,5.0,5.2.109,LEWIS,"No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said."
45883,45884,King John,6.0,5.2.110,CARDINAL PANDULPH,You look but on the outside of this work.
45884,45885,King John,7.0,5.2.111,LEWIS,"Outside or inside, I will not return"
45885,45886,King John,7.0,5.2.112,LEWIS,Till my attempt so much be glorified
45886,45887,King John,7.0,5.2.113,LEWIS,As to my ample hope was promised
45887,45888,King John,7.0,5.2.114,LEWIS,"Before I drew this gallant head of war,"
45888,45889,King John,7.0,5.2.115,LEWIS,"And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,"
45889,45890,King John,7.0,5.2.116,LEWIS,To outlook conquest and to win renown
45890,45891,King John,7.0,5.2.117,LEWIS,Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
45891,45892,King John,7.0,,LEWIS,Trumpet sounds
45892,45893,King John,7.0,5.2.118,LEWIS,What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
45893,45894,King John,7.0,,LEWIS,"Enter the BASTARD, attended"
45894,45895,King John,8.0,5.2.119,BASTARD,"According to the fair play of the world,"
45895,45896,King John,8.0,5.2.120,BASTARD,"Let me have audience, I am sent to speak:"
45896,45897,King John,8.0,5.2.121,BASTARD,"My holy lord of Milan, from the king"
45897,45898,King John,8.0,5.2.122,BASTARD,"I come, to learn how you have dealt for him,"
45898,45899,King John,8.0,5.2.123,BASTARD,"And, as you answer, I do know the scope"
45899,45900,King John,8.0,5.2.124,BASTARD,And warrant limited unto my tongue.
45900,45901,King John,9.0,5.2.125,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,"
45901,45902,King John,9.0,5.2.126,CARDINAL PANDULPH,"And will not temporize with my entreaties,"
45902,45903,King John,9.0,5.2.127,CARDINAL PANDULPH,He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
45903,45904,King John,10.0,5.2.128,BASTARD,"By all the blood that ever fury breathed,"
45904,45905,King John,10.0,5.2.129,BASTARD,"The youth says well. Now hear our English king,"
45905,45906,King John,10.0,5.2.130,BASTARD,For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
45906,45907,King John,10.0,5.2.131,BASTARD,"He is prepared, and reason too he should:"
45907,45908,King John,10.0,5.2.132,BASTARD,"This apish and unmannerly approach,"
45908,45909,King John,10.0,5.2.133,BASTARD,"This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,"
45909,45910,King John,10.0,5.2.134,BASTARD,"This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,"
45910,45911,King John,10.0,5.2.135,BASTARD,"The king doth smile at, and is well prepared"
45911,45912,King John,10.0,5.2.136,BASTARD,"To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,"
45912,45913,King John,10.0,5.2.137,BASTARD,From out the circle of his territories.
45913,45914,King John,10.0,5.2.138,BASTARD,"That hand which had the strength, even at your door,"

45915,45916,King John,10.0,5.2.140,BASTARD,"To dive like buckets in concealed wells,"
45916,45917,King John,10.0,5.2.141,BASTARD,"To crouch in litter of your stable planks,"
45917,45918,King John,10.0,5.2.142,BASTARD,"To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,"
45918,45919,King John,10.0,5.2.143,BASTARD,"To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out"
45919,45920,King John,10.0,5.2.144,BASTARD,"In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake"
45920,45921,King John,10.0,5.2.145,BASTARD,"Even at the crying of your nation's crow,"
45921,45922,King John,10.0,5.2.146,BASTARD,"Thinking his voice an armed Englishman,"
45922,45923,King John,10.0,5.2.147,BASTARD,"Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,"
45923,45924,King John,10.0,5.2.148,BASTARD,That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
45924,45925,King John,10.0,5.2.149,BASTARD,No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
45925,45926,King John,10.0,5.2.150,BASTARD,"And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,"
45926,45927,King John,10.0,5.2.151,BASTARD,To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
45927,45928,King John,10.0,5.2.152,BASTARD,"And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,"
45928,45929,King John,10.0,5.2.153,BASTARD,"You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb"
45929,45930,King John,10.0,5.2.154,BASTARD,"Of your dear mother England, blush for shame,"
45930,45931,King John,10.0,5.2.155,BASTARD,For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
45931,45932,King John,10.0,5.2.156,BASTARD,"Like Amazons come tripping after drums,"
45932,45933,King John,10.0,5.2.157,BASTARD,"Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,"
45933,45934,King John,10.0,5.2.158,BASTARD,"Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts"
45934,45935,King John,10.0,5.2.159,BASTARD,To fierce and bloody inclination.
45935,45936,King John,11.0,5.2.160,LEWIS,"There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace,"
45936,45937,King John,11.0,5.2.161,LEWIS,"We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well,"
45937,45938,King John,11.0,5.2.162,LEWIS,We hold our time too precious to be spent
45938,45939,King John,11.0,5.2.163,LEWIS,With such a brabbler.
45939,45940,King John,12.0,5.2.164,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Give me leave to speak.
45940,45941,King John,13.0,5.2.165,BASTARD,"No, I will speak."
45941,45942,King John,14.0,5.2.166,LEWIS,We will attend to neither.
45942,45943,King John,14.0,5.2.167,LEWIS,"Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war"
45943,45944,King John,14.0,5.2.168,LEWIS,Plead for our interest and our being here.
45944,45945,King John,15.0,5.2.169,BASTARD,"Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out,"
45945,45946,King John,15.0,5.2.170,BASTARD,"And so shall you, being beaten: do but start"
45946,45947,King John,15.0,5.2.171,BASTARD,"An echo with the clamour of thy drum,"
45947,45948,King John,15.0,5.2.172,BASTARD,And even at hand a drum is ready braced
45948,45949,King John,15.0,5.2.173,BASTARD,"That shall reverberate all as loud as thine,"
45949,45950,King John,15.0,5.2.174,BASTARD,"Sound but another, and another shall"
45950,45951,King John,15.0,5.2.175,BASTARD,As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
45951,45952,King John,15.0,5.2.176,BASTARD,"And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,"
45952,45953,King John,15.0,5.2.177,BASTARD,"Not trusting to this halting legate here,"
45953,45954,King John,15.0,5.2.178,BASTARD,Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
45954,45955,King John,15.0,5.2.179,BASTARD,"Is warlike John, and in his forehead sits"
45955,45956,King John,15.0,5.2.180,BASTARD,"A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day"
45956,45957,King John,15.0,5.2.181,BASTARD,To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
45957,45958,King John,16.0,5.2.182,LEWIS,"Strike up our drums, to find this danger out."

45964,45965,King John,3.0,5.3.3,KING JOHN,"This fever, that hath troubled me so long,"
45965,45966,King John,3.0,5.3.4,KING JOHN,"Lies heavy on me, O, my heart is sick!"
45966,45967,King John,3.0,,KING JOHN,Enter a Messenger

45969,45970,King John,4.0,5.3.7,Messenger,And send him word by me which way you go.

45977,45978,King John,7.0,5.3.15,KING JOHN,And will not let me welcome this good news.

46000,46001,King John,9.0,5.4.17,MELUN,By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn

46002,46003,King John,9.0,5.4.19,MELUN,"Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury,"

46037,46038,King John,12.0,5.4.54,SALISBURY,"And like a bated and retired flood,"
46038,46039,King John,12.0,5.4.55,SALISBURY,"Leaving our rankness and irregular course,"
46039,46040,King John,12.0,5.4.56,SALISBURY,Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
46040,46041,King John,12.0,5.4.57,SALISBURY,And cabby run on in obedience
46041,46042,King John,12.0,5.4.58,SALISBURY,"Even to our ocean, to our great King John."
46042,46043,King John,12.0,5.4.59,SALISBURY,"My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,"
46043,46044,King John,12.0,5.4.60,SALISBURY,For I do see the cruel pangs of death
46044,46045,King John,12.0,5.4.61,SALISBURY,"Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight,"
46045,46046,King John,12.0,5.4.62,SALISBURY,"And happy newness, that intends old right."

46066,46067,King John,5.0,5.5.17,LEWIS,As this hath made me. Who was he that said

46075,46076,King John,7.0,,LEWIS,"Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT, severally"
46076,46077,King John,1.0,5.6.1,HUBERT,"Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot."
46077,46078,King John,2.0,5.6.2,BASTARD,A friend. What art thou?
46078,46079,King John,3.0,5.6.3,HUBERT,Of the part of England.
46079,46080,King John,4.0,5.6.4,BASTARD,Whither dost thou go?
46080,46081,King John,5.0,5.6.5,HUBERT,What's that to thee? why may not I demand
46081,46082,King John,5.0,5.6.6,HUBERT,"Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?"
46082,46083,King John,6.0,5.6.7,BASTARD,"Hubert, I think?"
46083,46084,King John,7.0,5.6.8,HUBERT,Thou hast a perfect thought:
46084,46085,King John,7.0,5.6.9,HUBERT,I will upon all hazards well believe
46085,46086,King John,7.0,5.6.10,HUBERT,"Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well."
46086,46087,King John,7.0,5.6.11,HUBERT,Who art thou?
46087,46088,King John,8.0,5.6.12,BASTARD,"Who thou wilt: and if thou please,"
46088,46089,King John,8.0,5.6.13,BASTARD,Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
46089,46090,King John,8.0,5.6.14,BASTARD,I come one way of the Plantagenets.
46090,46091,King John,9.0,5.6.15,HUBERT,Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
46091,46092,King John,9.0,5.6.16,HUBERT,"Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,"
46092,46093,King John,9.0,5.6.17,HUBERT,That any accent breaking from thy tongue
46093,46094,King John,9.0,5.6.18,HUBERT,Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
46094,46095,King John,10.0,5.6.19,BASTARD,"Come, come, sans compliment, what news abroad?"
46095,46096,King John,11.0,5.6.20,HUBERT,"Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,"
46096,46097,King John,11.0,5.6.21,HUBERT,To find you out.
46097,46098,King John,12.0,5.6.22,BASTARD,"Brief, then, and what's the news?"
46098,46099,King John,13.0,5.6.23,HUBERT,"O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,"
46099,46100,King John,13.0,5.6.24,HUBERT,"Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible."
46100,46101,King John,14.0,5.6.25,BASTARD,Show me the very wound of this ill news:
46101,46102,King John,14.0,5.6.26,BASTARD,"I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it."
46102,46103,King John,15.0,5.6.27,HUBERT,"The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:"
46103,46104,King John,15.0,5.6.28,HUBERT,"I left him almost speechless, and broke out"
46104,46105,King John,15.0,5.6.29,HUBERT,"To acquaint you with this evil, that you might"
46105,46106,King John,15.0,5.6.30,HUBERT,"The better arm you to the sudden time,"
46106,46107,King John,15.0,5.6.31,HUBERT,Than if you had at leisure known of this.
46107,46108,King John,16.0,5.6.32,BASTARD,How did he take it? who did taste to him?
46108,46109,King John,17.0,5.6.33,HUBERT,"A monk, I tell you, a resolved villain,"
46109,46110,King John,17.0,5.6.34,HUBERT,Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
46110,46111,King John,17.0,5.6.35,HUBERT,Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
46111,46112,King John,18.0,5.6.36,BASTARD,Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
46112,46113,King John,19.0,5.6.37,HUBERT,"Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,"
46113,46114,King John,19.0,5.6.38,HUBERT,"And brought Prince Henry in their company,"
46114,46115,King John,19.0,5.6.39,HUBERT,"At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,"
46115,46116,King John,19.0,5.6.40,HUBERT,And they are all about his majesty.
46116,46117,King John,20.0,5.6.41,BASTARD,"Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,"
46117,46118,King John,20.0,5.6.42,BASTARD,And tempt us not to bear above our power!
46118,46119,King John,20.0,5.6.43,BASTARD,"I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,"
46119,46120,King John,20.0,5.6.44,BASTARD,"Passing these flats, are taken by the tide,"
46120,46121,King John,20.0,5.6.45,BASTARD,"These Lincoln Washes have devoured them,"
46121,46122,King John,20.0,5.6.46,BASTARD,"Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped."
46122,46123,King John,20.0,5.6.47,BASTARD,"Away before: conduct me to the king,"
46123,46124,King John,20.0,5.6.48,BASTARD,I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
46124,46125,King John,20.0,,BASTARD,Exeunt
46125,46126,King John,20.0,,BASTARD,SCENE VII. The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.
46126,46127,King John,20.0,,BASTARD,"Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT"
46127,46128,King John,1.0,5.7.1,PRINCE HENRY,It is too late: the life of all his blood
46128,46129,King John,1.0,5.7.2,PRINCE HENRY,"Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,"
46129,46130,King John,1.0,5.7.3,PRINCE HENRY,"Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,"
46130,46131,King John,1.0,5.7.4,PRINCE HENRY,Doth by the idle comments that it makes
46131,46132,King John,1.0,5.7.5,PRINCE HENRY,Foretell the ending of mortality.
46132,46133,King John,1.0,,PRINCE HENRY,Enter PEMBROKE
46133,46134,King John,2.0,5.7.6,PEMBROKE,"His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief"
46134,46135,King John,2.0,5.7.7,PEMBROKE,"That, being brought into the open air,"
46135,46136,King John,2.0,5.7.8,PEMBROKE,It would allay the burning quality
46136,46137,King John,2.0,5.7.9,PEMBROKE,Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
46137,46138,King John,3.0,5.7.10,PRINCE HENRY,Let him be brought into the orchard here.
46138,46139,King John,3.0,5.7.11,PRINCE HENRY,Doth he still rage?
46139,46140,King John,3.0,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit BIGOT
46140,46141,King John,4.0,5.7.12,PEMBROKE,He is more patient
46141,46142,King John,4.0,5.7.13,PEMBROKE,"Than when you left him, even now he sung."
46142,46143,King John,5.0,5.7.14,PRINCE HENRY,O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
46143,46144,King John,5.0,5.7.15,PRINCE HENRY,In their continuance will not feel themselves.
46144,46145,King John,5.0,5.7.16,PRINCE HENRY,"Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,"
46145,46146,King John,5.0,5.7.17,PRINCE HENRY,"Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now"
46146,46147,King John,5.0,5.7.18,PRINCE HENRY,"Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds"
46147,46148,King John,5.0,5.7.19,PRINCE HENRY,"With many legions of strange fantasies,"
46148,46149,King John,5.0,5.7.20,PRINCE HENRY,"Whi ch, in their throng and press to that last hold,"
46149,46150,King John,5.0,5.7.21,PRINCE HENRY,Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death
46150,46151,King John,5.0,5.7.22,PRINCE HENRY,should sing.
46151,46152,King John,5.0,5.7.23,PRINCE HENRY,"I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,"
46152,46153,King John,5.0,5.7.24,PRINCE HENRY,"Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,"
46153,46154,King John,5.0,5.7.25,PRINCE HENRY,And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
46154,46155,King John,5.0,5.7.26,PRINCE HENRY,His soul and body to their lasting rest.
46155,46156,King John,6.0,5.7.27,SALISBURY,"Be of good comfort, prince, for you are born"
46156,46157,King John,6.0,5.7.28,SALISBURY,To set a form upon that indigest
46157,46158,King John,6.0,5.7.29,SALISBURY,Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
46158,46159,King John,6.0,,SALISBURY,"Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair"
46159,46160,King John,7.0,5.7.30,KING JOHN,"Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room,"
46160,46161,King John,7.0,5.7.31,KING JOHN,It would not out at windows nor at doors.
46161,46162,King John,7.0,5.7.32,KING JOHN,"There is so hot a summer in my bosom,"
46162,46163,King John,7.0,5.7.33,KING JOHN,That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
46163,46164,King John,7.0,5.7.34,KING JOHN,"I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen"
46164,46165,King John,7.0,5.7.35,KING JOHN,"Upon a parchment, and against this fire"
46165,46166,King John,7.0,5.7.36,KING JOHN,Do I shrink up.
46166,46167,King John,8.0,5.7.37,PRINCE HENRY,How fares your majesty?
46167,46168,King John,9.0,5.7.38,KING JOHN,"Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:"
46168,46169,King John,9.0,5.7.39,KING JOHN,And none of you will bid the winter come
46169,46170,King John,9.0,5.7.40,KING JOHN,"To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,"
46170,46171,King John,9.0,5.7.41,KING JOHN,Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
46171,46172,King John,9.0,5.7.42,KING JOHN,"Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north"
46172,46173,King John,9.0,5.7.43,KING JOHN,To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
46173,46174,King John,9.0,5.7.44,KING JOHN,"And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,"
46174,46175,King John,9.0,5.7.45,KING JOHN,"I beg cold comfort, and you are so strait"
46175,46176,King John,9.0,5.7.46,KING JOHN,"And so ingrateful, you deny me that."
46176,46177,King John,10.0,5.7.47,PRINCE HENRY,"O that there were some virtue in my tears,"
46177,46178,King John,10.0,5.7.48,PRINCE HENRY,That might relieve you!
46178,46179,King John,11.0,5.7.49,KING JOHN,The salt in them is hot.
46179,46180,King John,11.0,5.7.50,KING JOHN,"Within me is a hell, and there the poison"
46180,46181,King John,11.0,5.7.51,KING JOHN,Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
46181,46182,King John,11.0,5.7.52,KING JOHN,On unreprievable condemned blood.
46182,46183,King John,11.0,,KING JOHN,Enter the BASTARD
46183,46184,King John,12.0,5.7.53,BASTARD,"O, I am scalded with my violent motion,"
46184,46185,King John,12.0,5.7.54,BASTARD,And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
46185,46186,King John,13.0,5.7.55,KING JOHN,"O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:"
46186,46187,King John,13.0,5.7.56,KING JOHN,"The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,"
46187,46188,King John,13.0,5.7.57,KING JOHN,And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
46188,46189,King John,13.0,5.7.58,KING JOHN,"Are turned to one thread, one little hair:"
46189,46190,King John,13.0,5.7.59,KING JOHN,"My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,"
46190,46191,King John,13.0,5.7.60,KING JOHN,"Which holds but till thy news be uttered,"
46191,46192,King John,13.0,5.7.61,KING JOHN,And then all this thou seest is but a clod
46192,46193,King John,13.0,5.7.62,KING JOHN,And module of confounded royalty.
46193,46194,King John,14.0,5.7.63,BASTARD,"The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,"
46194,46195,King John,14.0,5.7.64,BASTARD,"Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him,"
46195,46196,King John,14.0,5.7.65,BASTARD,"For in a night the best part of my power,"
46196,46197,King John,14.0,5.7.66,BASTARD,"As I upon advantage did remove,"
46197,46198,King John,14.0,5.7.67,BASTARD,Were in the Washes all unwarily
46198,46199,King John,14.0,5.7.68,BASTARD,Devoured by the unexpected flood.
46199,46200,King John,14.0,,BASTARD,KING JOHN dies
46200,46201,King John,15.0,5.7.69,SALISBURY,You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
46201,46202,King John,15.0,5.7.70,SALISBURY,"My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus."
46202,46203,King John,16.0,5.7.71,PRINCE HENRY,"Even so must I run on, and even so stop."
46203,46204,King John,16.0,5.7.72,PRINCE HENRY,"What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,"
46204,46205,King John,16.0,5.7.73,PRINCE HENRY,"When this was now a king, and now is clay?"
46205,46206,King John,17.0,5.7.74,BASTARD,Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
46206,46207,King John,17.0,5.7.75,BASTARD,"To do the office for thee of revenge,"
46207,46208,King John,17.0,5.7.76,BASTARD,"And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,"
46208,46209,King John,17.0,5.7.77,BASTARD,As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
46209,46210,King John,17.0,5.7.78,BASTARD,"Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,"
46210,46211,King John,17.0,5.7.79,BASTARD,"Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,"
46211,46212,King John,17.0,5.7.80,BASTARD,"And instantly return with me again,"
46212,46213,King John,17.0,5.7.81,BASTARD,To push destruction and perpetual shame
46213,46214,King John,17.0,5.7.82,BASTARD,Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
46214,46215,King John,17.0,5.7.83,BASTARD,"Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought,"
46215,46216,King John,17.0,5.7.84,BASTARD,The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
46216,46217,King John,18.0,5.7.85,SALISBURY,"It seems you know not, then, so much as we:"
46217,46218,King John,18.0,5.7.86,SALISBURY,"The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,"
46218,46219,King John,18.0,5.7.87,SALISBURY,"Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,"
46219,46220,King John,18.0,5.7.88,SALISBURY,And brings from him such offers of our peace
46220,46221,King John,18.0,5.7.89,SALISBURY,"As we with honour and respect may take,"
46221,46222,King John,18.0,5.7.90,SALISBURY,With purpose presently to leave this war.
46222,46223,King John,19.0,5.7.91,BASTARD,He will the rather do it when he sees
46223,46224,King John,19.0,5.7.92,BASTARD,Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
46224,46225,King John,20.0,5.7.93,SALISBURY,"Nay, it is in a manner done already,"
46225,46226,King John,20.0,5.7.94,SALISBURY,For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
46226,46227,King John,20.0,5.7.95,SALISBURY,"To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel"
46227,46228,King John,20.0,5.7.96,SALISBURY,To the disposing of the cardinal:
46228,46229,King John,20.0,5.7.97,SALISBURY,"With whom yourself, myself and other lords,"
46229,46230,King John,20.0,5.7.98,SALISBURY,"If you think meet, this afternoon will post"
46230,46231,King John,20.0,5.7.99,SALISBURY,To consummate this business happily.
46231,46232,King John,21.0,5.7.100,BASTARD,"Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,"
46232,46233,King John,21.0,5.7.101,BASTARD,"With other princes that may best be spared,"
46233,46234,King John,21.0,5.7.102,BASTARD,Shall wait upon your father's funeral.
46234,46235,King John,22.0,5.7.103,PRINCE HENRY,"At Worcester must his body be interr'd,"
46235,46236,King John,22.0,5.7.104,PRINCE HENRY,For so he will'd it.
46236,46237,King John,23.0,5.7.105,BASTARD,Thither shall it then:
46237,46238,King John,23.0,5.7.106,BASTARD,And happily may your sweet self put on
46238,46239,King John,23.0,5.7.107,BASTARD,The lineal state and glory of the land!
46239,46240,King John,23.0,5.7.108,BASTARD,"To whom with all submission, on my knee"
46240,46241,King John,23.0,5.7.109,BASTARD,I do bequeath my faithful services
46241,46242,King John,23.0,5.7.110,BASTARD,And true subjection everlastingly.
46242,46243,King John,24.0,5.7.111,SALISBURY,"And the like tender of our love we make,"
46243,46244,King John,24.0,5.7.112,SALISBURY,To rest without a spot for evermore.
46244,46245,King John,25.0,5.7.113,PRINCE HENRY,I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
46245,46246,King John,25.0,5.7.114,PRINCE HENRY,And knows not how to do it but with tears.
46246,46247,King John,26.0,5.7.115,BASTARD,"O, let us pay the time but needful woe,"
46247,46248,King John,26.0,5.7.116,BASTARD,Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
46248,46249,King John,26.0,5.7.117,BASTARD,"This England never did, nor never shall,"
46249,46250,King John,26.0,5.7.118,BASTARD,"Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,"
46250,46251,King John,26.0,5.7.119,BASTARD,But when it first did help to wound itself.
46251,46252,King John,26.0,5.7.120,BASTARD,"Now these her princes are come home again,"
46252,46253,King John,26.0,5.7.121,BASTARD,"Come the three corners of the world in arms,"
46253,46254,King John,26.0,5.7.122,BASTARD,"And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,"
46254,46255,King John,26.0,5.7.123,BASTARD,If England to itself do rest but true.
46255,46256,King John,26.0,,BASTARD,Exeunt

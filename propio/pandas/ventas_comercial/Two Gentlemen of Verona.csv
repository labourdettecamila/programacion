105552,105553,Two Gentlemen of Verona,127.0,,Clown,Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
105553,105554,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.1,VALENTINE,"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:"
105554,105555,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.2,VALENTINE,Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
105555,105556,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.3,VALENTINE,Were't not affection chains thy tender days
105556,105557,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.4,VALENTINE,"To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,"
105557,105558,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.5,VALENTINE,I rather would entreat thy company
105558,105559,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.6,VALENTINE,"To see the wonders of the world abroad,"
105559,105560,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.7,VALENTINE,"Than, living dully sluggardized at home,"
105560,105561,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.8,VALENTINE,Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
105561,105562,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.9,VALENTINE,"But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,"
105562,105563,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.1.10,VALENTINE,Even as I would when I to love begin.
105563,105564,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.11,PROTEUS,"Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!"
105564,105565,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.12,PROTEUS,"Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest"
105565,105566,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.13,PROTEUS,Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
105566,105567,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.14,PROTEUS,Wish me partaker in thy happiness
105567,105568,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.15,PROTEUS,"When thou dost meet good hap, and in thy danger,"
105568,105569,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.16,PROTEUS,"If ever danger do environ thee,"
105569,105570,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.17,PROTEUS,"Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,"
105570,105571,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.1.18,PROTEUS,"For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine."
105571,105572,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.1.19,VALENTINE,And on a love-book pray for my success?
105572,105573,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.1.20,PROTEUS,Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
105573,105574,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.1.21,VALENTINE,That's on some shallow story of deep love:
105574,105575,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.1.22,VALENTINE,How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
105575,105576,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.1.23,PROTEUS,That's a deep story of a deeper love:
105576,105577,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.1.24,PROTEUS,For he was more than over shoes in love.
105577,105578,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.1.25,VALENTINE,"'Tis true, for you are over boots in love,"
105578,105579,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.1.26,VALENTINE,And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
105579,105580,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.1.27,PROTEUS,"Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots."
105580,105581,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,1.1.28,VALENTINE,"No, I will not, for it boots thee not."
105581,105582,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,1.1.29,PROTEUS,What?
105582,105583,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.30,VALENTINE,"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans,"
105583,105584,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.31,VALENTINE,"Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment's mirth"
105584,105585,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.32,VALENTINE,"With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:"
105585,105586,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.33,VALENTINE,"If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain,"
105586,105587,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.34,VALENTINE,"If lost, why then a grievous labour won,"
105587,105588,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.35,VALENTINE,"However, but a folly bought with wit,"
105588,105589,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.1.36,VALENTINE,Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
105589,105590,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.1.37,PROTEUS,"So, by your circumstance, you call me fool."
105590,105591,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,1.1.38,VALENTINE,"So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove."
105591,105592,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,1.1.39,PROTEUS,'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
105592,105593,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.1.40,VALENTINE,"Love is your master, for he masters you:"
105593,105594,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.1.41,VALENTINE,"And he that is so yoked by a fool,"
105594,105595,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.1.42,VALENTINE,"Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise."
105595,105596,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.1.43,PROTEUS,"Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud"
105596,105597,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.1.44,PROTEUS,"The eating canker dwells, so eating love"
105597,105598,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.1.45,PROTEUS,Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
105598,105599,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.46,VALENTINE,"And writers say, as the most forward bud"
105599,105600,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.47,VALENTINE,"Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,"
105600,105601,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.48,VALENTINE,Even so by love the young and tender wit
105601,105602,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.49,VALENTINE,"Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,"
105602,105603,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.50,VALENTINE,Losing his verdure even in the prime
105603,105604,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.51,VALENTINE,And all the fair effects of future hopes.
105604,105605,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.52,VALENTINE,"But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,"
105605,105606,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.53,VALENTINE,That art a votary to fond desire?
105606,105607,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.54,VALENTINE,Once more adieu! my father at the road
105607,105608,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.1.55,VALENTINE,"Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd."
105608,105609,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,1.1.56,PROTEUS,"And thither will I bring thee, Valentine."
105609,105610,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.57,VALENTINE,"Sweet Proteus, no, now let us take our leave."
105610,105611,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.58,VALENTINE,To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
105611,105612,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.59,VALENTINE,"Of thy success in love, and what news else"
105612,105613,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.60,VALENTINE,"Betideth here in absence of thy friend,"
105613,105614,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.1.61,VALENTINE,And likewise will visit thee with mine.
105614,105615,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,1.1.62,PROTEUS,All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
105615,105616,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,1.1.63,VALENTINE,"As much to you at home! and so, farewell."
105616,105617,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,,VALENTINE,Exit
105617,105618,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.64,PROTEUS,"He after honour hunts, I after love:"
105618,105619,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.65,PROTEUS,"He leaves his friends to dignify them more,"
105619,105620,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.66,PROTEUS,"I leave myself, my friends and all, for love."
105620,105621,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.67,PROTEUS,"Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,"
105621,105622,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.68,PROTEUS,"Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,"
105622,105623,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.69,PROTEUS,"War with good counsel, set the world at nought,"
105623,105624,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.1.70,PROTEUS,"Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought."
105624,105625,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,,PROTEUS,Enter SPEED
105625,105626,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,1.1.71,SPEED,"Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?"
105626,105627,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,1.1.72,PROTEUS,"But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan."
105627,105628,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,1.1.73,SPEED,"Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,"
105628,105629,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,1.1.74,SPEED,And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
105629,105630,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,1.1.75,PROTEUS,"Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,"
105630,105631,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,1.1.76,PROTEUS,An if the shepherd be a while away.
105631,105632,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,1.1.77,SPEED,"You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,"
105632,105633,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,1.1.78,SPEED,and I a sheep?
105633,105634,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,1.1.79,PROTEUS,I do.
105634,105635,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,1.1.80,SPEED,"Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep."
105635,105636,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.1.81,PROTEUS,A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
105636,105637,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.1.82,SPEED,This proves me still a sheep.
105637,105638,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,1.1.83,PROTEUS,"True, and thy master a shepherd."
105638,105639,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,1.1.84,SPEED,"Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance."
105639,105640,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,1.1.85,PROTEUS,It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
105640,105641,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.1.86,SPEED,"The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the"
105641,105642,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.1.87,SPEED,"shepherd, but I seek my master, and my master seeks"
105642,105643,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.1.88,SPEED,not me: therefore I am no sheep.
105643,105644,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.89,PROTEUS,"The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the"
105644,105645,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.90,PROTEUS,shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
105645,105646,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.91,PROTEUS,"wages followest thy master, thy master for wages"
105646,105647,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.1.92,PROTEUS,follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
105647,105648,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,1.1.93,SPEED,Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
105648,105649,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.1.94,PROTEUS,"But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?"
105649,105650,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.1.95,SPEED,"Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,"
105650,105651,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.1.96,SPEED,"a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a"
105651,105652,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.1.97,SPEED,"lost mutton, nothing for my labour."
105652,105653,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,1.1.98,PROTEUS,Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
105653,105654,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,1.1.99,SPEED,"If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her."
105654,105655,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,1.1.100,PROTEUS,"Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you."
105655,105656,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,1.1.101,SPEED,"Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for"
105656,105657,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,1.1.102,SPEED,carrying your letter.
105657,105658,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,1.1.103,PROTEUS,"You mistake, I mean the pound,--a pinfold."
105658,105659,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.1.104,SPEED,"From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,"
105659,105660,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.1.105,SPEED,'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
105660,105661,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.1.106,SPEED,your lover.
105661,105662,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,1.1.107,PROTEUS,But what said she?
105662,105663,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,1.1.108,SPEED,[First nodding]  Ay.
105663,105664,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,1.1.109,PROTEUS,"Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy."
105664,105665,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.1.110,SPEED,"You mistook, sir, I say, she did nod: and you ask"
105665,105666,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.1.111,SPEED,"me if she did nod, and I say, 'Ay.'"
105666,105667,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,1.1.112,PROTEUS,And that set together is noddy.
105667,105668,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,1.1.113,SPEED,"Now you have taken the pains to set it together,"
105668,105669,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,1.1.114,SPEED,take it for your pains.
105669,105670,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,1.1.115,PROTEUS,"No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter."
105670,105671,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,1.1.116,SPEED,"Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you."
105671,105672,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,1.1.117,PROTEUS,"Why sir, how do you bear with me?"
105672,105673,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,1.1.118,SPEED,"Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing"
105673,105674,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,1.1.119,SPEED,but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
105674,105675,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,1.1.120,PROTEUS,"Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit."
105675,105676,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,1.1.121,SPEED,And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
105676,105677,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,1.1.122,PROTEUS,"Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?"
105677,105678,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,1.1.123,SPEED,"Open your purse, that the money and the matter may"
105678,105679,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,1.1.124,SPEED,be both at once delivered.
105679,105680,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.1.125,PROTEUS,"Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?"
105680,105681,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,1.1.126,SPEED,"Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her."
105681,105682,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,1.1.127,PROTEUS,"Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?"
105682,105683,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.128,SPEED,"Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her, no,"
105683,105684,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.129,SPEED,not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
105684,105685,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.130,SPEED,"and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I"
105685,105686,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.131,SPEED,fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
105686,105687,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.132,SPEED,"mind. Give her no token but stones, for she's as"
105687,105688,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.1.133,SPEED,hard as steel.
105688,105689,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,1.1.134,PROTEUS,What said she? nothing?
105689,105690,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.135,SPEED,"No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To"
105690,105691,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.136,SPEED,"testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned"
105691,105692,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.137,SPEED,"me, in requital whereof, henceforth carry your"
105692,105693,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.1.138,SPEED,"letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master."
105693,105694,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.139,PROTEUS,"Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,"
105694,105695,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.140,PROTEUS,"Which cannot perish having thee aboard,"
105695,105696,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.141,PROTEUS,Being destined to a drier death on shore.
105696,105697,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,Exit SPEED
105697,105698,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.142,PROTEUS,I must go send some better messenger:
105698,105699,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.143,PROTEUS,"I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,"
105699,105700,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.1.144,PROTEUS,Receiving them from such a worthless post.
105700,105701,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
105701,105702,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.
105702,105703,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,,PROTEUS,Enter JULlA and LUCETTA
105703,105704,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.2.1,JULIA,"But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,"
105704,105705,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.2.2,JULIA,Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
105705,105706,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.2.3,LUCETTA,"Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully."
105706,105707,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.2.4,JULIA,Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
105707,105708,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.2.5,JULIA,"That every day with parle encounter me,"
105708,105709,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.2.6,JULIA,In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
105709,105710,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.2.7,LUCETTA,"Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind"
105710,105711,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.2.8,LUCETTA,According to my shallow simple skill.
105711,105712,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.2.9,JULIA,What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
105712,105713,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.2.10,LUCETTA,"As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine,"
105713,105714,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.2.11,LUCETTA,"But, were I you, he never should be mine."
105714,105715,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.2.12,JULIA,What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
105715,105716,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.2.13,LUCETTA,"Well of his wealth, but of himself, so so."
105716,105717,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,1.2.14,JULIA,What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
105717,105718,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,1.2.15,LUCETTA,"Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!"
105718,105719,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,1.2.16,JULIA,How now! what means this passion at his name?
105719,105720,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.2.17,LUCETTA,"Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame"
105720,105721,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.2.18,LUCETTA,"That I, unworthy body as I am,"
105721,105722,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,1.2.19,LUCETTA,Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
105722,105723,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,1.2.20,JULIA,"Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?"
105723,105724,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,1.2.21,LUCETTA,Then thus: of many good I think him best.
105724,105725,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,1.2.22,JULIA,Your reason?
105725,105726,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.2.23,LUCETTA,"I have no other, but a woman's reason,"
105726,105727,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,1.2.24,LUCETTA,I think him so because I think him so.
105727,105728,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,1.2.25,JULIA,And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
105728,105729,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,1.2.26,LUCETTA,"Ay, if you thought your love not cast away."
105729,105730,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.2.27,JULIA,"Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me."
105730,105731,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,1.2.28,LUCETTA,"Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye."
105731,105732,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,1.2.29,JULIA,His little speaking shows his love but small.
105732,105733,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.2.30,LUCETTA,Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
105733,105734,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,1.2.31,JULIA,They do not love that do not show their love.
105734,105735,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,1.2.32,LUCETTA,"O, they love least that let men know their love."
105735,105736,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,1.2.33,JULIA,I would I knew his mind.
105736,105737,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,1.2.34,LUCETTA,"Peruse this paper, madam."
105737,105738,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,1.2.35,JULIA,"'To Julia.' Say, from whom?"
105738,105739,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,1.2.36,LUCETTA,That the contents will show.
105739,105740,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,1.2.37,JULIA,"Say, say, who gave it thee?"
105740,105741,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.38,LUCETTA,"Valentine's page, and sent, I think, from Proteus."
105741,105742,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.39,LUCETTA,"He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,"
105742,105743,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.40,LUCETTA,Did in your name receive it: pardon the
105743,105744,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,1.2.41,LUCETTA,fault I pray.
105744,105745,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.42,JULIA,"Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!"
105745,105746,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.43,JULIA,Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
105746,105747,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.44,JULIA,To whisper and conspire against my youth?
105747,105748,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.45,JULIA,"Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth"
105748,105749,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.46,JULIA,And you an officer fit for the place.
105749,105750,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,1.2.47,JULIA,Or else return no more into my sight.
105750,105751,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,1.2.48,LUCETTA,To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
105751,105752,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,1.2.49,JULIA,Will ye be gone?
105752,105753,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,1.2.50,LUCETTA,That you may ruminate.
105753,105754,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,,LUCETTA,Exit
105754,105755,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.51,JULIA,And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
105755,105756,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.52,JULIA,It were a shame to call her back again
105756,105757,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.53,JULIA,And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
105757,105758,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.54,JULIA,"What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,"
105758,105759,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.55,JULIA,And would not force the letter to my view!
105759,105760,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.56,JULIA,"Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that"
105760,105761,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.57,JULIA,Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
105761,105762,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.58,JULIA,"Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love"
105762,105763,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.59,JULIA,"That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse"
105763,105764,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.60,JULIA,And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
105764,105765,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.61,JULIA,"How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,"
105765,105766,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.62,JULIA,When willingly I would have had her here!
105766,105767,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.63,JULIA,"How angerly I taught my brow to frown,"
105767,105768,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.64,JULIA,When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
105768,105769,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.65,JULIA,My penance is to call Lucetta back
105769,105770,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.66,JULIA,And ask remission for my folly past.
105770,105771,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,1.2.67,JULIA,What ho! Lucetta!
105771,105772,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,JULIA,Re-enter LUCETTA
105772,105773,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,1.2.68,LUCETTA,What would your ladyship?
105773,105774,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,1.2.69,JULIA,Is't near dinner-time?
105774,105775,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.2.70,LUCETTA,"I would it were,"
105775,105776,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.2.71,LUCETTA,That you might kill your stomach on your meat
105776,105777,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,1.2.72,LUCETTA,And not upon your maid.
105777,105778,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,1.2.73,JULIA,What is't that you took up so gingerly?
105778,105779,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,1.2.74,LUCETTA,Nothing.
105779,105780,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,1.2.75,JULIA,"Why didst thou stoop, then?"
105780,105781,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,1.2.76,LUCETTA,To take a paper up that I let fall.
105781,105782,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,1.2.77,JULIA,And is that paper nothing?
105782,105783,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,1.2.78,LUCETTA,Nothing concerning me.
105783,105784,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,1.2.79,JULIA,Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
105784,105785,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,1.2.80,LUCETTA,"Madam, it will not lie where it concerns"
105785,105786,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,1.2.81,LUCETTA,Unless it have a false interpeter.
105786,105787,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,1.2.82,JULIA,Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
105787,105788,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,1.2.83,LUCETTA,"That I might sing it, madam, to a tune."
105788,105789,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,1.2.84,LUCETTA,Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
105789,105790,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.2.85,JULIA,As little by such toys as may be possible.
105790,105791,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,1.2.86,JULIA,Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
105791,105792,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,1.2.87,LUCETTA,It is too heavy for so light a tune.
105792,105793,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,1.2.88,JULIA,Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
105793,105794,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,1.2.89,LUCETTA,"Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it."
105794,105795,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,1.2.90,JULIA,And why not you?
105795,105796,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,1.2.91,LUCETTA,I cannot reach so high.
105796,105797,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,1.2.92,JULIA,"Let's see your song. How now, minion!"
105797,105798,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,1.2.93,LUCETTA,"Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:"
105798,105799,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,1.2.94,LUCETTA,And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
105799,105800,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,1.2.95,JULIA,You do not?
105800,105801,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,1.2.96,LUCETTA,"No, madam, it is too sharp."
105801,105802,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,1.2.97,JULIA,"You, minion, are too saucy."
105802,105803,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.2.98,LUCETTA,"Nay, now you are too flat"
105803,105804,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.2.99,LUCETTA,And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
105804,105805,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,1.2.100,LUCETTA,There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
105805,105806,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,1.2.101,JULIA,The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
105806,105807,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,1.2.102,LUCETTA,"Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus."
105807,105808,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.103,JULIA,This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
105808,105809,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.104,JULIA,Here is a coil with protestation!
105809,105810,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,,JULIA,Tears the letter
105810,105811,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.105,JULIA,"Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:"
105811,105812,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,1.2.106,JULIA,"You would be fingering them, to anger me."
105812,105813,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,1.2.107,LUCETTA,"She makes it strange, but she would be best pleased"
105813,105814,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,1.2.108,LUCETTA,To be so anger'd with another letter.
105814,105815,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,,LUCETTA,Exit
105815,105816,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.109,JULIA,"Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!"
105816,105817,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.110,JULIA,"O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!"
105817,105818,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.111,JULIA,"Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey"
105818,105819,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.112,JULIA,And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
105819,105820,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.113,JULIA,I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
105820,105821,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.114,JULIA,"Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!"
105821,105822,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.115,JULIA,"As in revenge of thy ingratitude,"
105822,105823,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.116,JULIA,"I throw thy name against the bruising stones,"
105823,105824,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.117,JULIA,Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
105824,105825,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.118,JULIA,And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
105825,105826,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.119,JULIA,Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
105826,105827,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.120,JULIA,"Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd,"
105827,105828,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.121,JULIA,And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
105828,105829,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.122,JULIA,But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
105829,105830,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.123,JULIA,"Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away"
105830,105831,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.124,JULIA,"Till I have found each letter in the letter,"
105831,105832,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.125,JULIA,Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
105832,105833,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.126,JULIA,Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
105833,105834,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.127,JULIA,And throw it thence into the raging sea!
105834,105835,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.128,JULIA,"Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,"
105835,105836,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.129,JULIA,"'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,"
105836,105837,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.130,JULIA,To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
105837,105838,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.131,JULIA,"And yet I will not, sith so prettily"
105838,105839,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.132,JULIA,He couples it to his complaining names.
105839,105840,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.133,JULIA,Thus will I fold them one on another:
105840,105841,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,1.2.134,JULIA,"Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will."
105841,105842,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,,JULIA,Re-enter LUCETTA
105842,105843,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.2.135,LUCETTA,"Madam,"
105843,105844,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,1.2.136,LUCETTA,"Dinner is ready, and your father stays."
105844,105845,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,1.2.137,JULIA,"Well, let us go."
105845,105846,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,1.2.138,LUCETTA,"What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?"
105846,105847,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,1.2.139,JULIA,"If you respect them, best to take them up."
105847,105848,Two Gentlemen of Verona,70.0,1.2.140,LUCETTA,"Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:"
105848,105849,Two Gentlemen of Verona,70.0,1.2.141,LUCETTA,"Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold."
105849,105850,Two Gentlemen of Verona,71.0,1.2.142,JULIA,I see you have a month's mind to them.
105850,105851,Two Gentlemen of Verona,72.0,1.2.143,LUCETTA,"Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see,"
105851,105852,Two Gentlemen of Verona,72.0,1.2.144,LUCETTA,"I see things too, although you judge I wink."
105852,105853,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,1.2.145,JULIA,"Come, come, will't please you go?"
105853,105854,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,,JULIA,Exeunt
105854,105855,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,,JULIA,SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.
105855,105856,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,,JULIA,Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
105856,105857,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.3.1,ANTONIO,"Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that"
105857,105858,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,1.3.2,ANTONIO,Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
105858,105859,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,1.3.3,PANTHINO,"'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son."
105859,105860,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,1.3.4,ANTONIO,"Why, what of him?"
105860,105861,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.5,PANTHINO,He wonder'd that your lordship
105861,105862,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.6,PANTHINO,"Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,"
105862,105863,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.7,PANTHINO,"While other men, of slender reputation,"
105863,105864,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.8,PANTHINO,Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
105864,105865,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.9,PANTHINO,"Some to the wars, to try their fortune there,"
105865,105866,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.10,PANTHINO,"Some to discover islands far away,"
105866,105867,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.11,PANTHINO,Some to the studious universities.
105867,105868,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.12,PANTHINO,"For any or for all these exercises,"
105868,105869,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.13,PANTHINO,"He said that Proteus your son was meet,"
105869,105870,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.14,PANTHINO,And did request me to importune you
105870,105871,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.15,PANTHINO,"To let him spend his time no more at home,"
105871,105872,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.16,PANTHINO,"Which would be great impeachment to his age,"
105872,105873,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,1.3.17,PANTHINO,In having known no travel in his youth.
105873,105874,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.18,ANTONIO,Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
105874,105875,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.19,ANTONIO,Whereon this month I have been hammering.
105875,105876,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.20,ANTONIO,I have consider'd well his loss of time
105876,105877,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.21,ANTONIO,"And how he cannot be a perfect man,"
105877,105878,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.22,ANTONIO,Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
105878,105879,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.23,ANTONIO,Experience is by industry achieved
105879,105880,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.24,ANTONIO,And perfected by the swift course of time.
105880,105881,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,1.3.25,ANTONIO,"Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?"
105881,105882,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.3.26,PANTHINO,I think your lordship is not ignorant
105882,105883,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.3.27,PANTHINO,"How his companion, youthful Valentine,"
105883,105884,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,1.3.28,PANTHINO,Attends the emperor in his royal court.
105884,105885,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,1.3.29,ANTONIO,I know it well.
105885,105886,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.30,PANTHINO,"'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:"
105886,105887,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.31,PANTHINO,"There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,"
105887,105888,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.32,PANTHINO,"Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen."
105888,105889,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.33,PANTHINO,And be in eye of every exercise
105889,105890,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,1.3.34,PANTHINO,Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
105890,105891,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,1.3.35,ANTONIO,"I like thy counsel, well hast thou advised:"
105891,105892,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,1.3.36,ANTONIO,"And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,"
105892,105893,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,1.3.37,ANTONIO,The execution of it shall make known.

105918,105919,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,1.3.62,PROTEUS,As one relying on your lordship's will
105919,105920,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,1.3.63,PROTEUS,And not depending on his friendly wish.
105920,105921,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.3.64,ANTONIO,My will is something sorted with his wish.
105921,105922,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.3.65,ANTONIO,"Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed,"
105922,105923,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,1.3.66,ANTONIO,"For what I will, I will, and there an end."

105937,105938,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.80,PROTEUS,"And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd."
105938,105939,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.81,PROTEUS,"I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,"
105939,105940,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.82,PROTEUS,"Lest he should take exceptions to my love,"
105940,105941,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.83,PROTEUS,And with the vantage of mine own excuse
105941,105942,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.84,PROTEUS,Hath he excepted most against my love.
105942,105943,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.85,PROTEUS,"O, how this spring of love resembleth"
105943,105944,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.86,PROTEUS,"The uncertain glory of an April day,"
105944,105945,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.87,PROTEUS,"Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,"
105945,105946,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,1.3.88,PROTEUS,And by and by a cloud takes all away!

105949,105950,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,1.3.91,PROTEUS,"Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,"
105950,105951,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,1.3.92,PROTEUS,And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'

105957,105958,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.1.3,SPEED,"Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one."
105958,105959,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.1.4,VALENTINE,"Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:"
105959,105960,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.1.5,VALENTINE,Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
105960,105961,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.1.6,VALENTINE,"Ah, Silvia, Silvia!"
105961,105962,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.1.7,SPEED,Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
105962,105963,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.1.8,VALENTINE,"How now, sirrah?"
105963,105964,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.1.9,SPEED,"She is not within hearing, sir."
105964,105965,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,2.1.10,VALENTINE,"Why, sir, who bade you call her?"
105965,105966,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.1.11,SPEED,"Your worship, sir, or else I mistook."

105967,105968,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.1.13,SPEED,And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
105968,105969,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,2.1.14,VALENTINE,"Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?"
105969,105970,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.1.15,SPEED,She that your worship loves?
105970,105971,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,2.1.16,VALENTINE,"Why, how know you that I am in love?"
105971,105972,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.17,SPEED,"Marry, by these special marks: first, you have"

105973,105974,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.19,SPEED,"like a malecontent, to relish a love-song, like a"
105974,105975,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.20,SPEED,"robin-redbreast, to walk alone, like one that had"

105977,105978,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.23,SPEED,"buried her grandam, to fast, like one that takes"
105978,105979,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.24,SPEED,"diet, to watch like one that fears robbing, to"
105979,105980,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.25,SPEED,"speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were"

105981,105982,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.27,SPEED,"walked, to walk like one of the lions, when you"
105982,105983,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.28,SPEED,"fasted, it was presently after dinner, when you"
105983,105984,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.29,SPEED,"looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you"
105984,105985,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.30,SPEED,"are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look"
105985,105986,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.1.31,SPEED,"on you, I can hardly think you my master."
105986,105987,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.1.32,VALENTINE,Are all these things perceived in me?
105987,105988,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.1.33,SPEED,They are all perceived without ye.
105988,105989,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,2.1.34,VALENTINE,Without me? they cannot.
105989,105990,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,2.1.35,SPEED,"Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you"
105990,105991,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,2.1.36,SPEED,"were so simple, none else would: but you are so"
105991,105992,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,2.1.37,SPEED,"without these follies, that these follies are within"

105995,105996,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.1.41,VALENTINE,"But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?"
105996,105997,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.1.42,SPEED,She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
105997,105998,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,2.1.43,VALENTINE,"Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean."
105998,105999,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.1.44,SPEED,"Why, sir, I know her not."
105999,106000,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,2.1.45,VALENTINE,"Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet"
106000,106001,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,2.1.46,VALENTINE,knowest her not?
106001,106002,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.1.47,SPEED,"Is she not hard-favoured, sir?"
106002,106003,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,2.1.48,VALENTINE,"Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured."
106003,106004,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,2.1.49,SPEED,"Sir, I know that well enough."
106004,106005,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,2.1.50,VALENTINE,What dost thou know?
106005,106006,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,2.1.51,SPEED,"That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured."
106006,106007,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.1.52,VALENTINE,"I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite."
106007,106008,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,2.1.53,SPEED,That's because the one is painted and the other out
106008,106009,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,2.1.54,SPEED,of all count.
106009,106010,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.1.55,VALENTINE,How painted? and how out of count?
106010,106011,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,2.1.56,SPEED,"Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no"
106011,106012,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,2.1.57,SPEED,man counts of her beauty.
106012,106013,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.1.58,VALENTINE,How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
106013,106014,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,2.1.59,SPEED,You never saw her since she was deformed.
106014,106015,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.1.60,VALENTINE,How long hath she been deformed?
106015,106016,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,2.1.61,SPEED,Ever since you loved her.
106016,106017,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,2.1.62,VALENTINE,"I have loved her ever since I saw her, and still I"
106017,106018,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,2.1.63,VALENTINE,see her beautiful.
106018,106019,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,2.1.64,SPEED,"If you love her, you cannot see her."
106019,106020,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,2.1.65,VALENTINE,Why?
106020,106021,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.1.66,SPEED,"Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes,"
106021,106022,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.1.67,SPEED,or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
106022,106023,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.1.68,SPEED,have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
106023,106024,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.1.69,SPEED,ungartered!
106024,106025,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,2.1.70,VALENTINE,What should I see then?
106025,106026,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.1.71,SPEED,Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
106026,106027,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.1.72,SPEED,"for he, being in love, could not see to garter his"
106027,106028,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.1.73,SPEED,"hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose."
106028,106029,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.1.74,VALENTINE,"Belike, boy, then, you are in love, for last"
106029,106030,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.1.75,VALENTINE,morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
106030,106031,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,2.1.76,SPEED,"True, sir, I was in love with my bed: I thank you,"
106031,106032,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,2.1.77,SPEED,"you swinged me for my love, which makes me the"
106032,106033,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,2.1.78,SPEED,bolder to chide you for yours.
106033,106034,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.1.79,VALENTINE,"In conclusion, I stand affected to her."
106034,106035,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.1.80,SPEED,"I would you were set, so your affection would cease."
106035,106036,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.1.81,VALENTINE,Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
106036,106037,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.1.82,VALENTINE,one she loves.
106037,106038,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,2.1.83,SPEED,And have you?
106038,106039,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,2.1.84,VALENTINE,I have.
106039,106040,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,2.1.85,SPEED,Are they not lamely writ?
106040,106041,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,2.1.86,VALENTINE,"No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!"
106041,106042,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,2.1.87,VALENTINE,here she comes.
106042,106043,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,2.1.88,SPEED,[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
106043,106044,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,2.1.89,SPEED,Now will he interpret to her.

106047,106048,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,2.1.92,SILVIA,"Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand."
106048,106049,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,2.1.93,SPEED,[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.
106049,106050,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,2.1.94,VALENTINE,"As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter"
106050,106051,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,2.1.95,VALENTINE,"Unto the secret nameless friend of yours,"
106051,106052,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,2.1.96,VALENTINE,Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
106052,106053,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,2.1.97,VALENTINE,But for my duty to your ladyship.
106053,106054,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,2.1.98,SILVIA,I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
106054,106055,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.1.99,VALENTINE,"Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off,"
106055,106056,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.1.100,VALENTINE,For being ignorant to whom it goes
106056,106057,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.1.101,VALENTINE,"I writ at random, very doubtfully."
106057,106058,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,2.1.102,SILVIA,Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
106058,106059,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,2.1.103,VALENTINE,"No, madam, so it stead you, I will write"
106059,106060,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,2.1.104,VALENTINE,"Please you command, a thousand times as much, And yet--"
106060,106061,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,2.1.105,SILVIA,"A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel,"
106061,106062,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,2.1.106,SILVIA,"And yet I will not name it, and yet I care not,"
106062,106063,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,2.1.107,SILVIA,"And yet take this again, and yet I thank you,"
106063,106064,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,2.1.108,SILVIA,Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.

106238,106239,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.4.26,THURIO,in your air.
106239,106240,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,2.4.27,VALENTINE,"You have said, sir."
106240,106241,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,2.4.28,THURIO,"Ay, sir, and done too, for this time."
106241,106242,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,2.4.29,VALENTINE,"I know it well, sir, you always end ere you begin."
106242,106243,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,2.4.30,SILVIA,"A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off."
106243,106244,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.4.31,VALENTINE,"'Tis indeed, madam, we thank the giver."
106244,106245,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,2.4.32,SILVIA,"Who is that, servant?"
106245,106246,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.4.33,VALENTINE,"Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir"
106246,106247,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.4.34,VALENTINE,"Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,"
106247,106248,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.4.35,VALENTINE,and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
106248,106249,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,2.4.36,THURIO,"Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall"
106249,106250,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,2.4.37,THURIO,make your wit bankrupt.
106250,106251,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.4.38,VALENTINE,"I know it well, sir, you have an exchequer of words,"
106251,106252,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.4.39,VALENTINE,"and, I think, no other treasure to give your"
106252,106253,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.4.40,VALENTINE,"followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,"
106253,106254,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,2.4.41,VALENTINE,that they live by your bare words.
106254,106255,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,2.4.42,SILVIA,"No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father."
106255,106256,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,SILVIA,Enter DUKE
106256,106257,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.43,DUKE,"Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset."
106257,106258,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.44,DUKE,"Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:"
106258,106259,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.45,DUKE,What say you to a letter from your friends
106259,106260,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,2.4.46,DUKE,Of much good news?
106260,106261,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,2.4.47,VALENTINE,"My lord, I will be thankful."
106261,106262,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,2.4.48,VALENTINE,To any happy messenger from thence.
106262,106263,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,2.4.49,DUKE,"Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?"
106263,106264,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,2.4.50,VALENTINE,"Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman"
106264,106265,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,2.4.51,VALENTINE,To be of worth and worthy estimation
106265,106266,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,2.4.52,VALENTINE,And not without desert so well reputed.
106266,106267,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,2.4.53,DUKE,Hath he not a son?
106267,106268,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.4.54,VALENTINE,"Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves"
106268,106269,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,2.4.55,VALENTINE,The honour and regard of such a father.
106269,106270,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,2.4.56,DUKE,You know him well?
106270,106271,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.57,VALENTINE,"I know him as myself, for from our infancy"
106271,106272,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.58,VALENTINE,We have conversed and spent our hours together:
106272,106273,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.59,VALENTINE,"And though myself have been an idle truant,"
106273,106274,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.60,VALENTINE,Omitting the sweet benefit of time
106274,106275,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.61,VALENTINE,"To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,"
106275,106276,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.62,VALENTINE,"Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,"
106276,106277,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.63,VALENTINE,"Made use and fair advantage of his days,"
106277,106278,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.64,VALENTINE,"His years but young, but his experience old,"
106278,106279,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.65,VALENTINE,"His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe,"
106279,106280,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.66,VALENTINE,"And, in a word, for far behind his worth"
106280,106281,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.67,VALENTINE,"Comes all the praises that I now bestow,"
106281,106282,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.68,VALENTINE,He is complete in feature and in mind
106282,106283,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,2.4.69,VALENTINE,With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
106283,106284,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.70,DUKE,"Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,"
106284,106285,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.71,DUKE,He is as worthy for an empress' love
106285,106286,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.72,DUKE,As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
106286,106287,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.73,DUKE,"Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,"
106287,106288,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.74,DUKE,"With commendation from great potentates,"
106288,106289,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.75,DUKE,And here he means to spend his time awhile:
106289,106290,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,2.4.76,DUKE,I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
106290,106291,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,2.4.77,VALENTINE,"Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he."
106291,106292,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.78,DUKE,Welcome him then according to his worth.
106292,106293,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.79,DUKE,"Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio,"
106293,106294,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.80,DUKE,"For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:"
106294,106295,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,2.4.81,DUKE,I will send him hither to you presently.
106295,106296,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,,DUKE,Exit
106296,106297,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.4.82,VALENTINE,This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
106297,106298,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.4.83,VALENTINE,"Had come along with me, but that his mistress"
106298,106299,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,2.4.84,VALENTINE,Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
106299,106300,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.4.85,SILVIA,Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
106300,106301,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,2.4.86,SILVIA,Upon some other pawn for fealty.
106301,106302,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,2.4.87,VALENTINE,"Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still."
106302,106303,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,2.4.88,SILVIA,"Nay, then he should be blind, and, being blind"
106303,106304,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,2.4.89,SILVIA,How could he see his way to seek out you?
106304,106305,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,2.4.90,VALENTINE,"Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes."
106305,106306,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,2.4.91,THURIO,They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
106306,106307,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,2.4.92,VALENTINE,"To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:"
106307,106308,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,2.4.93,VALENTINE,Upon a homely object Love can wink.
106308,106309,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,2.4.94,SILVIA,"Have done, have done, here comes the gentleman."
106309,106310,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,,SILVIA,Exit THURIO
106310,106311,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,,SILVIA,Enter PROTEUS
106311,106312,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,2.4.95,VALENTINE,"Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,"
106312,106313,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,2.4.96,VALENTINE,Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
106313,106314,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,2.4.97,SILVIA,"His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,"
106314,106315,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,2.4.98,SILVIA,If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
106315,106316,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,2.4.99,VALENTINE,"Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him"
106316,106317,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,2.4.100,VALENTINE,To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
106317,106318,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,2.4.101,SILVIA,Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
106318,106319,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,2.4.102,PROTEUS,"Not so, sweet  lady: but too mean a servant"
106319,106320,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,2.4.103,PROTEUS,To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
106320,106321,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.4.104,VALENTINE,Leave off discourse of disability:
106321,106322,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,2.4.105,VALENTINE,"Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant."
106322,106323,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,2.4.106,PROTEUS,"My duty will I boast of, nothing else."
106323,106324,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,2.4.107,SILVIA,And duty never yet did want his meed:
106324,106325,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,2.4.108,SILVIA,"Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress."
106325,106326,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,2.4.109,PROTEUS,I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
106326,106327,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,2.4.110,SILVIA,That you are welcome?
106327,106328,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,2.4.111,PROTEUS,That you are worthless.
106328,106329,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,,PROTEUS,Re-enter THURIO
106329,106330,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,2.4.112,THURIO,"Madam, my lord your father would speak with you."
106330,106331,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.113,SILVIA,"I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,"
106331,106332,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.114,SILVIA,"Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:"
106332,106333,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.115,SILVIA,"I'll leave you to confer of home affairs,"
106333,106334,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,2.4.116,SILVIA,"When you have done, we look to hear from you."
106334,106335,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,2.4.117,PROTEUS,We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
106335,106336,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,,PROTEUS,Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
106336,106337,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,2.4.118,VALENTINE,"Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?"
106337,106338,Two Gentlemen of Verona,70.0,2.4.119,PROTEUS,Your friends are well and have them much commended.
106338,106339,Two Gentlemen of Verona,71.0,2.4.120,VALENTINE,And how do yours?
106339,106340,Two Gentlemen of Verona,72.0,2.4.121,PROTEUS,I left them all in health.
106340,106341,Two Gentlemen of Verona,73.0,2.4.122,VALENTINE,How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
106341,106342,Two Gentlemen of Verona,74.0,2.4.123,PROTEUS,"My tales of love were wont to weary you,"
106342,106343,Two Gentlemen of Verona,74.0,2.4.124,PROTEUS,I know you joy not in a love discourse.
106343,106344,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.125,VALENTINE,"Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:"
106344,106345,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.126,VALENTINE,"I have done penance for contemning Love,"
106345,106346,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.127,VALENTINE,Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
106346,106347,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.128,VALENTINE,"With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,"
106347,106348,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.129,VALENTINE,"With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs,"
106348,106349,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.130,VALENTINE,"For in revenge of my contempt of love,"
106349,106350,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.131,VALENTINE,Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
106350,106351,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.132,VALENTINE,And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
106351,106352,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.133,VALENTINE,"O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,"
106352,106353,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.134,VALENTINE,"And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,"
106353,106354,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.135,VALENTINE,"There is no woe to his correction,"
106354,106355,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.136,VALENTINE,Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
106355,106356,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.137,VALENTINE,"Now no discourse, except it be of love,"
106356,106357,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.138,VALENTINE,"Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,"
106357,106358,Two Gentlemen of Verona,75.0,2.4.139,VALENTINE,Upon the very naked name of love.
106358,106359,Two Gentlemen of Verona,76.0,2.4.140,PROTEUS,"Enough, I read your fortune in your eye."
106359,106360,Two Gentlemen of Verona,76.0,2.4.141,PROTEUS,Was this the idol that you worship so?
106360,106361,Two Gentlemen of Verona,77.0,2.4.142,VALENTINE,"Even she, and is she not a heavenly saint?"
106361,106362,Two Gentlemen of Verona,78.0,2.4.143,PROTEUS,"No, but she is an earthly paragon."
106362,106363,Two Gentlemen of Verona,79.0,2.4.144,VALENTINE,Call her divine.
106363,106364,Two Gentlemen of Verona,80.0,2.4.145,PROTEUS,I will not flatter her.
106364,106365,Two Gentlemen of Verona,81.0,2.4.146,VALENTINE,"O, flatter me, for love delights in praises."
106365,106366,Two Gentlemen of Verona,82.0,2.4.147,PROTEUS,"When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,"
106366,106367,Two Gentlemen of Verona,82.0,2.4.148,PROTEUS,And I must minister the like to you.
106367,106368,Two Gentlemen of Verona,83.0,2.4.149,VALENTINE,"Then speak the truth by her, if not divine,"
106368,106369,Two Gentlemen of Verona,83.0,2.4.150,VALENTINE,"Yet let her be a principality,"
106369,106370,Two Gentlemen of Verona,83.0,2.4.151,VALENTINE,Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
106370,106371,Two Gentlemen of Verona,84.0,2.4.152,PROTEUS,Except my mistress.
106371,106372,Two Gentlemen of Verona,85.0,2.4.153,VALENTINE,"Sweet, except not any,"
106372,106373,Two Gentlemen of Verona,85.0,2.4.154,VALENTINE,Except thou wilt except against my love.
106373,106374,Two Gentlemen of Verona,86.0,2.4.155,PROTEUS,Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
106374,106375,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.156,VALENTINE,And I will help thee to prefer her too:
106375,106376,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.157,VALENTINE,She shall be dignified with this high honour--
106376,106377,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.158,VALENTINE,"To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth"
106377,106378,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.159,VALENTINE,Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
106378,106379,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.160,VALENTINE,"And, of so great a favour growing proud,"
106379,106380,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.161,VALENTINE,Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
106380,106381,Two Gentlemen of Verona,87.0,2.4.162,VALENTINE,And make rough winter everlastingly.
106381,106382,Two Gentlemen of Verona,88.0,2.4.163,PROTEUS,"Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?"
106382,106383,Two Gentlemen of Verona,89.0,2.4.164,VALENTINE,"Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing"
106383,106384,Two Gentlemen of Verona,89.0,2.4.165,VALENTINE,"To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing,"
106384,106385,Two Gentlemen of Verona,89.0,2.4.166,VALENTINE,She is alone.
106385,106386,Two Gentlemen of Verona,90.0,2.4.167,PROTEUS,Then let her alone.
106386,106387,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.168,VALENTINE,"Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,"
106387,106388,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.169,VALENTINE,And I as rich in having such a jewel
106388,106389,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.170,VALENTINE,"As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,"
106389,106390,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.171,VALENTINE,The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
106390,106391,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.172,VALENTINE,"Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,"
106391,106392,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.173,VALENTINE,Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
106392,106393,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.174,VALENTINE,"My foolish rival, that her father likes"
106393,106394,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.175,VALENTINE,"Only for his possessions are so huge,"
106394,106395,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.176,VALENTINE,"Is gone with her along, and I must after,"
106395,106396,Two Gentlemen of Verona,91.0,2.4.177,VALENTINE,"For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy."
106396,106397,Two Gentlemen of Verona,92.0,2.4.178,PROTEUS,But she loves you?
106397,106398,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.179,VALENTINE,"Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,"
106398,106399,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.180,VALENTINE,"marriage-hour,"
106399,106400,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.181,VALENTINE,"With all the cunning manner of our flight,"
106400,106401,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.182,VALENTINE,"Determined of, how I must climb her window,"
106401,106402,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.183,VALENTINE,"The ladder made of cords, and all the means"
106402,106403,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.184,VALENTINE,Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
106403,106404,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.185,VALENTINE,"Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,"
106404,106405,Two Gentlemen of Verona,93.0,2.4.186,VALENTINE,In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
106405,106406,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.187,PROTEUS,"Go on before, I shall inquire you forth:"
106406,106407,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.188,PROTEUS,"I must unto the road, to disembark"
106407,106408,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.189,PROTEUS,"Some necessaries that I needs must use,"
106408,106409,Two Gentlemen of Verona,94.0,2.4.190,PROTEUS,And then I'll presently attend you.
106409,106410,Two Gentlemen of Verona,95.0,2.4.191,VALENTINE,Will you make haste?
106410,106411,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.192,PROTEUS,I will.
106411,106412,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,Exit VALENTINE
106412,106413,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.193,PROTEUS,"Even as one heat another heat expels,"
106413,106414,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.194,PROTEUS,"Or as one nail by strength drives out another,"
106414,106415,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.195,PROTEUS,So the remembrance of my former love
106415,106416,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.196,PROTEUS,Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
106416,106417,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.197,PROTEUS,"Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,"
106417,106418,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.198,PROTEUS,"Her true perfection, or my false transgression,"
106418,106419,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.199,PROTEUS,That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
106419,106420,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.200,PROTEUS,"She is fair, and so is Julia that I love--"
106420,106421,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.201,PROTEUS,"That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd,"
106421,106422,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.202,PROTEUS,"Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,"
106422,106423,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.203,PROTEUS,Bears no impression of the thing it was.
106423,106424,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.204,PROTEUS,"Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,"
106424,106425,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.205,PROTEUS,And that I love him not as I was wont.
106425,106426,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.206,PROTEUS,"O, but I love his lady too too much,"
106426,106427,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.207,PROTEUS,And that's the reason I love him so little.
106427,106428,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.208,PROTEUS,"How shall I dote on her with more advice,"
106428,106429,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.209,PROTEUS,That thus without advice begin to love her!
106429,106430,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.210,PROTEUS,"'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,"
106430,106431,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.211,PROTEUS,"And that hath dazzled my reason's light,"
106431,106432,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.212,PROTEUS,"But when I look on her perfections,"
106432,106433,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.213,PROTEUS,There is no reason but I shall be blind.
106433,106434,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.214,PROTEUS,"If I can cheque my erring love, I will,"
106434,106435,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,2.4.215,PROTEUS,"If not, to compass her I'll use my skill."
106435,106436,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
106436,106437,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,SCENE V. The same. A street.
106437,106438,Two Gentlemen of Verona,96.0,,PROTEUS,Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
106438,106439,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.5.1,SPEED,"Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!"
106439,106440,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.2,LAUNCE,"Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not"
106440,106441,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.3,LAUNCE,"welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never"
106441,106442,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.4,LAUNCE,"undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a"
106442,106443,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.5,LAUNCE,place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
106443,106444,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.5.6,LAUNCE,say 'Welcome!'
106444,106445,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.7,SPEED,"Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you"
106445,106446,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.8,SPEED,"presently, where, for one shot of five pence, thou"
106446,106447,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.9,SPEED,"shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how"
106447,106448,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.5.10,SPEED,did thy master part with Madam Julia?
106448,106449,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.5.11,LAUNCE,"Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very"
106449,106450,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.5.12,LAUNCE,fairly in jest.
106450,106451,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.5.13,SPEED,But shall she marry him?
106451,106452,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.5.14,LAUNCE,No.
106452,106453,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.5.15,SPEED,How then? shall he marry her?
106453,106454,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,2.5.16,LAUNCE,"No, neither."
106454,106455,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.5.17,SPEED,"What, are they broken?"
106455,106456,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,2.5.18,LAUNCE,"No, they are both as whole as a fish."
106456,106457,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.5.19,SPEED,"Why, then, how stands the matter with them?"
106457,106458,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,2.5.20,LAUNCE,"Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it"
106458,106459,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,2.5.21,LAUNCE,stands well with her.
106459,106460,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.5.22,SPEED,What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
106460,106461,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,2.5.23,LAUNCE,"What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My"
106461,106462,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,2.5.24,LAUNCE,staff understands me.
106462,106463,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.5.25,SPEED,What thou sayest?
106463,106464,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.5.26,LAUNCE,"Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,"
106464,106465,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.5.27,LAUNCE,and my staff understands me.
106465,106466,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.5.28,SPEED,"It stands under thee, indeed."
106466,106467,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,2.5.29,LAUNCE,"Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one."
106467,106468,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,2.5.30,SPEED,"But tell me true, will't be a match?"
106468,106469,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.5.31,LAUNCE,"Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,"
106469,106470,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.5.32,LAUNCE,"it will, if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will."
106470,106471,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.5.33,SPEED,The conclusion is then that it will.
106471,106472,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,2.5.34,LAUNCE,Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
106472,106473,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.5.35,SPEED,"'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest"
106473,106474,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.5.36,SPEED,"thou, that my master is become a notable lover?"
106474,106475,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,2.5.37,LAUNCE,I never knew him otherwise.
106475,106476,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.5.38,SPEED,Than how?
106476,106477,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,2.5.39,LAUNCE,"A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be."
106477,106478,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,2.5.40,SPEED,"Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me."
106478,106479,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,2.5.41,LAUNCE,"Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master."
106479,106480,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,2.5.42,SPEED,"I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover."
106480,106481,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.43,LAUNCE,"Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself"
106481,106482,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.44,LAUNCE,"in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse,"
106482,106483,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.45,LAUNCE,"if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the"
106483,106484,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,2.5.46,LAUNCE,name of a Christian.
106484,106485,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,2.5.47,SPEED,Why?
106485,106486,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.5.48,LAUNCE,Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
106486,106487,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,2.5.49,LAUNCE,go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
106487,106488,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,2.5.50,SPEED,At thy service.
106488,106489,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,SPEED,Exeunt
106489,106490,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,SPEED,SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.
106490,106491,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,SPEED,Enter PROTEUS
106491,106492,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.1,PROTEUS,"To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn,"
106492,106493,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.2,PROTEUS,"To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn,"
106493,106494,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.3,PROTEUS,"To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn,"
106494,106495,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.4,PROTEUS,And even that power which gave me first my oath
106495,106496,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.5,PROTEUS,"Provokes me to this threefold perjury,"
106496,106497,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.6,PROTEUS,Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
106497,106498,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.7,PROTEUS,"O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,"
106498,106499,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.8,PROTEUS,"Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!"
106499,106500,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.9,PROTEUS,"At first I did adore a twinkling star,"
106500,106501,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.10,PROTEUS,But now I worship a celestial sun.
106501,106502,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.11,PROTEUS,"Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,"
106502,106503,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.12,PROTEUS,And he wants wit that wants resolved will
106503,106504,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.13,PROTEUS,To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
106504,106505,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.14,PROTEUS,"Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,"
106505,106506,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.15,PROTEUS,Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
106506,106507,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.16,PROTEUS,With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
106507,106508,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.17,PROTEUS,"I cannot leave to love, and yet I do,"
106508,106509,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.18,PROTEUS,But there I leave to love where I should love.
106509,106510,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.19,PROTEUS,Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
106510,106511,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.20,PROTEUS,"If I keep them, I needs must lose myself,"
106511,106512,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.21,PROTEUS,"If I lose them, thus find I by their loss"
106512,106513,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.22,PROTEUS,"For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia."
106513,106514,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.23,PROTEUS,"I to myself am dearer than a friend,"
106514,106515,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.24,PROTEUS,"For love is still most precious in itself,"
106515,106516,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.25,PROTEUS,"And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--"
106516,106517,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.26,PROTEUS,Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
106517,106518,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.27,PROTEUS,"I will forget that Julia is alive,"
106518,106519,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.28,PROTEUS,"Remembering that my love to her is dead,"
106519,106520,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.29,PROTEUS,"And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,"
106520,106521,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.30,PROTEUS,Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
106521,106522,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.31,PROTEUS,"I cannot now prove constant to myself,"
106522,106523,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.32,PROTEUS,Without some treachery used to Valentine.
106523,106524,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.33,PROTEUS,This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
106524,106525,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.34,PROTEUS,"To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,"
106525,106526,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.35,PROTEUS,"Myself in counsel, his competitor."
106526,106527,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.36,PROTEUS,Now presently I'll give her father notice
106527,106528,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.37,PROTEUS,"Of their disguising and pretended flight,"
106528,106529,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.38,PROTEUS,"Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine,"
106529,106530,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.39,PROTEUS,"For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter,"
106530,106531,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.40,PROTEUS,"But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross"
106531,106532,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.41,PROTEUS,By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
106532,106533,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.42,PROTEUS,"Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,"
106533,106534,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.6.43,PROTEUS,As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
106534,106535,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
106535,106536,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,PROTEUS,SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.
106536,106537,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,PROTEUS,Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
106537,106538,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.1,JULIA,"Counsel, Lucetta, gentle girl, assist me,"
106538,106539,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.2,JULIA,"And even in kind love I do conjure thee,"
106539,106540,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.3,JULIA,Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
106540,106541,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.4,JULIA,"Are visibly character'd and engraved,"
106541,106542,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.5,JULIA,To lesson me and tell me some good mean
106542,106543,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.6,JULIA,"How, with my honour, I may undertake"
106543,106544,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,2.7.7,JULIA,A journey to my loving Proteus.
106544,106545,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,2.7.8,LUCETTA,"Alas, the way is wearisome and long!"
106545,106546,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.9,JULIA,A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
106546,106547,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.10,JULIA,"To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps,"
106547,106548,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.11,JULIA,"Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,"
106548,106549,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.12,JULIA,"And when the flight is made to one so dear,"
106549,106550,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,2.7.13,JULIA,"Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus."
106550,106551,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,2.7.14,LUCETTA,Better forbear till Proteus make return.
106551,106552,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.15,JULIA,"O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?"
106552,106553,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.16,JULIA,"Pity the dearth that I have pined in,"
106553,106554,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.17,JULIA,By longing for that food so long a time.
106554,106555,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.18,JULIA,"Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,"
106555,106556,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.19,JULIA,Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
106556,106557,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,2.7.20,JULIA,As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
106557,106558,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.7.21,LUCETTA,"I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,"
106558,106559,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.7.22,LUCETTA,"But qualify the fire's extreme rage,"
106559,106560,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,2.7.23,LUCETTA,Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
106560,106561,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.24,JULIA,"The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns."
106561,106562,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.25,JULIA,"The current that with gentle murmur glides,"
106562,106563,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.26,JULIA,"Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage,"
106563,106564,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.27,JULIA,"But when his fair course is not hindered,"
106564,106565,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.28,JULIA,"He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,"
106565,106566,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.29,JULIA,Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
106566,106567,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.30,JULIA,"He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,"
106567,106568,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.31,JULIA,And so by many winding nooks he strays
106568,106569,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.32,JULIA,With willing sport to the wild ocean.
106569,106570,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.33,JULIA,Then let me go and hinder not my course
106570,106571,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.34,JULIA,I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
106571,106572,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.35,JULIA,"And make a pastime of each weary step,"
106572,106573,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.36,JULIA,"Till the last step have brought me to my love,"
106573,106574,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.37,JULIA,"And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil"
106574,106575,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,2.7.38,JULIA,A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
106575,106576,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,2.7.39,LUCETTA,But in what habit will you go along?
106576,106577,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.40,JULIA,"Not like a woman, for I would prevent"
106577,106578,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.41,JULIA,The loose encounters of lascivious men:
106578,106579,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.42,JULIA,"Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds"
106579,106580,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,2.7.43,JULIA,As may beseem some well-reputed page.
106580,106581,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,2.7.44,LUCETTA,"Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair."
106581,106582,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.45,JULIA,"No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings"
106582,106583,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.46,JULIA,With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
106583,106584,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.47,JULIA,To be fantastic may become a youth
106584,106585,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,2.7.48,JULIA,Of greater time than I shall show to be.
106585,106586,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,2.7.49,LUCETTA,"What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?"
106586,106587,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.7.50,JULIA,"That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,"
106587,106588,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.7.51,JULIA,What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
106588,106589,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,2.7.52,JULIA,"Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta."
106589,106590,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,2.7.53,LUCETTA,"You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam."
106590,106591,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,2.7.54,JULIA,"Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd."
106591,106592,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.7.55,LUCETTA,"A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,"
106592,106593,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,2.7.56,LUCETTA,Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
106593,106594,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.57,JULIA,"Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have"
106594,106595,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.58,JULIA,What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
106595,106596,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.59,JULIA,"But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me"
106596,106597,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.60,JULIA,For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
106597,106598,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,2.7.61,JULIA,"I fear me, it will make me scandalized."
106598,106599,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,2.7.62,LUCETTA,"If you think so, then stay at home and go not."
106599,106600,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,2.7.63,JULIA,"Nay, that I will not."
106600,106601,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.64,LUCETTA,"Then never dream on infamy, but go."
106601,106602,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.65,LUCETTA,"If Proteus like your journey when you come,"
106602,106603,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.66,LUCETTA,No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
106603,106604,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,2.7.67,LUCETTA,"I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal."
106604,106605,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.68,JULIA,"That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:"
106605,106606,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.69,JULIA,"A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears"
106606,106607,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.70,JULIA,And instances of infinite of love
106607,106608,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,2.7.71,JULIA,Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
106608,106609,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,2.7.72,LUCETTA,All these are servants to deceitful men.
106609,106610,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.73,JULIA,"Base men, that use them to so base effect!"
106610,106611,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.74,JULIA,But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
106611,106612,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.75,JULIA,"His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,"
106612,106613,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.76,JULIA,"His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,"
106613,106614,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.77,JULIA,"His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,"
106614,106615,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,2.7.78,JULIA,His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
106615,106616,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,2.7.79,LUCETTA,"Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!"
106616,106617,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.80,JULIA,"Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong"
106617,106618,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.81,JULIA,To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
106618,106619,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.82,JULIA,"Only deserve my love by loving him,"
106619,106620,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.83,JULIA,"And presently go with me to my chamber,"
106620,106621,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.84,JULIA,"To take a note of what I stand in need of,"
106621,106622,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.85,JULIA,To furnish me upon my longing journey.
106622,106623,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.86,JULIA,"All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,"
106623,106624,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.87,JULIA,"My goods, my lands, my reputation,"
106624,106625,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.88,JULIA,"Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence."
106625,106626,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.89,JULIA,"Come, answer not, but to it presently!"
106626,106627,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,2.7.90,JULIA,I am impatient of my tarriance.
106627,106628,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,Exeunt
106628,106629,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,ACT III
106629,106630,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.
106630,106631,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,,JULIA,"Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS"
106631,106632,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,3.1.1,DUKE,"Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile,"
106632,106633,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,3.1.2,DUKE,We have some secrets to confer about.
106633,106634,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,DUKE,Exit THURIO
106634,106635,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,3.1.3,DUKE,"Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?"
106635,106636,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.4,PROTEUS,"My gracious lord, that which I would discover"
106636,106637,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.5,PROTEUS,"The law of friendship bids me to conceal,"
106637,106638,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.6,PROTEUS,But when I call to mind your gracious favours
106638,106639,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.7,PROTEUS,"Done to me, undeserving as I am,"
106639,106640,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.8,PROTEUS,My duty pricks me on to utter that
106640,106641,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.9,PROTEUS,Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
106641,106642,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.10,PROTEUS,"Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,"
106642,106643,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.11,PROTEUS,This night intends to steal away your daughter:
106643,106644,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.12,PROTEUS,Myself am one made privy to the plot.
106644,106645,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.13,PROTEUS,I know you have determined to bestow her
106645,106646,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.14,PROTEUS,"On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,"
106646,106647,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.15,PROTEUS,"And should she thus be stol'n away from you,"
106647,106648,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.16,PROTEUS,It would be much vexation to your age.
106648,106649,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.17,PROTEUS,"Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose"
106649,106650,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.18,PROTEUS,To cross my friend in his intended drift
106650,106651,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.19,PROTEUS,"Than, by concealing it, heap on your head"
106651,106652,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.20,PROTEUS,"A pack of sorrows which would press you down,"
106652,106653,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,3.1.21,PROTEUS,"Being unprevented, to your timeless grave."
106653,106654,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.22,DUKE,"Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,"
106654,106655,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.23,DUKE,"Which to requite, command me while I live."
106655,106656,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.24,DUKE,"This love of theirs myself have often seen,"
106656,106657,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.25,DUKE,"Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,"
106657,106658,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.26,DUKE,And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
106658,106659,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.27,DUKE,Sir Valentine her company and my court:
106659,106660,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.28,DUKE,But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
106660,106661,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.29,DUKE,"And so unworthily disgrace the man,"
106661,106662,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.30,DUKE,"A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,"
106662,106663,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.31,DUKE,"I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find"
106663,106664,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.32,DUKE,That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
106664,106665,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.33,DUKE,"And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,"
106665,106666,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.34,DUKE,"Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,"
106666,106667,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.35,DUKE,"I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,"
106667,106668,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.36,DUKE,"The key whereof myself have ever kept,"
106668,106669,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,3.1.37,DUKE,And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
106669,106670,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.38,PROTEUS,"Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean"
106670,106671,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.39,PROTEUS,How he her chamber-window will ascend
106671,106672,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.40,PROTEUS,"And with a corded ladder fetch her down,"
106672,106673,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.41,PROTEUS,For which the youthful lover now is gone
106673,106674,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.42,PROTEUS,"And this way comes he with it presently,"
106674,106675,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.43,PROTEUS,"Where, if it please you, you may intercept him."
106675,106676,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.44,PROTEUS,"But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly"
106676,106677,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.45,PROTEUS,"That my discovery be not aimed at,"
106677,106678,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.46,PROTEUS,"For love of you, not hate unto my friend,"
106678,106679,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,3.1.47,PROTEUS,Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
106679,106680,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,3.1.48,DUKE,"Upon mine honour, he shall never know"
106680,106681,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,3.1.49,DUKE,That I had any light from thee of this.
106681,106682,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,3.1.50,PROTEUS,"Adieu, my Lord, Sir Valentine is coming."
106682,106683,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
106683,106684,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,,PROTEUS,Enter VALENTINE
106684,106685,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,3.1.51,DUKE,"Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?"
106685,106686,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,3.1.52,VALENTINE,"Please it your grace, there is a messenger"
106686,106687,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,3.1.53,VALENTINE,"That stays to bear my letters to my friends,"
106687,106688,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,3.1.54,VALENTINE,And I am going to deliver them.
106688,106689,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,3.1.55,DUKE,Be they of much import?
106689,106690,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,3.1.56,VALENTINE,The tenor of them doth but signify
106690,106691,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,3.1.57,VALENTINE,My health and happy being at your court.
106691,106692,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,3.1.58,DUKE,"Nay then, no matter, stay with me awhile,"
106692,106693,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,3.1.59,DUKE,I am to break with thee of some affairs
106693,106694,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,3.1.60,DUKE,"That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret."
106694,106695,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,3.1.61,DUKE,'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
106695,106696,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,3.1.62,DUKE,To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
106696,106697,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,3.1.63,VALENTINE,"I know it well, my Lord, and, sure, the match"
106697,106698,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,3.1.64,VALENTINE,"Were rich and honourable, besides, the gentleman"
106698,106699,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,3.1.65,VALENTINE,"Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities"
106699,106700,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,3.1.66,VALENTINE,Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
106700,106701,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,3.1.67,VALENTINE,Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
106701,106702,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.68,DUKE,"No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,"
106702,106703,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.69,DUKE,"Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,"
106703,106704,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.70,DUKE,Neither regarding that she is my child
106704,106705,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.71,DUKE,"Nor fearing me as if I were her father,"
106705,106706,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.72,DUKE,"And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,"
106706,106707,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.73,DUKE,"Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her,"
106707,106708,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.74,DUKE,"And, where I thought the remnant of mine age"
106708,106709,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.75,DUKE,"Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,"
106709,106710,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.76,DUKE,I now am full resolved to take a wife
106710,106711,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.77,DUKE,And turn her out to who will take her in:
106711,106712,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.78,DUKE,"Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower,"
106712,106713,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.1.79,DUKE,For me and my possessions she esteems not.
106713,106714,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,3.1.80,VALENTINE,What would your Grace have me to do in this?
106714,106715,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.81,DUKE,There is a lady in Verona here
106715,106716,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.82,DUKE,"Whom I affect, but she is nice and coy"
106716,106717,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.83,DUKE,And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
106717,106718,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.84,DUKE,Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
106718,106719,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.85,DUKE,"For long agone I have forgot to court,"
106719,106720,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.86,DUKE,"Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--"
106720,106721,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.87,DUKE,How and which way I may bestow myself
106721,106722,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.1.88,DUKE,To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
106722,106723,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,3.1.89,VALENTINE,"Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:"
106723,106724,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,3.1.90,VALENTINE,Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
106724,106725,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,3.1.91,VALENTINE,More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
106725,106726,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,3.1.92,DUKE,But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
106726,106727,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.93,VALENTINE,A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
106727,106728,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.94,VALENTINE,"Send her another, never give her o'er,"
106728,106729,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.95,VALENTINE,For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
106729,106730,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.96,VALENTINE,"If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,"
106730,106731,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.97,VALENTINE,But rather to beget more love in you:
106731,106732,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.98,VALENTINE,"If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone,"
106732,106733,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.99,VALENTINE,"For why, the fools are mad, if left alone."
106733,106734,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.100,VALENTINE,"Take no repulse, whatever she doth say,"
106734,106735,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.101,VALENTINE,"For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'"
106735,106736,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.102,VALENTINE,"Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces,"
106736,106737,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.103,VALENTINE,"Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces."
106737,106738,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.104,VALENTINE,"That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,"
106738,106739,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.1.105,VALENTINE,If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
106739,106740,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.1.106,DUKE,But she I mean is promised by her friends
106740,106741,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.1.107,DUKE,"Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,"
106741,106742,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.1.108,DUKE,"And kept severely from resort of men,"
106742,106743,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.1.109,DUKE,That no man hath access by day to her.
106743,106744,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.1.110,VALENTINE,"Why, then, I would resort to her by night."
106744,106745,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.1.111,DUKE,"Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,"
106745,106746,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.1.112,DUKE,That no man hath recourse to her by night.
106746,106747,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.1.113,VALENTINE,What lets but one may enter at her window?
106747,106748,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.1.114,DUKE,"Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,"
106748,106749,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.1.115,DUKE,And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
106749,106750,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.1.116,DUKE,Without apparent hazard of his life.
106750,106751,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.1.117,VALENTINE,"Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,"
106751,106752,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.1.118,VALENTINE,"To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,"
106752,106753,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.1.119,VALENTINE,"Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,"
106753,106754,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.1.120,VALENTINE,So bold Leander would adventure it.
106754,106755,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.1.121,DUKE,"Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,"
106755,106756,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.1.122,DUKE,Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
106756,106757,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,3.1.123,VALENTINE,"When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that."
106757,106758,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.1.124,DUKE,"This very night, for Love is like a child,"
106758,106759,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.1.125,DUKE,That longs for every thing that he can come by.
106759,106760,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,3.1.126,VALENTINE,By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
106760,106761,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.1.127,DUKE,"But, hark thee, I will go to her alone:"
106761,106762,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.1.128,DUKE,How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
106762,106763,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,3.1.129,VALENTINE,"It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it"
106763,106764,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,3.1.130,VALENTINE,Under a cloak that is of any length.
106764,106765,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,3.1.131,DUKE,A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
106765,106766,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,3.1.132,VALENTINE,"Ay, my good lord."
106766,106767,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,3.1.133,DUKE,Then let me see thy cloak:
106767,106768,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,3.1.134,DUKE,I'll get me one of such another length.
106768,106769,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,3.1.135,VALENTINE,"Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord."
106769,106770,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.136,DUKE,How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
106770,106771,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.137,DUKE,"I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me."
106771,106772,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.138,DUKE,What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
106772,106773,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.139,DUKE,And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
106773,106774,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.140,DUKE,I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
106774,106775,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,DUKE,Reads
106775,106776,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.141,DUKE,"'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,"
106776,106777,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.142,DUKE,And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
106777,106778,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.143,DUKE,"O, could their master come and go as lightly,"
106778,106779,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.144,DUKE,Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
106779,106780,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.145,DUKE,My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
106780,106781,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.146,DUKE,"While I, their king, that hither them importune,"
106781,106782,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.147,DUKE,"Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,"
106782,106783,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.148,DUKE,Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
106783,106784,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.149,DUKE,"I curse myself, for they are sent by me,"
106784,106785,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.150,DUKE,That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
106785,106786,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.151,DUKE,What's here?
106786,106787,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.152,DUKE,"'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'"
106787,106788,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.153,DUKE,"'Tis so, and here's the ladder for the purpose."
106788,106789,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.154,DUKE,"Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--"
106789,106790,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.155,DUKE,Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
106790,106791,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.156,DUKE,And with thy daring folly burn the world?
106791,106792,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.157,DUKE,"Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?"
106792,106793,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.158,DUKE,"Go, base intruder! overweening slave!"
106793,106794,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.159,DUKE,"Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,"
106794,106795,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.160,DUKE,"And think my patience, more than thy desert,"
106795,106796,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.161,DUKE,Is privilege for thy departure hence:
106796,106797,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.162,DUKE,Thank me for this more than for all the favours
106797,106798,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.163,DUKE,Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
106798,106799,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.164,DUKE,But if thou linger in my territories
106799,106800,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.165,DUKE,Longer than swiftest expedition
106800,106801,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.166,DUKE,"Will give thee time to leave our royal court,"
106801,106802,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.167,DUKE,By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
106802,106803,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.168,DUKE,I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
106803,106804,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.169,DUKE,"Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse,"
106804,106805,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,3.1.170,DUKE,"But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence."
106805,106806,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,DUKE,Exit
106806,106807,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.171,VALENTINE,And why not death rather than living torment?
106807,106808,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.172,VALENTINE,"To die is to be banish'd from myself,"
106808,106809,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.173,VALENTINE,And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
106809,106810,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.174,VALENTINE,Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
106810,106811,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.175,VALENTINE,"What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?"
106811,106812,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.176,VALENTINE,"What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?"
106812,106813,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.177,VALENTINE,Unless it be to think that she is by
106813,106814,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.178,VALENTINE,And feed upon the shadow of perfection
106814,106815,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.179,VALENTINE,"Except I be by Silvia in the night,"
106815,106816,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.180,VALENTINE,"There is no music in the nightingale,"
106816,106817,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.181,VALENTINE,"Unless I look on Silvia in the day,"
106817,106818,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.182,VALENTINE,"There is no day for me to look upon,"
106818,106819,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.183,VALENTINE,"She is my essence, and I leave to be,"
106819,106820,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.184,VALENTINE,If I be not by her fair influence
106820,106821,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.185,VALENTINE,"Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive."
106821,106822,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.186,VALENTINE,"I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:"
106822,106823,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.187,VALENTINE,"Tarry I here, I but attend on death:"
106823,106824,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,3.1.188,VALENTINE,"But, fly I hence, I fly away from life."
106824,106825,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,,VALENTINE,Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
106825,106826,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,3.1.189,PROTEUS,"Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out."
106826,106827,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,3.1.190,LAUNCE,"Soho, soho!"
106827,106828,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,3.1.191,PROTEUS,What seest thou?
106828,106829,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,3.1.192,LAUNCE,Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
106829,106830,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,3.1.193,LAUNCE,but 'tis a Valentine.
106830,106831,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,3.1.194,PROTEUS,Valentine?
106831,106832,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,3.1.195,VALENTINE,No.
106832,106833,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,3.1.196,PROTEUS,Who then? his spirit?
106833,106834,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,3.1.197,VALENTINE,Neither.
106834,106835,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,3.1.198,PROTEUS,What then?
106835,106836,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,3.1.199,VALENTINE,Nothing.
106836,106837,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,3.1.200,LAUNCE,"Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?"
106837,106838,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,3.1.201,PROTEUS,Who wouldst thou strike?
106838,106839,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,3.1.202,LAUNCE,Nothing.
106839,106840,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,3.1.203,PROTEUS,"Villain, forbear."
106840,106841,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,3.1.204,LAUNCE,"Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--"
106841,106842,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,3.1.205,PROTEUS,"Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word."
106842,106843,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,3.1.206,VALENTINE,"My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,"
106843,106844,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,3.1.207,VALENTINE,So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
106844,106845,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,3.1.208,PROTEUS,"Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,"
106845,106846,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,3.1.209,PROTEUS,"For they are harsh, untuneable and bad."
106846,106847,Two Gentlemen of Verona,55.0,3.1.210,VALENTINE,Is Silvia dead?
106847,106848,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,3.1.211,PROTEUS,"No, Valentine."
106848,106849,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,3.1.212,VALENTINE,"No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia."
106849,106850,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,3.1.213,VALENTINE,Hath she forsworn me?
106850,106851,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,3.1.214,PROTEUS,"No, Valentine."
106851,106852,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,3.1.215,VALENTINE,"No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me."
106852,106853,Two Gentlemen of Verona,59.0,3.1.216,VALENTINE,What is your news?
106853,106854,Two Gentlemen of Verona,60.0,3.1.217,LAUNCE,"Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished."
106854,106855,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,3.1.218,PROTEUS,"That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--"
106855,106856,Two Gentlemen of Verona,61.0,3.1.219,PROTEUS,"From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend."
106856,106857,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,3.1.220,VALENTINE,"O, I have fed upon this woe already,"
106857,106858,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,3.1.221,VALENTINE,And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
106858,106859,Two Gentlemen of Verona,62.0,3.1.222,VALENTINE,Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
106859,106860,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.223,PROTEUS,"Ay, ay, and she hath offer'd to the doom--"
106860,106861,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.224,PROTEUS,"Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--"
106861,106862,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.225,PROTEUS,"A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:"
106862,106863,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.226,PROTEUS,"Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd,"
106863,106864,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.227,PROTEUS,"With them, upon her knees, her humble self,"
106864,106865,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.228,PROTEUS,"Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them"
106865,106866,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.229,PROTEUS,As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
106866,106867,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.230,PROTEUS,"But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,"
106867,106868,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.231,PROTEUS,"Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,"
106868,106869,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.232,PROTEUS,"Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire,"
106869,106870,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.233,PROTEUS,"But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die."
106870,106871,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.234,PROTEUS,"Besides, her intercession chafed him so,"
106871,106872,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.235,PROTEUS,"When she for thy repeal was suppliant,"
106872,106873,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.236,PROTEUS,"That to close prison he commanded her,"
106873,106874,Two Gentlemen of Verona,63.0,3.1.237,PROTEUS,With many bitter threats of biding there.
106874,106875,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,3.1.238,VALENTINE,"No more, unless the next word that thou speak'st"
106875,106876,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,3.1.239,VALENTINE,Have some malignant power upon my life:
106876,106877,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,3.1.240,VALENTINE,"If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,"
106877,106878,Two Gentlemen of Verona,64.0,3.1.241,VALENTINE,As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
106878,106879,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.242,PROTEUS,"Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,"
106879,106880,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.243,PROTEUS,And study help for that which thou lament'st.
106880,106881,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.244,PROTEUS,Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
106881,106882,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.245,PROTEUS,"Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love,"
106882,106883,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.246,PROTEUS,"Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life."
106883,106884,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.247,PROTEUS,"Hope is a lover's staff, walk hence with that"
106884,106885,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.248,PROTEUS,And manage it against despairing thoughts.
106885,106886,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.249,PROTEUS,"Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,"
106886,106887,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.250,PROTEUS,"Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd"
106887,106888,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.251,PROTEUS,Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
106888,106889,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.252,PROTEUS,The time now serves not to expostulate:
106889,106890,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.253,PROTEUS,"Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate,"
106890,106891,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.254,PROTEUS,"And, ere I part with thee, confer at large"
106891,106892,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.255,PROTEUS,Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
106892,106893,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.256,PROTEUS,"As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,"
106893,106894,Two Gentlemen of Verona,65.0,3.1.257,PROTEUS,"Regard thy danger, and along with me!"
106894,106895,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,3.1.258,VALENTINE,"I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,"
106895,106896,Two Gentlemen of Verona,66.0,3.1.259,VALENTINE,Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
106896,106897,Two Gentlemen of Verona,67.0,3.1.260,PROTEUS,"Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine."
106897,106898,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,3.1.261,VALENTINE,O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
106898,106899,Two Gentlemen of Verona,68.0,,VALENTINE,Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS
106899,106900,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.262,LAUNCE,"I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to"
106900,106901,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.263,LAUNCE,think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
106901,106902,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.264,LAUNCE,"all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now"
106902,106903,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.265,LAUNCE,"that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a"
106903,106904,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.266,LAUNCE,"team of horse shall not pluck that from me, nor who"
106904,106905,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.267,LAUNCE,"'tis I love, and yet 'tis a woman, but what woman, I"
106905,106906,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.268,LAUNCE,"will not tell myself, and yet 'tis a milkmaid, yet"
106906,106907,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.269,LAUNCE,"'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips, yet 'tis"
106907,106908,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.270,LAUNCE,"a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for"
106908,106909,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.271,LAUNCE,"wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel,"
106909,106910,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.272,LAUNCE,which is much in a bare Christian.
106910,106911,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,,LAUNCE,Pulling out a paper
106911,106912,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.273,LAUNCE,Here is the cate-log of her condition.

106913,106914,Two Gentlemen of Verona,69.0,3.1.275,LAUNCE,"can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only"

107041,107042,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,3.2.25,DUKE,"And also, I think, thou art not ignorant"
107042,107043,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,3.2.26,DUKE,How she opposes her against my will

107044,107045,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.2.28,DUKE,"Ay, and perversely she persevers so."
107045,107046,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.2.29,DUKE,What might we do to make the girl forget
107046,107047,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,3.2.30,DUKE,The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
107047,107048,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,3.2.31,PROTEUS,The best way is to slander Valentine

107049,107050,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,3.2.33,PROTEUS,Three things that women highly hold in hate.
107050,107051,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,3.2.34,DUKE,"Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate."
107051,107052,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,3.2.35,PROTEUS,"Ay, if his enemy deliver it:"
107052,107053,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,3.2.36,PROTEUS,Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
107053,107054,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,3.2.37,PROTEUS,By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
107054,107055,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,3.2.38,DUKE,Then you must undertake to slander him.
107055,107056,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.2.39,PROTEUS,"And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:"
107056,107057,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.2.40,PROTEUS,"'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,"
107057,107058,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,3.2.41,PROTEUS,Especially against his very friend.
107058,107059,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.2.42,DUKE,"Where your good word cannot advantage him,"

107060,107061,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.2.44,DUKE,"Therefore the office is indifferent,"
107061,107062,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,3.2.45,DUKE,Being entreated to it by your friend.
107062,107063,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.46,PROTEUS,"You have prevail'd, my lord, if I can do it"
107063,107064,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.47,PROTEUS,"By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,"
107064,107065,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.48,PROTEUS,She shall not long continue love to him.
107065,107066,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.49,PROTEUS,"But say this weed her love from Valentine,"
107066,107067,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,3.2.50,PROTEUS,It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
107067,107068,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.51,THURIO,"Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,"
107068,107069,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.52,THURIO,"Lest it should ravel and be good to none,"
107069,107070,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.53,THURIO,"You must provide to bottom it on me,"
107070,107071,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.54,THURIO,Which must be done by praising me as much
107071,107072,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,3.2.55,THURIO,As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
107072,107073,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.56,DUKE,"And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,"
107073,107074,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.57,DUKE,"Because we know, on Valentine's report,"
107074,107075,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.58,DUKE,You are already Love's firm votary
107075,107076,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.59,DUKE,And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
107076,107077,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.60,DUKE,Upon this warrant shall you have access
107077,107078,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.61,DUKE,"Where you with Silvia may confer at large,"
107078,107079,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.62,DUKE,"For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,"
107079,107080,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.63,DUKE,"And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you,"
107080,107081,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.64,DUKE,Where you may temper her by your persuasion
107081,107082,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,3.2.65,DUKE,To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
107082,107083,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.66,PROTEUS,"As much as I can do, I will effect:"
107083,107084,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.67,PROTEUS,"But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough,"
107084,107085,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.68,PROTEUS,You must lay lime to tangle her desires
107085,107086,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.69,PROTEUS,"By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes"
107086,107087,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,3.2.70,PROTEUS,Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
107087,107088,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.2.71,DUKE,"Ay,"
107088,107089,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,3.2.72,DUKE,Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
107089,107090,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.73,PROTEUS,Say that upon the altar of her beauty
107090,107091,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.74,PROTEUS,"You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:"
107091,107092,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.75,PROTEUS,"Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears"
107092,107093,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.76,PROTEUS,"Moist it again, and frame some feeling line"
107093,107094,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.77,PROTEUS,That may discover such integrity:
107094,107095,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.78,PROTEUS,"For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,"
107095,107096,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.79,PROTEUS,"Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,"
107096,107097,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.80,PROTEUS,Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
107097,107098,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.81,PROTEUS,Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
107098,107099,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.82,PROTEUS,"After your dire-lamenting elegies,"
107099,107100,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.83,PROTEUS,Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
107100,107101,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.84,PROTEUS,"With some sweet concert, to their instruments"
107101,107102,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.85,PROTEUS,Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
107102,107103,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.86,PROTEUS,Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
107103,107104,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,3.2.87,PROTEUS,"This, or else nothing, will inherit her."
107104,107105,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,3.2.88,DUKE,This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
107105,107106,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.89,THURIO,And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
107106,107107,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.90,THURIO,"Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,"
107107,107108,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.91,THURIO,Let us into the city presently
107108,107109,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.92,THURIO,To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
107109,107110,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.93,THURIO,I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
107110,107111,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,3.2.94,THURIO,To give the onset to thy good advice.
107111,107112,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,3.2.95,DUKE,"About it, gentlemen!"
107112,107113,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.2.96,PROTEUS,"We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,"
107113,107114,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,3.2.97,PROTEUS,And afterward determine our proceedings.
107114,107115,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,3.2.98,DUKE,Even now about it! I will pardon you.
107115,107116,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,,DUKE,Exeunt

107117,107118,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,,DUKE,SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.
107118,107119,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,,DUKE,Enter certain Outlaws
107119,107120,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.1.1,First Outlaw,"Fellows, stand fast, I see a passenger."
107120,107121,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,4.1.2,Second Outlaw,"If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em."
107121,107122,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,,Second Outlaw,Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
107122,107123,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,4.1.3,Third Outlaw,"Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:"
107123,107124,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,4.1.4,Third Outlaw,If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
107124,107125,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.1.5,SPEED,"Sir, we are undone, these are the villains"
107125,107126,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.1.6,SPEED,That all the travellers do fear so much.
107126,107127,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,4.1.7,VALENTINE,"My friends,--"
107127,107128,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,4.1.8,First Outlaw,"That's not so, sir: we are your enemies."
107128,107129,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,4.1.9,Second Outlaw,Peace! we'll hear him.
107129,107130,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,4.1.10,Third Outlaw,"Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man."
107130,107131,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.11,VALENTINE,Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
107131,107132,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.12,VALENTINE,"A man I am cross'd with adversity,"
107132,107133,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.13,VALENTINE,"My riches are these poor habiliments,"
107133,107134,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.14,VALENTINE,"Of which if you should here disfurnish me,"
107134,107135,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.1.15,VALENTINE,You take the sum and substance that I have.
107135,107136,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,4.1.16,Second Outlaw,Whither travel you?
107136,107137,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,4.1.17,VALENTINE,To Verona.
107137,107138,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.1.18,First Outlaw,Whence came you?
107138,107139,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,4.1.19,VALENTINE,From Milan.
107139,107140,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,4.1.20,Third Outlaw,Have you long sojourned there?
107140,107141,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,4.1.21,VALENTINE,"Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,"
107141,107142,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,4.1.22,VALENTINE,If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
107142,107143,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,4.1.23,First Outlaw,"What, were you banish'd thence?"
107143,107144,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.1.24,VALENTINE,I was.
107144,107145,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,4.1.25,Second Outlaw,For what offence?
107145,107146,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.26,VALENTINE,For that which now torments me to rehearse:
107146,107147,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.27,VALENTINE,"I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent,"
107147,107148,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.28,VALENTINE,"Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,"
107148,107149,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.1.29,VALENTINE,Without false vantage or base treachery.
107149,107150,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.1.30,First Outlaw,"Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so."
107150,107151,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.1.31,First Outlaw,But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
107151,107152,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.1.32,VALENTINE,"I was, and held me glad of such a doom."
107152,107153,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,4.1.33,Second Outlaw,Have you the tongues?
107153,107154,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.1.34,VALENTINE,"My youthful travel therein made me happy,"
107154,107155,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.1.35,VALENTINE,Or else I often had been miserable.
107155,107156,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,4.1.36,Third Outlaw,"By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,"
107156,107157,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,4.1.37,Third Outlaw,This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
107157,107158,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,4.1.38,First Outlaw,"We'll have him. Sirs, a word."
107158,107159,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,4.1.39,SPEED,"Master, be one of them, it's an honourable kind of thievery."
107159,107160,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,4.1.40,VALENTINE,"Peace, villain!"
107160,107161,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.1.41,Second Outlaw,Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
107161,107162,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.1.42,VALENTINE,Nothing but my fortune.
107162,107163,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.43,Third Outlaw,"Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,"
107163,107164,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.44,Third Outlaw,Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
107164,107165,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.45,Third Outlaw,Thrust from the company of awful men:
107165,107166,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.46,Third Outlaw,Myself was from Verona banished
107166,107167,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.47,Third Outlaw,"For practising to steal away a lady,"
107167,107168,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.1.48,Third Outlaw,"An heir, and near allied unto the duke."
107168,107169,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,4.1.49,Second Outlaw,"And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,"
107169,107170,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,4.1.50,Second Outlaw,"Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart."
107170,107171,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.51,First Outlaw,"And I for such like petty crimes as these,"
107171,107172,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.52,First Outlaw,"But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,"
107172,107173,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.53,First Outlaw,"That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives,"
107173,107174,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.54,First Outlaw,"And partly, seeing you are beautified"
107174,107175,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.55,First Outlaw,With goodly shape and by your own report
107175,107176,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.56,First Outlaw,A linguist and a man of such perfection
107176,107177,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.1.57,First Outlaw,As we do in our quality much want--
107177,107178,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.58,Second Outlaw,"Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,"
107178,107179,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.59,Second Outlaw,"Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:"
107179,107180,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.60,Second Outlaw,Are you content to be our general?
107180,107181,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.61,Second Outlaw,To make a virtue of necessity
107181,107182,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.1.62,Second Outlaw,"And live, as we do, in this wilderness?"
107182,107183,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.63,Third Outlaw,What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
107183,107184,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.64,Third Outlaw,"Say ay, and be the captain of us all:"
107184,107185,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.65,Third Outlaw,"We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,"
107185,107186,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.1.66,Third Outlaw,Love thee as our commander and our king.
107186,107187,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,4.1.67,First Outlaw,"But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest."
107187,107188,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,4.1.68,Second Outlaw,Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
107188,107189,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.1.69,VALENTINE,"I take your offer and will live with you,"
107189,107190,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.1.70,VALENTINE,Provided that you do no outrages
107190,107191,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.1.71,VALENTINE,On silly women or poor passengers.
107191,107192,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.1.72,Third Outlaw,"No, we detest such vile base practises."
107192,107193,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.1.73,Third Outlaw,"Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,"
107193,107194,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.1.74,Third Outlaw,"And show thee all the treasure we have got,"
107194,107195,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.1.75,Third Outlaw,"Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose."
107195,107196,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,,Third Outlaw,Exeunt
107196,107197,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,,Third Outlaw,"SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber."

107198,107199,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.1,PROTEUS,Already have I been false to Valentine
107199,107200,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.2,PROTEUS,And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
107200,107201,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.3,PROTEUS,"Under the colour of commending him,"
107201,107202,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.4,PROTEUS,I have access my own love to prefer:
107202,107203,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.5,PROTEUS,"But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,"
107203,107204,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.6,PROTEUS,To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
107204,107205,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.7,PROTEUS,"When I protest true loyalty to her,"
107205,107206,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.8,PROTEUS,"She twits me with my falsehood to my friend,"
107206,107207,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.9,PROTEUS,"When to her beauty I commend my vows,"
107207,107208,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.10,PROTEUS,She bids me think how I have been forsworn
107208,107209,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.11,PROTEUS,In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
107209,107210,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.12,PROTEUS,"And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,"
107210,107211,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.13,PROTEUS,"The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,"
107211,107212,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.14,PROTEUS,"Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,"
107212,107213,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.15,PROTEUS,The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
107213,107214,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.16,PROTEUS,"But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,"
107214,107215,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.2.17,PROTEUS,And give some evening music to her ear.

107218,107219,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,4.2.20,PROTEUS,Will creep in service where it cannot go.
107219,107220,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.2.21,THURIO,"Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here."
107220,107221,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,4.2.22,PROTEUS,"Sir, but I do, or else I would be hence."
107221,107222,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,4.2.23,THURIO,Who? Silvia?
107222,107223,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,4.2.24,PROTEUS,"Ay, Silvia, for your sake."
107223,107224,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,4.2.25,THURIO,"I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,"
107224,107225,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,4.2.26,THURIO,"Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile."

107231,107232,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.2.32,JULIA,But shall I hear him speak?
107232,107233,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,4.2.33,Host,"Ay, that you shall."
107233,107234,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,4.2.34,JULIA,That will be music.
107234,107235,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,,JULIA,Music plays

107236,107237,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,4.2.36,JULIA,Is he among these?
107237,107238,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.37,Host,"Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em."
107238,107239,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.38,Host,SONG.
107239,107240,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.39,Host,"Who is Silvia? what is she,"
107240,107241,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.40,Host,That all our swains commend her?
107241,107242,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.41,Host,"Holy, fair and wise is she,"
107242,107243,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.42,Host,"The heaven such grace did lend her,"

107244,107245,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.44,Host,Is she kind as she is fair?

107252,107253,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.2.52,Host,Upon the dull earth dwelling:

107254,107255,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,4.2.54,Host,How now! are you sadder than you were before? How

107263,107264,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,4.2.63,JULIA,"Ay, I would I were deaf, it makes me have a slow heart."

107265,107266,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,4.2.65,JULIA,"Not a whit, when it jars so."

107267,107268,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.2.67,JULIA,"Ay, that change is the spite."
107268,107269,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.2.68,Host,You would have them always play but one thing?
107269,107270,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,4.2.69,JULIA,I would always have one play but one thing.

107288,107289,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,4.2.86,PROTEUS,"One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,"
107289,107290,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,4.2.87,PROTEUS,You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
107290,107291,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.2.88,SILVIA,"Sir Proteus, as I take it."

107297,107298,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.2.95,SILVIA,"Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,"
107298,107299,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.2.96,SILVIA,"To be seduced by thy flattery,"
107299,107300,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.2.97,SILVIA,That hast deceived so many with thy vows?

107312,107313,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,4.2.110,SILVIA,I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
107313,107314,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,4.2.111,SILVIA,To wrong him with thy importunacy?
107314,107315,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,4.2.112,PROTEUS,I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
107315,107316,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,4.2.113,SILVIA,"And so suppose am I, for in his grave"

107317,107318,Two Gentlemen of Verona,53.0,4.2.115,PROTEUS,"Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth."
107318,107319,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,4.2.116,SILVIA,"Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,"
107319,107320,Two Gentlemen of Verona,54.0,4.2.117,SILVIA,"Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine."

107321,107322,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,4.2.119,PROTEUS,"Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,"

107324,107325,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,4.2.122,PROTEUS,"To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:"
107325,107326,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,4.2.123,PROTEUS,For since the substance of your perfect self
107326,107327,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,4.2.124,PROTEUS,"Is else devoted, I am but a shadow,"
107327,107328,Two Gentlemen of Verona,56.0,4.2.125,PROTEUS,And to your shadow will I make true love.
107328,107329,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,4.2.126,JULIA,"[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,"
107329,107330,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,4.2.127,JULIA,"deceive it,"
107330,107331,Two Gentlemen of Verona,57.0,4.2.128,JULIA,"And make it but a shadow, as I am."
107331,107332,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,4.2.129,SILVIA,"I am very loath to be your idol, sir,"
107332,107333,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,4.2.130,SILVIA,But since your falsehood shall become you well
107333,107334,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,4.2.131,SILVIA,"To worship shadows and adore false shapes,"
107334,107335,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,4.2.132,SILVIA,Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
107335,107336,Two Gentlemen of Verona,58.0,4.2.133,SILVIA,"And so, good rest."

107382,107383,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,4.3.33,SILVIA,Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.

107406,107407,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.4,LAUNCE,four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
107407,107408,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.5,LAUNCE,"I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,"
107408,107409,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.6,LAUNCE,'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
107409,107410,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.7,LAUNCE,"him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master,"
107410,107411,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.8,LAUNCE,and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
107411,107412,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.9,LAUNCE,steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
107412,107413,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.10,LAUNCE,"O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself"
107413,107414,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.11,LAUNCE,"in all companies! I would have, as one should say,"
107414,107415,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.12,LAUNCE,"one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,"
107415,107416,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.13,LAUNCE,"as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had"
107416,107417,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.14,LAUNCE,"more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,"
107417,107418,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.15,LAUNCE,"I think verily he had been hanged for't, sure as I"
107418,107419,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.16,LAUNCE,"live, he had suffered for't, you shall judge. He"
107419,107420,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.17,LAUNCE,thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
107420,107421,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.18,LAUNCE,gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
107421,107422,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.19,LAUNCE,"not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but"
107422,107423,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.20,LAUNCE,all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
107423,107424,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.21,LAUNCE,one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
107424,107425,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.22,LAUNCE,out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
107425,107426,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.23,LAUNCE,"I, having been acquainted with the smell before,"
107426,107427,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.24,LAUNCE,"knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that"
107427,107428,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.25,LAUNCE,"whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip"
107428,107429,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.26,LAUNCE,"the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him"
107429,107430,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.27,LAUNCE,"the more wrong,' quoth I, ''twas I did the thing you"

107431,107432,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.29,LAUNCE,of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
107432,107433,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.30,LAUNCE,"his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the"
107433,107434,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.31,LAUNCE,"stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had"
107434,107435,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.32,LAUNCE,"been executed, I have stood on the pillory for geese"
107435,107436,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.33,LAUNCE,"he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't."
107436,107437,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.34,LAUNCE,"Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the"
107437,107438,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.35,LAUNCE,trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
107438,107439,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.36,LAUNCE,Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
107439,107440,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.37,LAUNCE,do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
107440,107441,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.38,LAUNCE,water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
107441,107442,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,4.4.39,LAUNCE,thou ever see me do such a trick?
107442,107443,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,LAUNCE,Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
107443,107444,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,4.4.40,PROTEUS,Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
107444,107445,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,4.4.41,PROTEUS,And will employ thee in some service presently.
107445,107446,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,4.4.42,JULIA,In what you please: I'll do what I can.
107446,107447,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.4.43,PROTEUS,I hope thou wilt.
107447,107448,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,,PROTEUS,To LAUNCE
107448,107449,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.4.44,PROTEUS,"How now, you whoreson peasant!"
107449,107450,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,4.4.45,PROTEUS,Where have you been these two days loitering?
107450,107451,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,4.4.46,LAUNCE,"Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me."
107451,107452,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,4.4.47,PROTEUS,And what says she to my little jewel?
107452,107453,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,4.4.48,LAUNCE,"Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you"
107453,107454,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,4.4.49,LAUNCE,currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
107454,107455,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,4.4.50,PROTEUS,But she received my dog?
107455,107456,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.4.51,LAUNCE,"No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him"
107456,107457,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,4.4.52,LAUNCE,back again.
107457,107458,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,4.4.53,PROTEUS,"What, didst thou offer her this from me?"
107458,107459,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,4.4.54,LAUNCE,"Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by"
107459,107460,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,4.4.55,LAUNCE,the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
107460,107461,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,4.4.56,LAUNCE,"offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of"
107461,107462,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,4.4.57,LAUNCE,"yours, and therefore the gift the greater."
107462,107463,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.58,PROTEUS,"Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,"
107463,107464,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.59,PROTEUS,Or ne'er return again into my sight.
107464,107465,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.60,PROTEUS,"Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?"
107465,107466,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,,PROTEUS,Exit LAUNCE
107466,107467,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.61,PROTEUS,"A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!"
107467,107468,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.62,PROTEUS,"Sebastian, I have entertained thee,"
107468,107469,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.63,PROTEUS,Partly that I have need of such a youth
107469,107470,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.64,PROTEUS,"That can with some discretion do my business,"
107470,107471,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.65,PROTEUS,"For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,"
107471,107472,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.66,PROTEUS,"But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,"
107472,107473,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.67,PROTEUS,"Which, if my augury deceive me not,"
107473,107474,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.68,PROTEUS,"Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:"
107474,107475,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.69,PROTEUS,"Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee."
107475,107476,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.70,PROTEUS,"Go presently and take this ring with thee,"
107476,107477,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.71,PROTEUS,Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
107477,107478,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,4.4.72,PROTEUS,She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
107478,107479,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,4.4.73,JULIA,"It seems you loved not her, to leave her token."
107479,107480,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,4.4.74,JULIA,"She is dead, belike?"
107480,107481,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,4.4.75,PROTEUS,"Not so, I think she lives."
107481,107482,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,4.4.76,JULIA,Alas!
107482,107483,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,4.4.77,PROTEUS,Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
107483,107484,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.4.78,JULIA,I cannot choose
107484,107485,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,4.4.79,JULIA,But pity her.
107485,107486,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,4.4.80,PROTEUS,Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
107486,107487,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.81,JULIA,Because methinks that she loved you as well
107487,107488,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.82,JULIA,As you do love your lady Silvia:
107488,107489,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.83,JULIA,"She dreams of him that has forgot her love,"
107489,107490,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.84,JULIA,You dote on her that cares not for your love.
107490,107491,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.85,JULIA,"'Tis pity love should be so contrary,"
107491,107492,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,4.4.86,JULIA,And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
107492,107493,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.87,PROTEUS,"Well, give her that ring and therewithal"
107493,107494,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.88,PROTEUS,This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
107494,107495,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.89,PROTEUS,I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
107495,107496,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.90,PROTEUS,"Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,"
107496,107497,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,4.4.91,PROTEUS,"Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary."
107497,107498,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
107498,107499,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.92,JULIA,How many women would do such a message?
107499,107500,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.93,JULIA,"Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd"
107500,107501,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.94,JULIA,A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
107501,107502,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.95,JULIA,"Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him"
107502,107503,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.96,JULIA,That with his very heart despiseth me?
107503,107504,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.97,JULIA,"Because he loves her, he despiseth me,"
107504,107505,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.98,JULIA,Because I love him I must pity him.
107505,107506,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.99,JULIA,"This ring I gave him when he parted from me,"
107506,107507,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.100,JULIA,"To bind him to remember my good will,"
107507,107508,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.101,JULIA,"And now am I, unhappy messenger,"
107508,107509,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.102,JULIA,"To plead for that which I would not obtain,"
107509,107510,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.103,JULIA,"To carry that which I would have refused,"
107510,107511,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.104,JULIA,To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
107511,107512,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.105,JULIA,"I am my master's true-confirmed love,"
107512,107513,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.106,JULIA,"But cannot be true servant to my master,"
107513,107514,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.107,JULIA,Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
107514,107515,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.108,JULIA,"Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly"
107515,107516,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.109,JULIA,"As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed."
107516,107517,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,,JULIA,"Enter SILVIA, attended"
107517,107518,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.110,JULIA,"Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean"
107518,107519,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,4.4.111,JULIA,To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
107519,107520,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,4.4.112,SILVIA,"What would you with her, if that I be she?"
107520,107521,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.4.113,JULIA,"If you be she, I do entreat your patience"
107521,107522,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,4.4.114,JULIA,To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
107522,107523,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,4.4.115,SILVIA,From whom?
107523,107524,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,4.4.116,JULIA,"From my master, Sir Proteus, madam."
107524,107525,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,4.4.117,SILVIA,"O, he sends you for a picture."
107525,107526,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,4.4.118,JULIA,"Ay, madam."
107526,107527,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.119,SILVIA,"Ursula, bring my picture here."
107527,107528,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.120,SILVIA,"Go give your master this: tell him from me,"
107528,107529,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.121,SILVIA,"One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,"
107529,107530,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,4.4.122,SILVIA,Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
107530,107531,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.123,JULIA,"Madam, please you peruse this letter.--"
107531,107532,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.124,JULIA,"Pardon me, madam, I have unadvised"
107532,107533,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.125,JULIA,Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
107533,107534,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,4.4.126,JULIA,This is the letter to your ladyship.
107534,107535,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,4.4.127,SILVIA,"I pray thee, let me look on that again."
107535,107536,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,4.4.128,JULIA,"It may not be, good madam, pardon me."
107536,107537,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.129,SILVIA,"There, hold!"
107537,107538,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.130,SILVIA,I will not look upon your master's lines:
107538,107539,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.131,SILVIA,I know they are stuff'd with protestations
107539,107540,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.132,SILVIA,"And full of new-found oaths, which he will break"
107540,107541,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,4.4.133,SILVIA,As easily as I do tear his paper.
107541,107542,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,4.4.134,JULIA,"Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring."
107542,107543,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.135,SILVIA,"The more shame for him that he sends it me,"
107543,107544,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.136,SILVIA,For I have heard him say a thousand times
107544,107545,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.137,SILVIA,His Julia gave it him at his departure.
107545,107546,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.138,SILVIA,"Though his false finger have profaned the ring,"
107546,107547,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,4.4.139,SILVIA,Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
107547,107548,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,4.4.140,JULIA,She thanks you.
107548,107549,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,4.4.141,SILVIA,What say'st thou?
107549,107550,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.4.142,JULIA,"I thank you, madam, that you tender her."
107550,107551,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,4.4.143,JULIA,Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
107551,107552,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,4.4.144,SILVIA,Dost thou know her?
107552,107553,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,4.4.145,JULIA,Almost as well as I do know myself:
107553,107554,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,4.4.146,JULIA,To think upon her woes I do protest
107554,107555,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,4.4.147,JULIA,That I have wept a hundred several times.
107555,107556,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,4.4.148,SILVIA,Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
107556,107557,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,4.4.149,JULIA,"I think she doth, and that's her cause of sorrow."
107557,107558,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,4.4.150,SILVIA,Is she not passing fair?
107558,107559,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.151,JULIA,"She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:"
107559,107560,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.152,JULIA,"When she did think my master loved her well,"
107560,107561,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.153,JULIA,"She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:"
107561,107562,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.154,JULIA,But since she did neglect her looking-glass
107562,107563,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.155,JULIA,"And threw her sun-expelling mask away,"
107563,107564,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.156,JULIA,The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
107564,107565,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.157,JULIA,"And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,"
107565,107566,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,4.4.158,JULIA,That now she is become as black as I.
107566,107567,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,4.4.159,SILVIA,How tall was she?
107567,107568,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.160,JULIA,"About my stature, for at Pentecost,"
107568,107569,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.161,JULIA,"When all our pageants of delight were play'd,"
107569,107570,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.162,JULIA,"Our youth got me to play the woman's part,"
107570,107571,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.163,JULIA,"And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,"
107571,107572,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.164,JULIA,"Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,"
107572,107573,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.165,JULIA,As if the garment had been made for me:
107573,107574,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.166,JULIA,Therefore I know she is about my height.
107574,107575,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.167,JULIA,"And at that time I made her weep agood,"
107575,107576,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.168,JULIA,For I did play a lamentable part:
107576,107577,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.169,JULIA,"Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning"
107577,107578,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.170,JULIA,"For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight,"
107578,107579,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.171,JULIA,Which I so lively acted with my tears
107579,107580,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.172,JULIA,"That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,"
107580,107581,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.173,JULIA,"Wept bitterly, and would I might be dead"
107581,107582,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,4.4.174,JULIA,If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
107582,107583,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.175,SILVIA,"She is beholding to thee, gentle youth."
107583,107584,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.176,SILVIA,"Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!"
107584,107585,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.177,SILVIA,I weep myself to think upon thy words.
107585,107586,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.178,SILVIA,"Here, youth, there is my purse, I give thee this"
107586,107587,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.179,SILVIA,"For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her."
107587,107588,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,4.4.180,SILVIA,Farewell.
107588,107589,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,,SILVIA,"Exit SILVIA, with attendants"
107589,107590,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.181,JULIA,"And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her."
107590,107591,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.182,JULIA,"A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful"
107591,107592,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.183,JULIA,"I hope my master's suit will be but cold,"
107592,107593,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.184,JULIA,Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
107593,107594,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.185,JULIA,"Alas, how love can trifle with itself!"
107594,107595,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.186,JULIA,"Here is her picture: let me see, I think,"
107595,107596,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.187,JULIA,"If I had such a tire, this face of mine"
107596,107597,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.188,JULIA,Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
107597,107598,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.189,JULIA,"And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,"
107598,107599,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.190,JULIA,Unless I flatter with myself too much.
107599,107600,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.191,JULIA,"Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:"
107600,107601,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.192,JULIA,"If that be all the difference in his love,"
107601,107602,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.193,JULIA,I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
107602,107603,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.194,JULIA,"Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:"
107603,107604,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.195,JULIA,"Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high."
107604,107605,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.196,JULIA,What should it be that he respects in her
107605,107606,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.197,JULIA,"But I can make respective in myself,"
107606,107607,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.198,JULIA,If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
107607,107608,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.199,JULIA,"Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,"
107608,107609,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.200,JULIA,"For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,"
107609,107610,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.201,JULIA,"Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!"
107610,107611,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.202,JULIA,"And, were there sense in his idolatry,"
107611,107612,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.203,JULIA,My substance should be statue in thy stead.
107612,107613,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.204,JULIA,"I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,"
107613,107614,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.205,JULIA,"That used me so, or else, by Jove I vow,"
107614,107615,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.206,JULIA,I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
107615,107616,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,4.4.207,JULIA,To make my master out of love with thee!
107616,107617,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,,JULIA,Exit

107620,107621,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.1,EGLAMOUR,"The sun begins to gild the western sky,"
107621,107622,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.2,EGLAMOUR,And now it is about the very hour
107622,107623,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.3,EGLAMOUR,"That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me."
107623,107624,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.4,EGLAMOUR,"She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,"
107624,107625,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.5,EGLAMOUR,"Unless it be to come before their time,"
107625,107626,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.6,EGLAMOUR,So much they spur their expedition.
107626,107627,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.7,EGLAMOUR,See where she comes.
107627,107628,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,EGLAMOUR,Enter SILVIA
107628,107629,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.1.8,EGLAMOUR,"Lady, a happy evening!"
107629,107630,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.1.9,SILVIA,"Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,"
107630,107631,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.1.10,SILVIA,Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
107631,107632,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.1.11,SILVIA,I fear I am attended by some spies.
107632,107633,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.1.12,EGLAMOUR,"Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off,"
107633,107634,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.1.13,EGLAMOUR,"If we recover that, we are sure enough."
107634,107635,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,,EGLAMOUR,Exeunt
107635,107636,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,,EGLAMOUR,SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.
107636,107637,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,,EGLAMOUR,"Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA"
107637,107638,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.2.1,THURIO,"Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?"
107638,107639,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.2.2,PROTEUS,"O, sir, I find her milder than she was,"
107639,107640,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.2.3,PROTEUS,And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
107640,107641,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.2.4,THURIO,"What, that my leg is too long?"
107641,107642,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,5.2.5,PROTEUS,"No, that it is too little."
107642,107643,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.2.6,THURIO,"I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder."
107643,107644,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.2.7,JULIA,[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what
107644,107645,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.2.8,JULIA,it loathes.
107645,107646,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,5.2.9,THURIO,What says she to my face?
107646,107647,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.2.10,PROTEUS,She says it is a fair one.
107647,107648,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.2.11,THURIO,"Nay then, the wanton lies, my face is black."
107648,107649,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.2.12,PROTEUS,"But pearls are fair, and the old saying is,"
107649,107650,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.2.13,PROTEUS,Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
107650,107651,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.2.14,JULIA,"[Aside]  'Tis true, such pearls as put out"
107651,107652,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.2.15,JULIA,"ladies' eyes,"
107652,107653,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.2.16,JULIA,For I had rather wink than look on them.
107653,107654,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,5.2.17,THURIO,How likes she my discourse?
107654,107655,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.2.18,PROTEUS,"Ill, when you talk of war."
107655,107656,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,5.2.19,THURIO,"But well, when I discourse of love and peace?"
107656,107657,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,5.2.20,JULIA,"[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace."
107657,107658,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,5.2.21,THURIO,What says she to my valour?
107658,107659,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,5.2.22,PROTEUS,"O, sir, she makes no doubt of that."
107659,107660,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.2.23,JULIA,"[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice."
107660,107661,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.2.24,THURIO,What says she to my birth?
107661,107662,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.2.25,PROTEUS,That you are well derived.
107662,107663,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,5.2.26,JULIA,"[Aside]  True, from a gentleman to a fool."
107663,107664,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,5.2.27,THURIO,Considers she my possessions?
107664,107665,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,5.2.28,PROTEUS,"O, ay, and pities them."
107665,107666,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,5.2.29,THURIO,Wherefore?
107666,107667,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,5.2.30,JULIA,[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
107667,107668,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,5.2.31,PROTEUS,That they are out by lease.
107668,107669,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,5.2.32,JULIA,Here comes the duke.
107669,107670,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,,JULIA,Enter DUKE
107670,107671,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.2.33,DUKE,"How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!"
107671,107672,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.2.34,DUKE,Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
107672,107673,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,5.2.35,THURIO,Not I.
107673,107674,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,5.2.36,PROTEUS,Nor I.
107674,107675,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,5.2.37,DUKE,Saw you my daughter?
107675,107676,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.2.38,PROTEUS,Neither.
107676,107677,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.39,DUKE,"Why then,"
107677,107678,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.40,DUKE,"She's fled unto that peasant Valentine,"
107678,107679,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.41,DUKE,And Eglamour is in her company.
107679,107680,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.42,DUKE,"'Tis true, for Friar Laurence met them both,"
107680,107681,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.43,DUKE,"As he in penance wander'd through the forest,"
107681,107682,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.44,DUKE,"Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,"
107682,107683,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.45,DUKE,"But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it,"
107683,107684,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.46,DUKE,"Besides, she did intend confession"
107684,107685,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.47,DUKE,"At Patrick's cell this even, and there she was not,"
107685,107686,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.48,DUKE,These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
107686,107687,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.49,DUKE,"Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,"
107687,107688,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.50,DUKE,But mount you presently and meet with me
107688,107689,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.51,DUKE,Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
107689,107690,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.52,DUKE,"That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:"
107690,107691,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.2.53,DUKE,"Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me."
107691,107692,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,,DUKE,Exit
107692,107693,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.54,THURIO,"Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,"
107693,107694,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.55,THURIO,That flies her fortune when it follows her.
107694,107695,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.56,THURIO,"I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour"
107695,107696,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.2.57,THURIO,Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
107696,107697,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,,THURIO,Exit
107697,107698,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,5.2.58,PROTEUS,"And I will follow, more for Silvia's love"
107698,107699,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,5.2.59,PROTEUS,Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
107699,107700,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,,PROTEUS,Exit
107700,107701,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,5.2.60,JULIA,"And I will follow, more to cross that love"
107701,107702,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,5.2.61,JULIA,Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
107702,107703,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,,JULIA,Exit
107703,107704,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,,JULIA,SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.
107704,107705,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,,JULIA,Enter Outlaws with SILVIA
107705,107706,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.3.1,First Outlaw,"Come, come,"
107706,107707,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.3.2,First Outlaw,"Be patient, we must bring you to our captain."
107707,107708,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.3.3,SILVIA,A thousand more mischances than this one
107708,107709,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.3.4,SILVIA,Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
107709,107710,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.3.5,Second Outlaw,"Come, bring her away."
107710,107711,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,5.3.6,First Outlaw,Where is the gentleman that was with her?
107711,107712,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.7,Third Outlaw,"Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,"
107712,107713,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.8,Third Outlaw,But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
107713,107714,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.9,Third Outlaw,"Go thou with her to the west end of the wood,"
107714,107715,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.10,Third Outlaw,"There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled,"
107715,107716,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.3.11,Third Outlaw,"The thicket is beset, he cannot 'scape."
107716,107717,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.3.12,First Outlaw,"Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:"
107717,107718,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.3.13,First Outlaw,"Fear not, he bears an honourable mind,"
107718,107719,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.3.14,First Outlaw,And will not use a woman lawlessly.
107719,107720,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,5.3.15,SILVIA,"O Valentine, this I endure for thee!"
107720,107721,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,,SILVIA,Exeunt
107721,107722,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,,SILVIA,SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.

107723,107724,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.1,VALENTINE,How use doth breed a habit in a man!
107724,107725,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.2,VALENTINE,"This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,"
107725,107726,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.3,VALENTINE,I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
107726,107727,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.4,VALENTINE,"Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,"
107727,107728,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.5,VALENTINE,And to the nightingale's complaining notes
107728,107729,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.6,VALENTINE,Tune my distresses and record my woes.
107729,107730,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.7,VALENTINE,"O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,"
107730,107731,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.8,VALENTINE,"Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,"
107731,107732,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.9,VALENTINE,"Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall"
107732,107733,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.10,VALENTINE,And leave no memory of what it was!
107733,107734,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.11,VALENTINE,"Repair me with thy presence, Silvia,"
107734,107735,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.12,VALENTINE,"Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!"
107735,107736,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.13,VALENTINE,What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
107736,107737,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.14,VALENTINE,"These are my mates, that make their wills their law,"
107737,107738,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.15,VALENTINE,Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
107738,107739,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.16,VALENTINE,"They love me well, yet I have much to do"
107739,107740,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.17,VALENTINE,To keep them from uncivil outrages.
107740,107741,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,5.4.18,VALENTINE,"Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?"
107741,107742,Two Gentlemen of Verona,1.0,,VALENTINE,"Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA"
107742,107743,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.19,PROTEUS,"Madam, this service I have done for you,"
107743,107744,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.20,PROTEUS,"Though you respect not aught your servant doth,"
107744,107745,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.21,PROTEUS,To hazard life and rescue you from him
107745,107746,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.22,PROTEUS,"That would have forced your honour and your love,"
107746,107747,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.23,PROTEUS,"Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look,"
107747,107748,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.24,PROTEUS,A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
107748,107749,Two Gentlemen of Verona,2.0,5.4.25,PROTEUS,"And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give."
107749,107750,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.4.26,VALENTINE,[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
107750,107751,Two Gentlemen of Verona,3.0,5.4.27,VALENTINE,"Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile."
107751,107752,Two Gentlemen of Verona,4.0,5.4.28,SILVIA,"O miserable, unhappy that I am!"
107752,107753,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.4.29,PROTEUS,"Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came,"
107753,107754,Two Gentlemen of Verona,5.0,5.4.30,PROTEUS,But by my coming I have made you happy.
107754,107755,Two Gentlemen of Verona,6.0,5.4.31,SILVIA,By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
107755,107756,Two Gentlemen of Verona,7.0,5.4.32,JULIA,"[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence."
107756,107757,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.33,SILVIA,"Had I been seized by a hungry lion,"
107757,107758,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.34,SILVIA,"I would have been a breakfast to the beast,"
107758,107759,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.35,SILVIA,Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
107759,107760,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.36,SILVIA,"O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,"
107760,107761,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.37,SILVIA,Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
107761,107762,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.38,SILVIA,"And full as much, for more there cannot be,"
107762,107763,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.39,SILVIA,I do detest false perjured Proteus.
107763,107764,Two Gentlemen of Verona,8.0,5.4.40,SILVIA,"Therefore be gone, solicit me no more."
107764,107765,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.41,PROTEUS,"What dangerous action, stood it next to death,"
107765,107766,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.42,PROTEUS,Would I not undergo for one calm look!
107766,107767,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.43,PROTEUS,"O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,"
107767,107768,Two Gentlemen of Verona,9.0,5.4.44,PROTEUS,When women cannot love where they're beloved!
107768,107769,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.45,SILVIA,When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
107769,107770,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.46,SILVIA,"Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,"
107770,107771,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.47,SILVIA,For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
107771,107772,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.48,SILVIA,"Into a thousand oaths, and all those oaths"
107772,107773,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.49,SILVIA,"Descended into perjury, to love me."
107773,107774,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.50,SILVIA,"Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two,"
107774,107775,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.51,SILVIA,"And that's far worse than none, better have none"
107775,107776,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.52,SILVIA,Than plural faith which is too much by one:
107776,107777,Two Gentlemen of Verona,10.0,5.4.53,SILVIA,Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
107777,107778,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.4.54,PROTEUS,In love
107778,107779,Two Gentlemen of Verona,11.0,5.4.55,PROTEUS,Who respects friend?
107779,107780,Two Gentlemen of Verona,12.0,5.4.56,SILVIA,All men but Proteus.
107780,107781,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.57,PROTEUS,"Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words"
107781,107782,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.58,PROTEUS,"Can no way change you to a milder form,"
107782,107783,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.59,PROTEUS,"I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,"
107783,107784,Two Gentlemen of Verona,13.0,5.4.60,PROTEUS,"And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye."
107784,107785,Two Gentlemen of Verona,14.0,5.4.61,SILVIA,O heaven!
107785,107786,Two Gentlemen of Verona,15.0,5.4.62,PROTEUS,I'll force thee yield to my desire.
107786,107787,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,5.4.63,VALENTINE,"Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,"
107787,107788,Two Gentlemen of Verona,16.0,5.4.64,VALENTINE,Thou friend of an ill fashion!
107788,107789,Two Gentlemen of Verona,17.0,5.4.65,PROTEUS,Valentine!
107789,107790,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.66,VALENTINE,"Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,"
107790,107791,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.67,VALENTINE,"For such is a friend now, treacherous man!"
107791,107792,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.68,VALENTINE,"Thou hast beguiled my hopes, nought but mine eye"
107792,107793,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.69,VALENTINE,Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
107793,107794,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.70,VALENTINE,"I have one friend alive, thou wouldst disprove me."
107794,107795,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.71,VALENTINE,"Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand"
107795,107796,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.72,VALENTINE,"Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,"
107796,107797,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.73,VALENTINE,"I am sorry I must never trust thee more,"
107797,107798,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.74,VALENTINE,But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
107798,107799,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.75,VALENTINE,"The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,"
107799,107800,Two Gentlemen of Verona,18.0,5.4.76,VALENTINE,'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
107800,107801,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.77,PROTEUS,My shame and guilt confounds me.
107801,107802,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.78,PROTEUS,"Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow"
107802,107803,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.79,PROTEUS,"Be a sufficient ransom for offence,"
107803,107804,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.80,PROTEUS,"I tender 't here, I do as truly suffer"
107804,107805,Two Gentlemen of Verona,19.0,5.4.81,PROTEUS,As e'er I did commit.
107805,107806,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.82,VALENTINE,"Then I am paid,"
107806,107807,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.83,VALENTINE,And once again I do receive thee honest.
107807,107808,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.84,VALENTINE,Who by repentance is not satisfied
107808,107809,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.85,VALENTINE,"Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased."
107809,107810,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.86,VALENTINE,By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
107810,107811,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.87,VALENTINE,"And, that my love may appear plain and free,"
107811,107812,Two Gentlemen of Verona,20.0,5.4.88,VALENTINE,All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
107812,107813,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,5.4.89,JULIA,O me unhappy!
107813,107814,Two Gentlemen of Verona,21.0,,JULIA,Swoons
107814,107815,Two Gentlemen of Verona,22.0,5.4.90,PROTEUS,Look to the boy.
107815,107816,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,5.4.91,VALENTINE,"Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?"
107816,107817,Two Gentlemen of Verona,23.0,5.4.92,VALENTINE,"Look up, speak."
107817,107818,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,5.4.93,JULIA,"O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring"
107818,107819,Two Gentlemen of Verona,24.0,5.4.94,JULIA,"to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done."
107819,107820,Two Gentlemen of Verona,25.0,5.4.95,PROTEUS,"Where is that ring, boy?"
107820,107821,Two Gentlemen of Verona,26.0,5.4.96,JULIA,"Here 'tis, this is it."
107821,107822,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,5.4.97,PROTEUS,How! let me see:
107822,107823,Two Gentlemen of Verona,27.0,5.4.98,PROTEUS,"Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia."
107823,107824,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.4.99,JULIA,"O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:"
107824,107825,Two Gentlemen of Verona,28.0,5.4.100,JULIA,This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
107825,107826,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,5.4.101,PROTEUS,But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
107826,107827,Two Gentlemen of Verona,29.0,5.4.102,PROTEUS,I gave this unto Julia.
107827,107828,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,5.4.103,JULIA,"And Julia herself did give it me,"
107828,107829,Two Gentlemen of Verona,30.0,5.4.104,JULIA,And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
107829,107830,Two Gentlemen of Verona,31.0,5.4.105,PROTEUS,How! Julia!
107830,107831,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.106,JULIA,"Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,"
107831,107832,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.107,JULIA,And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
107832,107833,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.108,JULIA,How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
107833,107834,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.109,JULIA,"O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!"
107834,107835,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.110,JULIA,Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
107835,107836,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.111,JULIA,"Such an immodest raiment, if shame live"
107836,107837,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.112,JULIA,In a disguise of love:
107837,107838,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.113,JULIA,"It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,"
107838,107839,Two Gentlemen of Verona,32.0,5.4.114,JULIA,Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
107839,107840,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.115,PROTEUS,Than men their minds! 'tis true.
107840,107841,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.116,PROTEUS,O heaven! were man
107841,107842,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.117,PROTEUS,"But constant, he were perfect. That one error"
107842,107843,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.118,PROTEUS,"Fills him with faults, makes him run through all the sins:"
107843,107844,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.119,PROTEUS,Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
107844,107845,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.120,PROTEUS,"What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy"
107845,107846,Two Gentlemen of Verona,33.0,5.4.121,PROTEUS,More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
107846,107847,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.4.122,VALENTINE,"Come, come, a hand from either:"
107847,107848,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.4.123,VALENTINE,"Let me be blest to make this happy close,"
107848,107849,Two Gentlemen of Verona,34.0,5.4.124,VALENTINE,'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
107849,107850,Two Gentlemen of Verona,35.0,5.4.125,PROTEUS,"Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever."
107850,107851,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,5.4.126,JULIA,And I mine.
107851,107852,Two Gentlemen of Verona,36.0,,JULIA,"Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO"
107852,107853,Two Gentlemen of Verona,37.0,5.4.127,Outlaws,"A prize, a prize, a prize!"
107853,107854,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,5.4.128,VALENTINE,"Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke."
107854,107855,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,5.4.129,VALENTINE,"Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,"
107855,107856,Two Gentlemen of Verona,38.0,5.4.130,VALENTINE,Banished Valentine.
107856,107857,Two Gentlemen of Verona,39.0,5.4.131,DUKE,Sir Valentine!
107857,107858,Two Gentlemen of Verona,40.0,5.4.132,THURIO,"Yonder is Silvia, and Silvia's mine."
107858,107859,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.133,VALENTINE,"Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death,"
107859,107860,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.134,VALENTINE,"Come not within the measure of my wrath,"
107860,107861,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.135,VALENTINE,"Do not name Silvia thine, if once again,"
107861,107862,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.136,VALENTINE,"Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands,"
107862,107863,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.137,VALENTINE,Take but possession of her with a touch:
107863,107864,Two Gentlemen of Verona,41.0,5.4.138,VALENTINE,I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
107864,107865,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.139,THURIO,"Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I,"
107865,107866,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.140,THURIO,I hold him but a fool that will endanger
107866,107867,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.141,THURIO,His body for a girl that loves him not:
107867,107868,Two Gentlemen of Verona,42.0,5.4.142,THURIO,"I claim her not, and therefore she is thine."
107868,107869,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.143,DUKE,"The more degenerate and base art thou,"
107869,107870,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.144,DUKE,To make such means for her as thou hast done
107870,107871,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.145,DUKE,And leave her on such slight conditions.
107871,107872,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.146,DUKE,"Now, by the honour of my ancestry,"
107872,107873,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.147,DUKE,"I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,"
107873,107874,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.148,DUKE,And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
107874,107875,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.149,DUKE,"Know then, I here forget all former griefs,"
107875,107876,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.150,DUKE,"Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,"
107876,107877,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.151,DUKE,"Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,"
107877,107878,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.152,DUKE,"To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,"
107878,107879,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.153,DUKE,"Thou art a gentleman and well derived,"
107879,107880,Two Gentlemen of Verona,43.0,5.4.154,DUKE,"Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her."
107880,107881,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,5.4.155,VALENTINE,"I thank your grace, the gift hath made me happy."
107881,107882,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,5.4.156,VALENTINE,"I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,"
107882,107883,Two Gentlemen of Verona,44.0,5.4.157,VALENTINE,To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
107883,107884,Two Gentlemen of Verona,45.0,5.4.158,DUKE,"I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be."
107884,107885,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,5.4.159,VALENTINE,These banish'd men that I have kept withal
107885,107886,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,5.4.160,VALENTINE,Are men endued with worthy qualities:

107887,107888,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,5.4.162,VALENTINE,And let them be recall'd from their exile:
107888,107889,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,5.4.163,VALENTINE,"They are reformed, civil, full of good"
107889,107890,Two Gentlemen of Verona,46.0,5.4.164,VALENTINE,"And fit for great employment, worthy lord."
107890,107891,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,5.4.165,DUKE,"Thou hast prevail'd, I pardon them and thee:"
107891,107892,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,5.4.166,DUKE,Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
107892,107893,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,5.4.167,DUKE,"Come, let us go: we will include all jars"
107893,107894,Two Gentlemen of Verona,47.0,5.4.168,DUKE,"With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity."
107894,107895,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,5.4.169,VALENTINE,"And, as we walk along, I dare be bold"
107895,107896,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,5.4.170,VALENTINE,With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
107896,107897,Two Gentlemen of Verona,48.0,5.4.171,VALENTINE,"What think you of this page, my lord?"
107897,107898,Two Gentlemen of Verona,49.0,5.4.172,DUKE,"I think the boy hath grace in him, he blushes."
107898,107899,Two Gentlemen of Verona,50.0,5.4.173,VALENTINE,"I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy."
107899,107900,Two Gentlemen of Verona,51.0,5.4.174,DUKE,What mean you by that saying?
107900,107901,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,5.4.175,VALENTINE,"Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,"
107901,107902,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,5.4.176,VALENTINE,That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
107902,107903,Two Gentlemen of Verona,52.0,5.4.177,VALENTINE,"Come, Proteus, 'tis your penance but to hear"

55800,55801,macbeth,1.0,1.2.3,DUNCAN,The newest state.
55801,55802,macbeth,2.0,1.2.4,MALCOLM,This is the sergeant
55802,55803,macbeth,2.0,1.2.5,MALCOLM,Who like a good and hardy soldier fought

55807,55808,macbeth,3.0,1.2.10,Sergeant,"As two spent swimmers, that do cling together"
55808,55809,macbeth,3.0,1.2.11,Sergeant,And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--

55814,55815,macbeth,3.0,1.2.17,Sergeant,Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:

55821,55822,macbeth,3.0,1.2.24,Sergeant,"Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,"
55822,55823,macbeth,3.0,1.2.25,Sergeant,And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
55823,55824,macbeth,4.0,1.2.26,DUNCAN,O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
55824,55825,macbeth,5.0,1.2.27,Sergeant,As whence the sun 'gins his reflection

55826,55827,macbeth,5.0,1.2.29,Sergeant,So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come

55836,55837,macbeth,7.0,1.2.39,Sergeant,"As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion."
55837,55838,macbeth,7.0,1.2.40,Sergeant,"If I say sooth, I must report they were"
55838,55839,macbeth,7.0,1.2.41,Sergeant,"As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they"
55839,55840,macbeth,7.0,1.2.42,Sergeant,Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
55840,55841,macbeth,7.0,1.2.43,Sergeant,"Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,"
55841,55842,macbeth,7.0,1.2.44,Sergeant,"Or memorise another Golgotha,"

55843,55844,macbeth,7.0,1.2.46,Sergeant,"But I am faint, my gashes cry for help."
55844,55845,macbeth,8.0,1.2.47,DUNCAN,"So well thy words become thee as thy wounds,"
55845,55846,macbeth,8.0,1.2.48,DUNCAN,They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.

55851,55852,macbeth,10.0,1.2.52,LENNOX,That seems to speak things strange.
55852,55853,macbeth,11.0,1.2.53,ROSS,God save the king!
55853,55854,macbeth,12.0,1.2.54,DUNCAN,"Whence camest thou, worthy thane?"

55855,55856,macbeth,13.0,1.2.56,ROSS,Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
55856,55857,macbeth,13.0,1.2.57,ROSS,"And fan our people cold. Norway himself,"
55857,55858,macbeth,13.0,1.2.58,ROSS,"With terrible numbers,"
55858,55859,macbeth,13.0,1.2.59,ROSS,Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
55859,55860,macbeth,13.0,1.2.60,ROSS,"The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,"
55860,55861,macbeth,13.0,1.2.61,ROSS,"Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,"
55861,55862,macbeth,13.0,1.2.62,ROSS,"Confronted him with self-comparisons,"

55863,55864,macbeth,13.0,1.2.64,ROSS,"Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,"
55864,55865,macbeth,13.0,1.2.65,ROSS,The victory fell on us.
55865,55866,macbeth,14.0,1.2.66,DUNCAN,Great happiness!

55868,55869,macbeth,15.0,1.2.69,ROSS,Nor would we deign him burial of his men
55869,55870,macbeth,15.0,1.2.70,ROSS,Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
55870,55871,macbeth,15.0,1.2.71,ROSS,Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
55871,55872,macbeth,16.0,1.2.72,DUNCAN,No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
55872,55873,macbeth,16.0,1.2.73,DUNCAN,"Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,"
55873,55874,macbeth,16.0,1.2.74,DUNCAN,And with his former title greet Macbeth.
55874,55875,macbeth,17.0,1.2.75,ROSS,I'll see it done.
55875,55876,macbeth,18.0,1.2.76,DUNCAN,What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

55921,55922,macbeth,14.0,1.3.41,BANQUO,"So wither'd and so wild in their attire,"
55922,55923,macbeth,14.0,1.3.42,BANQUO,"That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,"
55923,55924,macbeth,14.0,1.3.43,BANQUO,And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
55924,55925,macbeth,14.0,1.3.44,BANQUO,"That man may question? You seem to understand me,"
55925,55926,macbeth,14.0,1.3.45,BANQUO,By each at once her chappy finger laying

55954,55955,macbeth,27.0,1.3.74,MACBETH,"But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,"
55955,55956,macbeth,27.0,1.3.75,MACBETH,"A prosperous gentleman, and to be king"
55956,55957,macbeth,27.0,1.3.76,MACBETH,"Stands not within the prospect of belief,"
55957,55958,macbeth,27.0,1.3.77,MACBETH,No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
55958,55959,macbeth,27.0,1.3.78,MACBETH,You owe this strange intelligence? or why
55959,55960,macbeth,27.0,1.3.79,MACBETH,Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
55960,55961,macbeth,27.0,1.3.80,MACBETH,"With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you."

55965,55966,macbeth,29.0,1.3.84,MACBETH,As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
55966,55967,macbeth,30.0,1.3.85,BANQUO,Were such things here as we do speak about?
55967,55968,macbeth,30.0,1.3.86,BANQUO,Or have we eaten on the insane root
55968,55969,macbeth,30.0,1.3.87,BANQUO,That takes the reason prisoner?
55969,55970,macbeth,31.0,1.3.88,MACBETH,Your children shall be kings.
55970,55971,macbeth,32.0,1.3.89,BANQUO,You shall be king.

55972,55973,macbeth,34.0,1.3.91,BANQUO,To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

56013,56014,macbeth,42.0,1.3.129,BANQUO,That trusted home
56014,56015,macbeth,42.0,1.3.130,BANQUO,"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"
56015,56016,macbeth,42.0,1.3.131,BANQUO,Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
56016,56017,macbeth,42.0,1.3.132,BANQUO,"And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,"
56017,56018,macbeth,42.0,1.3.133,BANQUO,"The instruments of darkness tell us truths,"

56022,56023,macbeth,43.0,1.3.138,MACBETH,As happy prologues to the swelling act

56027,56028,macbeth,43.0,1.3.142,MACBETH,Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
56028,56029,macbeth,43.0,1.3.143,MACBETH,"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion"
56029,56030,macbeth,43.0,1.3.144,MACBETH,Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
56030,56031,macbeth,43.0,1.3.145,MACBETH,"And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,"
56031,56032,macbeth,43.0,1.3.146,MACBETH,Against the use of nature? Present fears
56032,56033,macbeth,43.0,1.3.147,MACBETH,Are less than horrible imaginings:

56036,56037,macbeth,43.0,1.3.151,MACBETH,But what is not.

56046,56047,macbeth,49.0,1.3.161,MACBETH,Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
56047,56048,macbeth,49.0,1.3.162,MACBETH,"With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains"
56048,56049,macbeth,49.0,1.3.163,MACBETH,Are register'd where every day I turn
56049,56050,macbeth,49.0,1.3.164,MACBETH,The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
56050,56051,macbeth,49.0,1.3.165,MACBETH,"Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,"

56052,56053,macbeth,49.0,1.3.167,MACBETH,Our free hearts each to other.
56053,56054,macbeth,50.0,1.3.168,BANQUO,Very gladly.

56061,56062,macbeth,2.0,1.4.4,MALCOLM,They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
56062,56063,macbeth,2.0,1.4.5,MALCOLM,With one that saw him die: who did report
56063,56064,macbeth,2.0,1.4.6,MALCOLM,"That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,"
56064,56065,macbeth,2.0,1.4.7,MALCOLM,Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
56065,56066,macbeth,2.0,1.4.8,MALCOLM,A deep repentance: nothing in his life
56066,56067,macbeth,2.0,1.4.9,MALCOLM,"Became him like the leaving it, he died"
56067,56068,macbeth,2.0,1.4.10,MALCOLM,As one that had been studied in his death
56068,56069,macbeth,2.0,1.4.11,MALCOLM,"To throw away the dearest thing he owed,"
56069,56070,macbeth,2.0,1.4.12,MALCOLM,As 'twere a careless trifle.

56077,56078,macbeth,3.0,1.4.19,DUNCAN,Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
56078,56079,macbeth,3.0,1.4.20,DUNCAN,That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
56079,56080,macbeth,3.0,1.4.21,DUNCAN,"To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,"
56080,56081,macbeth,3.0,1.4.22,DUNCAN,That the proportion both of thanks and payment
56081,56082,macbeth,3.0,1.4.23,DUNCAN,"Might have been mine! only I have left to say,"
56082,56083,macbeth,3.0,1.4.24,DUNCAN,More is thy due than more than all can pay.
56083,56084,macbeth,4.0,1.4.25,MACBETH,"The service and the loyalty I owe,"
56084,56085,macbeth,4.0,1.4.26,MACBETH,"In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part"
56085,56086,macbeth,4.0,1.4.27,MACBETH,"Is to receive our duties, and our duties"
56086,56087,macbeth,4.0,1.4.28,MACBETH,"Are to your throne and state children and servants,"
56087,56088,macbeth,4.0,1.4.29,MACBETH,"Which do but what they should, by doing every thing"

56092,56093,macbeth,5.0,1.4.34,DUNCAN,"That hast no less deserved, nor must be known"

56099,56100,macbeth,7.0,1.4.41,DUNCAN,"In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,"
56100,56101,macbeth,7.0,1.4.42,DUNCAN,"And you whose places are the nearest, know"
56101,56102,macbeth,7.0,1.4.43,DUNCAN,We will establish our estate upon

56115,56116,macbeth,10.0,1.4.57,MACBETH,"For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires,"

56123,56124,macbeth,11.0,1.4.64,DUNCAN,Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:

56356,56357,macbeth,3.0,2.1.3,BANQUO,And she goes down at twelve.
56357,56358,macbeth,4.0,2.1.4,FLEANCE,"I take't, 'tis later, sir."
56358,56359,macbeth,5.0,2.1.5,BANQUO,"Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven,"
56359,56360,macbeth,5.0,2.1.6,BANQUO,Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
56360,56361,macbeth,5.0,2.1.7,BANQUO,"A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,"
56361,56362,macbeth,5.0,2.1.8,BANQUO,"And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,"
56362,56363,macbeth,5.0,2.1.9,BANQUO,Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
56363,56364,macbeth,5.0,2.1.10,BANQUO,Gives way to in repose!
56364,56365,macbeth,5.0,,BANQUO,"Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch"
56365,56366,macbeth,5.0,2.1.11,BANQUO,Give me my sword.
56366,56367,macbeth,5.0,2.1.12,BANQUO,Who's there?
56367,56368,macbeth,6.0,2.1.13,MACBETH,A friend.
56368,56369,macbeth,7.0,2.1.14,BANQUO,"What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:"
56369,56370,macbeth,7.0,2.1.15,BANQUO,"He hath been in unusual pleasure, and"
56370,56371,macbeth,7.0,2.1.16,BANQUO,Sent forth great largess to your offices.
56371,56372,macbeth,7.0,2.1.17,BANQUO,"This diamond he greets your wife withal,"
56372,56373,macbeth,7.0,2.1.18,BANQUO,"By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up"
56373,56374,macbeth,7.0,2.1.19,BANQUO,In measureless content.
56374,56375,macbeth,8.0,2.1.20,MACBETH,"Being unprepared,"
56375,56376,macbeth,8.0,2.1.21,MACBETH,"Our will became the servant to defect,"
56376,56377,macbeth,8.0,2.1.22,MACBETH,Which else should free have wrought.
56377,56378,macbeth,9.0,2.1.23,BANQUO,All's well.
56378,56379,macbeth,9.0,2.1.24,BANQUO,I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
56379,56380,macbeth,9.0,2.1.25,BANQUO,To you they have show'd some truth.
56380,56381,macbeth,10.0,2.1.26,MACBETH,I think not of them:
56381,56382,macbeth,10.0,2.1.27,MACBETH,"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,"
56382,56383,macbeth,10.0,2.1.28,MACBETH,"We would spend it in some words upon that business,"
56383,56384,macbeth,10.0,2.1.29,MACBETH,If you would grant the time.
56384,56385,macbeth,11.0,2.1.30,BANQUO,At your kind'st leisure.
56385,56386,macbeth,12.0,2.1.31,MACBETH,"If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,"
56386,56387,macbeth,12.0,2.1.32,MACBETH,It shall make honour for you.
56387,56388,macbeth,13.0,2.1.33,BANQUO,So I lose none
56388,56389,macbeth,13.0,2.1.34,BANQUO,"In seeking to augment it, but still keep"
56389,56390,macbeth,13.0,2.1.35,BANQUO,"My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,"
56390,56391,macbeth,13.0,2.1.36,BANQUO,I shall be counsell'd.
56391,56392,macbeth,14.0,2.1.37,MACBETH,Good repose the while!
56392,56393,macbeth,15.0,2.1.38,BANQUO,"Thanks, sir: the like to you!"
56393,56394,macbeth,15.0,,BANQUO,Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE
56394,56395,macbeth,16.0,2.1.39,MACBETH,"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,"
56395,56396,macbeth,16.0,2.1.40,MACBETH,She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
56396,56397,macbeth,16.0,,MACBETH,Exit Servant
56397,56398,macbeth,16.0,2.1.41,MACBETH,"Is this a dagger which I see before me,"
56398,56399,macbeth,16.0,2.1.42,MACBETH,"The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee."
56399,56400,macbeth,16.0,2.1.43,MACBETH,"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still."
56400,56401,macbeth,16.0,2.1.44,MACBETH,"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible"
56401,56402,macbeth,16.0,2.1.45,MACBETH,To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
56402,56403,macbeth,16.0,2.1.46,MACBETH,"A dagger of the mind, a false creation,"
56403,56404,macbeth,16.0,2.1.47,MACBETH,Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
56404,56405,macbeth,16.0,2.1.48,MACBETH,"I see thee yet, in form as palpable"
56405,56406,macbeth,16.0,2.1.49,MACBETH,As this which now I draw.
56406,56407,macbeth,16.0,2.1.50,MACBETH,"Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going,"
56407,56408,macbeth,16.0,2.1.51,MACBETH,And such an instrument I was to use.
56408,56409,macbeth,16.0,2.1.52,MACBETH,"Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,"
56409,56410,macbeth,16.0,2.1.53,MACBETH,"Or else worth all the rest, I see thee still,"
56410,56411,macbeth,16.0,2.1.54,MACBETH,"And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,"
56411,56412,macbeth,16.0,2.1.55,MACBETH,Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
56412,56413,macbeth,16.0,2.1.56,MACBETH,It is the bloody business which informs
56413,56414,macbeth,16.0,2.1.57,MACBETH,Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
56414,56415,macbeth,16.0,2.1.58,MACBETH,"Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse"
56415,56416,macbeth,16.0,2.1.59,MACBETH,"The curtain'd sleep, witchcraft celebrates"
56416,56417,macbeth,16.0,2.1.60,MACBETH,"Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,"
56417,56418,macbeth,16.0,2.1.61,MACBETH,"Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,"
56418,56419,macbeth,16.0,2.1.62,MACBETH,"Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace."
56419,56420,macbeth,16.0,2.1.63,MACBETH,"With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design"
56420,56421,macbeth,16.0,2.1.64,MACBETH,"Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,"
56421,56422,macbeth,16.0,2.1.65,MACBETH,"Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear"
56422,56423,macbeth,16.0,2.1.66,MACBETH,"Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,"
56423,56424,macbeth,16.0,2.1.67,MACBETH,"And take the present horror from the time,"
56424,56425,macbeth,16.0,2.1.68,MACBETH,"Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:"
56425,56426,macbeth,16.0,2.1.69,MACBETH,Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
56426,56427,macbeth,16.0,,MACBETH,A bell rings
56427,56428,macbeth,16.0,2.1.70,MACBETH,"I go, and it is done, the bell invites me."
56428,56429,macbeth,16.0,2.1.71,MACBETH,"Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell"
56429,56430,macbeth,16.0,2.1.72,MACBETH,That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
56430,56431,macbeth,16.0,,MACBETH,Exit
56431,56432,macbeth,16.0,,MACBETH,SCENE II. The same.
56432,56433,macbeth,16.0,,MACBETH,Enter LADY MACBETH
56433,56434,macbeth,1.0,2.2.1,LADY MACBETH,"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold,"
56434,56435,macbeth,1.0,2.2.2,LADY MACBETH,What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
56435,56436,macbeth,1.0,2.2.3,LADY MACBETH,Hark! Peace!
56436,56437,macbeth,1.0,2.2.4,LADY MACBETH,"It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,"
56437,56438,macbeth,1.0,2.2.5,LADY MACBETH,Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
56438,56439,macbeth,1.0,2.2.6,LADY MACBETH,"The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms"
56439,56440,macbeth,1.0,2.2.7,LADY MACBETH,Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
56440,56441,macbeth,1.0,2.2.8,LADY MACBETH,"their possets,"
56441,56442,macbeth,1.0,2.2.9,LADY MACBETH,"That death and nature do contend about them,"
56442,56443,macbeth,1.0,2.2.10,LADY MACBETH,Whether they live or die.
56443,56444,macbeth,2.0,2.2.11,MACBETH,"[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!"
56444,56445,macbeth,3.0,2.2.12,LADY MACBETH,"Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,"
56445,56446,macbeth,3.0,2.2.13,LADY MACBETH,And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
56446,56447,macbeth,3.0,2.2.14,LADY MACBETH,"Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready,"
56447,56448,macbeth,3.0,2.2.15,LADY MACBETH,He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
56448,56449,macbeth,3.0,2.2.16,LADY MACBETH,"My father as he slept, I had done't."
56449,56450,macbeth,3.0,,LADY MACBETH,Enter MACBETH
56450,56451,macbeth,3.0,2.2.17,LADY MACBETH,My husband!
56451,56452,macbeth,4.0,2.2.18,MACBETH,I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
56452,56453,macbeth,5.0,2.2.19,LADY MACBETH,I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
56453,56454,macbeth,5.0,2.2.20,LADY MACBETH,Did not you speak?
56454,56455,macbeth,6.0,2.2.21,MACBETH,When?
56455,56456,macbeth,7.0,2.2.22,LADY MACBETH,Now.
56456,56457,macbeth,8.0,2.2.23,MACBETH,As I descended?
56457,56458,macbeth,9.0,2.2.24,LADY MACBETH,Ay.
56458,56459,macbeth,10.0,2.2.25,MACBETH,Hark!
56459,56460,macbeth,10.0,2.2.26,MACBETH,Who lies i' the second chamber?
56460,56461,macbeth,11.0,2.2.27,LADY MACBETH,Donalbain.
56461,56462,macbeth,12.0,2.2.28,MACBETH,This is a sorry sight.
56462,56463,macbeth,12.0,,MACBETH,Looking on his hands
56463,56464,macbeth,13.0,2.2.29,LADY MACBETH,"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight."
56464,56465,macbeth,14.0,2.2.30,MACBETH,"There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried"
56465,56466,macbeth,14.0,2.2.31,MACBETH,'Murder!'
56466,56467,macbeth,14.0,2.2.32,MACBETH,That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
56467,56468,macbeth,14.0,2.2.33,MACBETH,"But they did say their prayers, and address'd them"
56468,56469,macbeth,14.0,2.2.34,MACBETH,Again to sleep.
56469,56470,macbeth,15.0,2.2.35,LADY MACBETH,There are two lodged together.
56470,56471,macbeth,16.0,2.2.36,MACBETH,"One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other,"
56471,56472,macbeth,16.0,2.2.37,MACBETH,As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
56472,56473,macbeth,16.0,2.2.38,MACBETH,"Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'"
56473,56474,macbeth,16.0,2.2.39,MACBETH,When they did say 'God bless us!'
56474,56475,macbeth,17.0,2.2.40,LADY MACBETH,Consider it not so deeply.
56475,56476,macbeth,18.0,2.2.41,MACBETH,But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
56476,56477,macbeth,18.0,2.2.42,MACBETH,"I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'"
56477,56478,macbeth,18.0,2.2.43,MACBETH,Stuck in my throat.
56478,56479,macbeth,19.0,2.2.44,LADY MACBETH,These deeds must not be thought
56479,56480,macbeth,19.0,2.2.45,LADY MACBETH,"After these ways, so, it will make us mad."
56480,56481,macbeth,20.0,2.2.46,MACBETH,Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
56481,56482,macbeth,20.0,2.2.47,MACBETH,"Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,"
56482,56483,macbeth,20.0,2.2.48,MACBETH,"Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,"
56483,56484,macbeth,20.0,2.2.49,MACBETH,"The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,"
56484,56485,macbeth,20.0,2.2.50,MACBETH,"Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,"
56485,56486,macbeth,20.0,2.2.51,MACBETH,"Chief nourisher in life's feast,--"
56486,56487,macbeth,21.0,2.2.52,LADY MACBETH,What do you mean?
56487,56488,macbeth,22.0,2.2.53,MACBETH,Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
56488,56489,macbeth,22.0,2.2.54,MACBETH,"'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor"
56489,56490,macbeth,22.0,2.2.55,MACBETH,"Shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no more.'"
56490,56491,macbeth,23.0,2.2.56,LADY MACBETH,"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,"
56491,56492,macbeth,23.0,2.2.57,LADY MACBETH,"You do unbend your noble strength, to think"
56492,56493,macbeth,23.0,2.2.58,LADY MACBETH,"So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,"
56493,56494,macbeth,23.0,2.2.59,LADY MACBETH,And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
56494,56495,macbeth,23.0,2.2.60,LADY MACBETH,Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
56495,56496,macbeth,23.0,2.2.61,LADY MACBETH,"They must lie there: go carry them, and smear"
56496,56497,macbeth,23.0,2.2.62,LADY MACBETH,The sleepy grooms with blood.
56497,56498,macbeth,24.0,2.2.63,MACBETH,I'll go no more:
56498,56499,macbeth,24.0,2.2.64,MACBETH,"I am afraid to think what I have done,"
56499,56500,macbeth,24.0,2.2.65,MACBETH,Look on't again I dare not.
56500,56501,macbeth,25.0,2.2.66,LADY MACBETH,Infirm of purpose!
56501,56502,macbeth,25.0,2.2.67,LADY MACBETH,Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
56502,56503,macbeth,25.0,2.2.68,LADY MACBETH,Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
56503,56504,macbeth,25.0,2.2.69,LADY MACBETH,"That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,"
56504,56505,macbeth,25.0,2.2.70,LADY MACBETH,"I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,"
56505,56506,macbeth,25.0,2.2.71,LADY MACBETH,For it must seem their guilt.
56506,56507,macbeth,25.0,,LADY MACBETH,Exit. Knocking within
56507,56508,macbeth,26.0,2.2.72,MACBETH,Whence is that knocking?
56508,56509,macbeth,26.0,2.2.73,MACBETH,"How is't with me, when every noise appals me?"
56509,56510,macbeth,26.0,2.2.74,MACBETH,What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
56510,56511,macbeth,26.0,2.2.75,MACBETH,Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
56511,56512,macbeth,26.0,2.2.76,MACBETH,"Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather"
56512,56513,macbeth,26.0,2.2.77,MACBETH,"The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,"
56513,56514,macbeth,26.0,2.2.78,MACBETH,Making the green one red.
56514,56515,macbeth,26.0,,MACBETH,Re-enter LADY MACBETH
56515,56516,macbeth,27.0,2.2.79,LADY MACBETH,"My hands are of your colour, but I shame"
56516,56517,macbeth,27.0,2.2.80,LADY MACBETH,To wear a heart so white.
56517,56518,macbeth,27.0,,LADY MACBETH,Knocking within
56518,56519,macbeth,27.0,2.2.81,LADY MACBETH,I hear a knocking
56519,56520,macbeth,27.0,2.2.82,LADY MACBETH,"At the south entry: retire we to our chamber,"
56520,56521,macbeth,27.0,2.2.83,LADY MACBETH,A little water clears us of this deed:
56521,56522,macbeth,27.0,2.2.84,LADY MACBETH,"How easy is it, then! Your constancy"
56522,56523,macbeth,27.0,2.2.85,LADY MACBETH,Hath left you unattended.
56523,56524,macbeth,27.0,,LADY MACBETH,Knocking within
56524,56525,macbeth,27.0,2.2.86,LADY MACBETH,Hark! more knocking.
56525,56526,macbeth,27.0,2.2.87,LADY MACBETH,"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,"
56526,56527,macbeth,27.0,2.2.88,LADY MACBETH,And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
56527,56528,macbeth,27.0,2.2.89,LADY MACBETH,So poorly in your thoughts.
56528,56529,macbeth,28.0,2.2.90,MACBETH,"To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself."
56529,56530,macbeth,28.0,,MACBETH,Knocking within
56530,56531,macbeth,28.0,2.2.91,MACBETH,Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
56531,56532,macbeth,28.0,,MACBETH,Exeunt
56532,56533,macbeth,28.0,,MACBETH,SCENE III. The same.
56533,56534,macbeth,28.0,,MACBETH,Knocking within. Enter a Porter
56534,56535,macbeth,1.0,2.3.1,Porter,Here's a knocking indeed! If a

56536,56537,macbeth,1.0,2.3.3,Porter,old turning the key.
56537,56538,macbeth,1.0,,Porter,Knocking within

56766,56767,macbeth,11.0,2.4.30,MACDUFF,They were suborn'd:

56796,56797,macbeth,1.0,3.1.5,BANQUO,But that myself should be the root and father
56797,56798,macbeth,1.0,3.1.6,BANQUO,Of many kings. If there come truth from them--

56857,56858,macbeth,16.0,3.1.62,MACBETH,And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
56858,56859,macbeth,16.0,3.1.63,MACBETH,They hail'd him father to a line of kings:

56862,56863,macbeth,16.0,3.1.67,MACBETH,"No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,"
56863,56864,macbeth,16.0,3.1.68,MACBETH,"For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,"

56880,56881,macbeth,18.0,3.1.83,MACBETH,Our innocent self: this I made good to you
56881,56882,macbeth,18.0,3.1.84,MACBETH,"In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,"
56882,56883,macbeth,18.0,3.1.85,MACBETH,"How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,"

56891,56892,macbeth,20.0,3.1.94,MACBETH,That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
56892,56893,macbeth,20.0,3.1.95,MACBETH,"To pray for this good man and for his issue,"
56893,56894,macbeth,20.0,3.1.96,MACBETH,Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave

56899,56900,macbeth,22.0,3.1.102,MACBETH,All by the name of dogs: the valued file

57509,57510,macbeth,48.0,4.1.153,LENNOX,"No, indeed, my lord."
57510,57511,macbeth,49.0,4.1.154,MACBETH,"Infected be the air whereon they ride,"
57511,57512,macbeth,49.0,4.1.155,MACBETH,And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
57512,57513,macbeth,49.0,4.1.156,MACBETH,The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
57513,57514,macbeth,50.0,4.1.157,LENNOX,"'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word"
57514,57515,macbeth,50.0,4.1.158,LENNOX,Macduff is fled to England.
57515,57516,macbeth,51.0,4.1.159,MACBETH,Fled to England!
57516,57517,macbeth,52.0,4.1.160,LENNOX,"Ay, my good lord."
57517,57518,macbeth,53.0,4.1.161,MACBETH,"Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:"
57518,57519,macbeth,53.0,4.1.162,MACBETH,The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
57519,57520,macbeth,53.0,4.1.163,MACBETH,"Unless the deed go with it, from this moment"
57520,57521,macbeth,53.0,4.1.164,MACBETH,The very firstlings of my heart shall be
57521,57522,macbeth,53.0,4.1.165,MACBETH,"The firstlings of my hand. And even now,"
57522,57523,macbeth,53.0,4.1.166,MACBETH,"To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:"
57523,57524,macbeth,53.0,4.1.167,MACBETH,"The castle of Macduff I will surprise,"
57524,57525,macbeth,53.0,4.1.168,MACBETH,"Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword"
57525,57526,macbeth,53.0,4.1.169,MACBETH,"His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls"
57526,57527,macbeth,53.0,4.1.170,MACBETH,"That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool,"
57527,57528,macbeth,53.0,4.1.171,MACBETH,This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
57528,57529,macbeth,53.0,4.1.172,MACBETH,But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
57529,57530,macbeth,53.0,4.1.173,MACBETH,"Come, bring me where they are."
57530,57531,macbeth,53.0,,MACBETH,Exeunt
57531,57532,macbeth,53.0,,MACBETH,SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.
57532,57533,macbeth,53.0,,MACBETH,"Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS"
57533,57534,macbeth,1.0,4.2.1,LADY MACDUFF,"What had he done, to make him fly the land?"
57534,57535,macbeth,2.0,4.2.2,ROSS,"You must have patience, madam."
57535,57536,macbeth,3.0,4.2.3,LADY MACDUFF,He had none:
57536,57537,macbeth,3.0,4.2.4,LADY MACDUFF,"His flight was madness: when our actions do not,"
57537,57538,macbeth,3.0,4.2.5,LADY MACDUFF,Our fears do make us traitors.
57538,57539,macbeth,4.0,4.2.6,ROSS,You know not
57539,57540,macbeth,4.0,4.2.7,ROSS,Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
57540,57541,macbeth,5.0,4.2.8,LADY MACDUFF,"Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,"
57541,57542,macbeth,5.0,4.2.9,LADY MACDUFF,His mansion and his titles in a place
57542,57543,macbeth,5.0,4.2.10,LADY MACDUFF,"From whence himself does fly? He loves us not,"
57543,57544,macbeth,5.0,4.2.11,LADY MACDUFF,"He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,"
57544,57545,macbeth,5.0,4.2.12,LADY MACDUFF,"The most diminutive of birds, will fight,"
57545,57546,macbeth,5.0,4.2.13,LADY MACDUFF,"Her young ones in her nest, against the owl."
57546,57547,macbeth,5.0,4.2.14,LADY MACDUFF,"All is the fear and nothing is the love,"
57547,57548,macbeth,5.0,4.2.15,LADY MACDUFF,"As little is the wisdom, where the flight"
57548,57549,macbeth,5.0,4.2.16,LADY MACDUFF,So runs against all reason.
57549,57550,macbeth,6.0,4.2.17,ROSS,"My dearest coz,"
57550,57551,macbeth,6.0,4.2.18,ROSS,"I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,"
57551,57552,macbeth,6.0,4.2.19,ROSS,"He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows"
57552,57553,macbeth,6.0,4.2.20,ROSS,The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
57553,57554,macbeth,6.0,4.2.21,ROSS,"much further,"
57554,57555,macbeth,6.0,4.2.22,ROSS,"But cruel are the times, when we are traitors"
57555,57556,macbeth,6.0,4.2.23,ROSS,"And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour"
57556,57557,macbeth,6.0,4.2.24,ROSS,"From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,"
57557,57558,macbeth,6.0,4.2.25,ROSS,But float upon a wild and violent sea
57558,57559,macbeth,6.0,4.2.26,ROSS,Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
57559,57560,macbeth,6.0,4.2.27,ROSS,Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
57560,57561,macbeth,6.0,4.2.28,ROSS,"Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward"
57561,57562,macbeth,6.0,4.2.29,ROSS,"To what they were before. My pretty cousin,"
57562,57563,macbeth,6.0,4.2.30,ROSS,Blessing upon you!
57563,57564,macbeth,7.0,4.2.31,LADY MACDUFF,"Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless."
57564,57565,macbeth,8.0,4.2.32,ROSS,"I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,"
57565,57566,macbeth,8.0,4.2.33,ROSS,It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
57566,57567,macbeth,8.0,4.2.34,ROSS,I take my leave at once.
57567,57568,macbeth,8.0,,ROSS,Exit
57568,57569,macbeth,9.0,4.2.35,LADY MACDUFF,"Sirrah, your father's dead,"
57569,57570,macbeth,9.0,4.2.36,LADY MACDUFF,And what will you do now? How will you live?
57570,57571,macbeth,10.0,4.2.37,Son,"As birds do, mother."
57571,57572,macbeth,11.0,4.2.38,LADY MACDUFF,"What, with worms and flies?"
57572,57573,macbeth,12.0,4.2.39,Son,"With what I get, I mean, and so do they."
57573,57574,macbeth,13.0,4.2.40,LADY MACDUFF,"Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,"
57574,57575,macbeth,13.0,4.2.41,LADY MACDUFF,The pitfall nor the gin.
57575,57576,macbeth,14.0,4.2.42,Son,"Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for."
57576,57577,macbeth,14.0,4.2.43,Son,"My father is not dead, for all your saying."
57577,57578,macbeth,15.0,4.2.44,LADY MACDUFF,"Yes, he is dead, how wilt thou do for a father?"
57578,57579,macbeth,16.0,4.2.45,Son,"Nay, how will you do for a husband?"
57579,57580,macbeth,17.0,4.2.46,LADY MACDUFF,"Why, I can buy me twenty at any market."
57580,57581,macbeth,18.0,4.2.47,Son,Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
57581,57582,macbeth,19.0,4.2.48,LADY MACDUFF,"Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,"
57582,57583,macbeth,19.0,4.2.49,LADY MACDUFF,With wit enough for thee.
57583,57584,macbeth,20.0,4.2.50,Son,"Was my father a traitor, mother?"
57584,57585,macbeth,21.0,4.2.51,LADY MACDUFF,"Ay, that he was."
57585,57586,macbeth,22.0,4.2.52,Son,What is a traitor?
57586,57587,macbeth,23.0,4.2.53,LADY MACDUFF,"Why, one that swears and lies."
57587,57588,macbeth,24.0,4.2.54,Son,And be all traitors that do so?
57588,57589,macbeth,25.0,4.2.55,LADY MACDUFF,"Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged."
57589,57590,macbeth,26.0,4.2.56,Son,And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
57590,57591,macbeth,27.0,4.2.57,LADY MACDUFF,Every one.
57591,57592,macbeth,28.0,4.2.58,Son,Who must hang them?
57592,57593,macbeth,29.0,4.2.59,LADY MACDUFF,"Why,  the honest men."
57593,57594,macbeth,30.0,4.2.60,Son,"Then the liars and swearers are fools,"
57594,57595,macbeth,30.0,4.2.61,Son,for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
57595,57596,macbeth,30.0,4.2.62,Son,the honest men and hang up them.
57596,57597,macbeth,31.0,4.2.63,LADY MACDUFF,"Now, God help thee, poor monkey!"
57597,57598,macbeth,31.0,4.2.64,LADY MACDUFF,But how wilt thou do for a father?
57598,57599,macbeth,32.0,4.2.65,Son,"If he were dead, you'ld weep for"
57599,57600,macbeth,32.0,4.2.66,Son,"him: if you would not, it were a good sign"
57600,57601,macbeth,32.0,4.2.67,Son,that I should quickly have a new father.
57601,57602,macbeth,33.0,4.2.68,LADY MACDUFF,"Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!"
57602,57603,macbeth,33.0,,LADY MACDUFF,Enter a Messenger
57603,57604,macbeth,34.0,4.2.69,Messenger,"Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,"
57604,57605,macbeth,34.0,4.2.70,Messenger,Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
57605,57606,macbeth,34.0,4.2.71,Messenger,I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
57606,57607,macbeth,34.0,4.2.72,Messenger,"If you will take a homely man's advice,"
57607,57608,macbeth,34.0,4.2.73,Messenger,"Be not found here, hence, with your little ones."
57608,57609,macbeth,34.0,4.2.74,Messenger,"To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage,"
57609,57610,macbeth,34.0,4.2.75,Messenger,"To do worse to you were fell cruelty,"
57610,57611,macbeth,34.0,4.2.76,Messenger,Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
57611,57612,macbeth,34.0,4.2.77,Messenger,I dare abide no longer.
57612,57613,macbeth,34.0,,Messenger,Exit
57613,57614,macbeth,35.0,4.2.78,LADY MACDUFF,Whither should I fly?
57614,57615,macbeth,35.0,4.2.79,LADY MACDUFF,I have done no harm. But I remember now
57615,57616,macbeth,35.0,4.2.80,LADY MACDUFF,"I am in this earthly world, where to do harm"
57616,57617,macbeth,35.0,4.2.81,LADY MACDUFF,"Is often laudable, to do good sometime"
57617,57618,macbeth,35.0,4.2.82,LADY MACDUFF,"Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,"
57618,57619,macbeth,35.0,4.2.83,LADY MACDUFF,"Do I put up that womanly defence,"
57619,57620,macbeth,35.0,4.2.84,LADY MACDUFF,To say I have done no harm?
57620,57621,macbeth,35.0,,LADY MACDUFF,Enter Murderers
57621,57622,macbeth,35.0,4.2.85,LADY MACDUFF,What are these faces?
57622,57623,macbeth,36.0,4.2.86,First Murderer,Where is your husband?
57623,57624,macbeth,37.0,4.2.87,LADY MACDUFF,"I hope, in no place so unsanctified"
57624,57625,macbeth,37.0,4.2.88,LADY MACDUFF,Where such as thou mayst find him.
57625,57626,macbeth,38.0,4.2.89,First Murderer,He's a traitor.
57626,57627,macbeth,39.0,4.2.90,Son,"Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!"
57627,57628,macbeth,40.0,4.2.91,First Murderer,"What, you egg!"
57628,57629,macbeth,40.0,,First Murderer,Stabbing him
57629,57630,macbeth,40.0,4.2.92,First Murderer,Young fry of treachery!
57630,57631,macbeth,41.0,4.2.93,Son,"He has kill'd me, mother:"
57631,57632,macbeth,41.0,4.2.94,Son,"Run away, I pray you!"
57632,57633,macbeth,41.0,,Son,Dies
57633,57634,macbeth,41.0,,Son,"Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her"
57634,57635,macbeth,41.0,,Son,SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.
57635,57636,macbeth,41.0,,Son,Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF
57636,57637,macbeth,1.0,4.3.1,MALCOLM,"Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there"
57637,57638,macbeth,1.0,4.3.2,MALCOLM,Weep our sad bosoms empty.
57638,57639,macbeth,2.0,4.3.3,MACDUFF,Let us rather
57639,57640,macbeth,2.0,4.3.4,MACDUFF,"Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men"
57640,57641,macbeth,2.0,4.3.5,MACDUFF,Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
57641,57642,macbeth,2.0,4.3.6,MACDUFF,"New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows"
57642,57643,macbeth,2.0,4.3.7,MACDUFF,"Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds"
57643,57644,macbeth,2.0,4.3.8,MACDUFF,As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
57644,57645,macbeth,2.0,4.3.9,MACDUFF,Like syllable of dolour.
57645,57646,macbeth,3.0,4.3.10,MALCOLM,"What I believe I'll wail,"
57646,57647,macbeth,3.0,4.3.11,MALCOLM,"What know believe, and what I can redress,"
57647,57648,macbeth,3.0,4.3.12,MALCOLM,"As I shall find the time to friend, I will."
57648,57649,macbeth,3.0,4.3.13,MALCOLM,"What you have spoke, it may be so perchance."
57649,57650,macbeth,3.0,4.3.14,MALCOLM,"This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,"
57650,57651,macbeth,3.0,4.3.15,MALCOLM,Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
57651,57652,macbeth,3.0,4.3.16,MALCOLM,"He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young,"
57652,57653,macbeth,3.0,4.3.17,MALCOLM,but something
57653,57654,macbeth,3.0,4.3.18,MALCOLM,"You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom"
57654,57655,macbeth,3.0,4.3.19,MALCOLM,To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
57655,57656,macbeth,3.0,4.3.20,MALCOLM,To appease an angry god.
57656,57657,macbeth,4.0,4.3.21,MACDUFF,I am not treacherous.
57657,57658,macbeth,5.0,4.3.22,MALCOLM,But Macbeth is.
57658,57659,macbeth,5.0,4.3.23,MALCOLM,A good and virtuous nature may recoil
57659,57660,macbeth,5.0,4.3.24,MALCOLM,In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
57660,57661,macbeth,5.0,4.3.25,MALCOLM,"your pardon,"
57661,57662,macbeth,5.0,4.3.26,MALCOLM,That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
57662,57663,macbeth,5.0,4.3.27,MALCOLM,"Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell,"
57663,57664,macbeth,5.0,4.3.28,MALCOLM,"Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,"
57664,57665,macbeth,5.0,4.3.29,MALCOLM,Yet grace must still look so.
57665,57666,macbeth,6.0,4.3.30,MACDUFF,I have lost my hopes.
57666,57667,macbeth,7.0,4.3.31,MALCOLM,Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
57667,57668,macbeth,7.0,4.3.32,MALCOLM,"Why in that rawness left you wife and child,"
57668,57669,macbeth,7.0,4.3.33,MALCOLM,"Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,"
57669,57670,macbeth,7.0,4.3.34,MALCOLM,"Without leave-taking? I pray you,"
57670,57671,macbeth,7.0,4.3.35,MALCOLM,"Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,"
57671,57672,macbeth,7.0,4.3.36,MALCOLM,"But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,"
57672,57673,macbeth,7.0,4.3.37,MALCOLM,Whatever I shall think.
57673,57674,macbeth,8.0,4.3.38,MACDUFF,"Bleed, bleed, poor country!"
57674,57675,macbeth,8.0,4.3.39,MACDUFF,"Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,"
57675,57676,macbeth,8.0,4.3.40,MACDUFF,For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
57676,57677,macbeth,8.0,4.3.41,MACDUFF,"thy wrongs,"
57677,57678,macbeth,8.0,4.3.42,MACDUFF,"The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:"
57678,57679,macbeth,8.0,4.3.43,MACDUFF,I would not be the villain that thou think'st
57679,57680,macbeth,8.0,4.3.44,MACDUFF,"For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,"
57680,57681,macbeth,8.0,4.3.45,MACDUFF,And the rich East to boot.
57681,57682,macbeth,9.0,4.3.46,MALCOLM,Be not offended:
57682,57683,macbeth,9.0,4.3.47,MALCOLM,I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
57683,57684,macbeth,9.0,4.3.48,MALCOLM,"I think our country sinks beneath the yoke,"
57684,57685,macbeth,9.0,4.3.49,MALCOLM,"It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash"
57685,57686,macbeth,9.0,4.3.50,MALCOLM,Is added to her wounds: I think withal
57686,57687,macbeth,9.0,4.3.51,MALCOLM,"There would be hands uplifted in my right,"
57687,57688,macbeth,9.0,4.3.52,MALCOLM,And here from gracious England have I offer
57688,57689,macbeth,9.0,4.3.53,MALCOLM,"Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,"
57689,57690,macbeth,9.0,4.3.54,MALCOLM,"When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,"
57690,57691,macbeth,9.0,4.3.55,MALCOLM,"Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country"
57691,57692,macbeth,9.0,4.3.56,MALCOLM,"Shall have more vices than it had before,"
57692,57693,macbeth,9.0,4.3.57,MALCOLM,"More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,"
57693,57694,macbeth,9.0,4.3.58,MALCOLM,By him that shall succeed.
57694,57695,macbeth,10.0,4.3.59,MACDUFF,What should he be?
57695,57696,macbeth,11.0,4.3.60,MALCOLM,It is myself I mean: in whom I know
57696,57697,macbeth,11.0,4.3.61,MALCOLM,All the particulars of vice so grafted
57697,57698,macbeth,11.0,4.3.62,MALCOLM,"That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth"

57816,57817,macbeth,27.0,4.3.179,MALCOLM,That speak him full of grace.
57817,57818,macbeth,27.0,,MALCOLM,Enter ROSS

57826,57827,macbeth,34.0,4.3.188,ROSS,Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
57827,57828,macbeth,34.0,4.3.189,ROSS,"Be call'd our mother, but our grave, where nothing,"
57828,57829,macbeth,34.0,4.3.190,ROSS,"But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile,"
57829,57830,macbeth,34.0,4.3.191,ROSS,Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
57830,57831,macbeth,34.0,4.3.192,ROSS,"Are made, not mark'd, where violent sorrow seems"
57831,57832,macbeth,34.0,4.3.193,ROSS,"A modern ecstasy, the dead man's knell"
57832,57833,macbeth,34.0,4.3.194,ROSS,"Is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives"
57833,57834,macbeth,34.0,4.3.195,ROSS,"Expire before the flowers in their caps,"
57834,57835,macbeth,34.0,4.3.196,ROSS,Dying or ere they sicken.

57837,57838,macbeth,36.0,4.3.199,MALCOLM,What's the newest grief?
57838,57839,macbeth,37.0,4.3.200,ROSS,That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
57839,57840,macbeth,37.0,4.3.201,ROSS,Each minute teems a new one.
57840,57841,macbeth,38.0,4.3.202,MACDUFF,How does my wife?
57841,57842,macbeth,39.0,4.3.203,ROSS,"Why, well."
57842,57843,macbeth,40.0,4.3.204,MACDUFF,And all my children?
57843,57844,macbeth,41.0,4.3.205,ROSS,Well too.
57844,57845,macbeth,42.0,4.3.206,MACDUFF,The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
57845,57846,macbeth,43.0,4.3.207,ROSS,"No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em."
57846,57847,macbeth,44.0,4.3.208,MACDUFF,But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
57847,57848,macbeth,45.0,4.3.209,ROSS,"When I came hither to transport the tidings,"
57848,57849,macbeth,45.0,4.3.210,ROSS,"Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour"
57849,57850,macbeth,45.0,4.3.211,ROSS,"Of many worthy fellows that were out,"
57850,57851,macbeth,45.0,4.3.212,ROSS,"Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,"
57851,57852,macbeth,45.0,4.3.213,ROSS,For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
57852,57853,macbeth,45.0,4.3.214,ROSS,"Now is the time of help, your eye in Scotland"
57853,57854,macbeth,45.0,4.3.215,ROSS,"Would create soldiers, make our women fight,"
57854,57855,macbeth,45.0,4.3.216,ROSS,To doff their dire distresses.
57855,57856,macbeth,46.0,4.3.217,MALCOLM,Be't their comfort
57856,57857,macbeth,46.0,4.3.218,MALCOLM,We are coming thither: gracious England hath
57857,57858,macbeth,46.0,4.3.219,MALCOLM,"Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men,"
57858,57859,macbeth,46.0,4.3.220,MALCOLM,An older and a better soldier none
57859,57860,macbeth,46.0,4.3.221,MALCOLM,That Christendom gives out.
57860,57861,macbeth,47.0,4.3.222,ROSS,Would I could answer
57861,57862,macbeth,47.0,4.3.223,ROSS,This comfort with the like! But I have words
57862,57863,macbeth,47.0,4.3.224,ROSS,"That would be howl'd out in the desert air,"
57863,57864,macbeth,47.0,4.3.225,ROSS,Where hearing should not latch them.
57864,57865,macbeth,48.0,4.3.226,MACDUFF,What concern they?
57865,57866,macbeth,48.0,4.3.227,MACDUFF,The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
57866,57867,macbeth,48.0,4.3.228,MACDUFF,Due to some single breast?
57867,57868,macbeth,49.0,4.3.229,ROSS,No mind that's honest
57868,57869,macbeth,49.0,4.3.230,ROSS,"But in it shares some woe, though the main part"
57869,57870,macbeth,49.0,4.3.231,ROSS,Pertains to you alone.
57870,57871,macbeth,50.0,4.3.232,MACDUFF,"If it be mine,"

57872,57873,macbeth,51.0,4.3.234,ROSS,"Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,"
57873,57874,macbeth,51.0,4.3.235,ROSS,Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
57874,57875,macbeth,51.0,4.3.236,ROSS,That ever yet they heard.
57875,57876,macbeth,52.0,4.3.237,MACDUFF,Hum! I guess at it.
57876,57877,macbeth,53.0,4.3.238,ROSS,"Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes"
57877,57878,macbeth,53.0,4.3.239,ROSS,"Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,"
57878,57879,macbeth,53.0,4.3.240,ROSS,"Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,"
57879,57880,macbeth,53.0,4.3.241,ROSS,To add the death of you.
57880,57881,macbeth,54.0,4.3.242,MALCOLM,Merciful heaven!
57881,57882,macbeth,54.0,4.3.243,MALCOLM,"What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows,"
57882,57883,macbeth,54.0,4.3.244,MALCOLM,Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak

57884,57885,macbeth,55.0,4.3.246,MACDUFF,My children too?
57885,57886,macbeth,56.0,4.3.247,ROSS,"Wife, children, servants, all"
57886,57887,macbeth,56.0,4.3.248,ROSS,That could be found.
57887,57888,macbeth,57.0,4.3.249,MACDUFF,And I must be from thence!
57888,57889,macbeth,57.0,4.3.250,MACDUFF,My wife kill'd too?
57889,57890,macbeth,58.0,4.3.251,ROSS,I have said.

57892,57893,macbeth,59.0,4.3.254,MALCOLM,To cure this deadly grief.
57893,57894,macbeth,60.0,4.3.255,MACDUFF,He has no children. All my pretty ones?
57894,57895,macbeth,60.0,4.3.256,MACDUFF,Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
57895,57896,macbeth,60.0,4.3.257,MACDUFF,"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam"
57896,57897,macbeth,60.0,4.3.258,MACDUFF,At one fell swoop?
57897,57898,macbeth,61.0,4.3.259,MALCOLM,Dispute it like a man.

57899,57900,macbeth,62.0,4.3.261,MACDUFF,But I must also feel it as a man:

57901,57902,macbeth,62.0,4.3.263,MACDUFF,"That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,"
57902,57903,macbeth,62.0,4.3.264,MACDUFF,"And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,"
57903,57904,macbeth,62.0,4.3.265,MACDUFF,"They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,"
57904,57905,macbeth,62.0,4.3.266,MACDUFF,"Not for their own demerits, but for mine,"
57905,57906,macbeth,62.0,4.3.267,MACDUFF,Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
57906,57907,macbeth,63.0,4.3.268,MALCOLM,Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
57907,57908,macbeth,63.0,4.3.269,MALCOLM,"Convert to anger, blunt not the heart, enrage it."
57908,57909,macbeth,64.0,4.3.270,MACDUFF,"O, I could play the woman with mine eyes"
57909,57910,macbeth,64.0,4.3.271,MACDUFF,"And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,"
57910,57911,macbeth,64.0,4.3.272,MACDUFF,"Cut short all intermission, front to front"
57911,57912,macbeth,64.0,4.3.273,MACDUFF,"Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself,"
57912,57913,macbeth,64.0,4.3.274,MACDUFF,"Within my sword's length set him, if he 'scape,"
57913,57914,macbeth,64.0,4.3.275,MACDUFF,Heaven forgive him too!
57914,57915,macbeth,65.0,4.3.276,MALCOLM,This tune goes manly.
57915,57916,macbeth,65.0,4.3.277,MALCOLM,"Come, go we to the king, our power is ready,"
57916,57917,macbeth,65.0,4.3.278,MALCOLM,"Our lack is nothing but our leave, Macbeth"

57925,57926,macbeth,1.0,5.1.2,Doctor,no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
57926,57927,macbeth,2.0,5.1.3,Gentlewoman,"Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen"
57927,57928,macbeth,2.0,5.1.4,Gentlewoman,"her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon"
57928,57929,macbeth,2.0,5.1.5,Gentlewoman,"her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,"
57929,57930,macbeth,2.0,5.1.6,Gentlewoman,"write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again"
57930,57931,macbeth,2.0,5.1.7,Gentlewoman,"return to bed, yet all this while in a most fast sleep."
57931,57932,macbeth,3.0,5.1.8,Doctor,"A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once"
57932,57933,macbeth,3.0,5.1.9,Doctor,"the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of"
57933,57934,macbeth,3.0,5.1.10,Doctor,"watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her"
57934,57935,macbeth,3.0,5.1.11,Doctor,"walking and other actual performances, what, at any"
57935,57936,macbeth,3.0,5.1.12,Doctor,"time, have you heard her say?"
57936,57937,macbeth,4.0,5.1.13,Gentlewoman,"That, sir, which I will not report after her."
57937,57938,macbeth,5.0,5.1.14,Doctor,You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
57938,57939,macbeth,6.0,5.1.15,Gentlewoman,"Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to"
57939,57940,macbeth,6.0,5.1.16,Gentlewoman,confirm my speech.
57940,57941,macbeth,6.0,,Gentlewoman,"Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper"
57941,57942,macbeth,6.0,5.1.17,Gentlewoman,"Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise,"
57942,57943,macbeth,6.0,5.1.18,Gentlewoman,"and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her, stand close."
57943,57944,macbeth,7.0,5.1.19,Doctor,How came she by that light?
57944,57945,macbeth,8.0,5.1.20,Gentlewoman,"Why, it stood by her: she has light by her"
57945,57946,macbeth,8.0,5.1.21,Gentlewoman,"continually, 'tis her command."
57946,57947,macbeth,9.0,5.1.22,Doctor,"You see, her eyes are open."
57947,57948,macbeth,10.0,5.1.23,Gentlewoman,"Ay, but their sense is shut."
57948,57949,macbeth,11.0,5.1.24,Doctor,"What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands."
57949,57950,macbeth,12.0,5.1.25,Gentlewoman,"It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus"
57950,57951,macbeth,12.0,5.1.26,Gentlewoman,washing her hands: I have known her continue in
57951,57952,macbeth,12.0,5.1.27,Gentlewoman,this a quarter of an hour.
57952,57953,macbeth,13.0,5.1.28,LADY MACBETH,Yet here's a spot.
57953,57954,macbeth,14.0,5.1.29,Doctor,Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
57954,57955,macbeth,14.0,5.1.30,Doctor,"her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly."
57955,57956,macbeth,15.0,5.1.31,LADY MACBETH,"Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,"
57956,57957,macbeth,15.0,5.1.32,LADY MACBETH,"then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my"
57957,57958,macbeth,15.0,5.1.33,LADY MACBETH,"lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we"
57958,57959,macbeth,15.0,5.1.34,LADY MACBETH,"fear who knows it, when none can call our power to"
57959,57960,macbeth,15.0,5.1.35,LADY MACBETH,account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
57960,57961,macbeth,15.0,5.1.36,LADY MACBETH,to have had so much blood in him.
57961,57962,macbeth,16.0,5.1.37,Doctor,Do you mark that?
57962,57963,macbeth,17.0,5.1.38,LADY MACBETH,The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
57963,57964,macbeth,17.0,5.1.39,LADY MACBETH,"What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'"
57964,57965,macbeth,17.0,5.1.40,LADY MACBETH,"that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with"
57965,57966,macbeth,17.0,5.1.41,LADY MACBETH,this starting.
57966,57967,macbeth,18.0,5.1.42,Doctor,"Go to, go to, you have known what you should not."
57967,57968,macbeth,19.0,5.1.43,Gentlewoman,"She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of"
57968,57969,macbeth,19.0,5.1.44,Gentlewoman,that: heaven knows what she has known.
57969,57970,macbeth,20.0,5.1.45,LADY MACBETH,Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
57970,57971,macbeth,20.0,5.1.46,LADY MACBETH,perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
57971,57972,macbeth,20.0,5.1.47,LADY MACBETH,"hand. Oh, oh, oh!"
57972,57973,macbeth,21.0,5.1.48,Doctor,What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
57973,57974,macbeth,22.0,5.1.49,Gentlewoman,I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
57974,57975,macbeth,22.0,5.1.50,Gentlewoman,dignity of the whole body.
57975,57976,macbeth,23.0,5.1.51,Doctor,"Well, well, well,--"
57976,57977,macbeth,24.0,5.1.52,Gentlewoman,"Pray God it be, sir."
57977,57978,macbeth,25.0,5.1.53,Doctor,This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
57978,57979,macbeth,25.0,5.1.54,Doctor,those which have walked in their sleep who have died
57979,57980,macbeth,25.0,5.1.55,Doctor,holily in their beds.
57980,57981,macbeth,26.0,5.1.56,LADY MACBETH,"Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so"
57981,57982,macbeth,26.0,5.1.57,LADY MACBETH,"pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried, he"
57982,57983,macbeth,26.0,5.1.58,LADY MACBETH,cannot come out on's grave.
57983,57984,macbeth,27.0,5.1.59,Doctor,Even so?
57984,57985,macbeth,28.0,5.1.60,LADY MACBETH,"To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:"
57985,57986,macbeth,28.0,5.1.61,LADY MACBETH,"come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's"
57986,57987,macbeth,28.0,5.1.62,LADY MACBETH,"done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!"
57987,57988,macbeth,28.0,,LADY MACBETH,Exit
57988,57989,macbeth,29.0,5.1.63,Doctor,Will she go now to bed?
57989,57990,macbeth,30.0,5.1.64,Gentlewoman,Directly.
57990,57991,macbeth,31.0,5.1.65,Doctor,Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
57991,57992,macbeth,31.0,5.1.66,Doctor,Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
57992,57993,macbeth,31.0,5.1.67,Doctor,To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
57993,57994,macbeth,31.0,5.1.68,Doctor,More needs she the divine than the physician.
57994,57995,macbeth,31.0,5.1.69,Doctor,"God, God forgive us all! Look after her,"
57995,57996,macbeth,31.0,5.1.70,Doctor,"Remove from her the means of all annoyance,"
57996,57997,macbeth,31.0,5.1.71,Doctor,"And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:"
57997,57998,macbeth,31.0,5.1.72,Doctor,"My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight."
57998,57999,macbeth,31.0,5.1.73,Doctor,"I think, but dare not speak."
57999,58000,macbeth,32.0,5.1.74,Gentlewoman,"Good night, good doctor."

58013,58014,macbeth,4.0,5.2.11,LENNOX,And many unrough youths that even now
58014,58015,macbeth,4.0,5.2.12,LENNOX,Protest their first of manhood.

58027,58028,macbeth,7.0,5.2.25,ANGUS,Upon a dwarfish thief.

58271,58272,macbeth,13.0,,SIWARD,Enter MACBETH
58272,58273,macbeth,1.0,5.8.1,MACBETH,"Why should I play the Roman fool, and die"
58273,58274,macbeth,1.0,5.8.2,MACBETH,"On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes"
58274,58275,macbeth,1.0,5.8.3,MACBETH,Do better upon them.
58275,58276,macbeth,1.0,,MACBETH,Enter MACDUFF
58276,58277,macbeth,2.0,5.8.4,MACDUFF,"Turn, hell-hound, turn!"
58277,58278,macbeth,3.0,5.8.5,MACBETH,Of all men else I have avoided thee:
58278,58279,macbeth,3.0,5.8.6,MACBETH,"But get thee back, my soul is too much charged"
58279,58280,macbeth,3.0,5.8.7,MACBETH,With blood of thine already.
58280,58281,macbeth,4.0,5.8.8,MACDUFF,I have no words:
58281,58282,macbeth,4.0,5.8.9,MACDUFF,My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
58282,58283,macbeth,4.0,5.8.10,MACDUFF,Than terms can give thee out!
58283,58284,macbeth,4.0,,MACDUFF,They fight
58284,58285,macbeth,5.0,5.8.11,MACBETH,Thou losest labour:
58285,58286,macbeth,5.0,5.8.12,MACBETH,As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
58286,58287,macbeth,5.0,5.8.13,MACBETH,With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
58287,58288,macbeth,5.0,5.8.14,MACBETH,"Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests,"
58288,58289,macbeth,5.0,5.8.15,MACBETH,"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,"
58289,58290,macbeth,5.0,5.8.16,MACBETH,To one of woman born.
58290,58291,macbeth,6.0,5.8.17,MACDUFF,"Despair thy charm,"
58291,58292,macbeth,6.0,5.8.18,MACDUFF,And let the angel whom thou still hast served
58292,58293,macbeth,6.0,5.8.19,MACDUFF,"Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb"
58293,58294,macbeth,6.0,5.8.20,MACDUFF,Untimely ripp'd.
58294,58295,macbeth,7.0,5.8.21,MACBETH,"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,"
58295,58296,macbeth,7.0,5.8.22,MACBETH,For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
58296,58297,macbeth,7.0,5.8.23,MACBETH,"And be these juggling fiends no more believed,"
58297,58298,macbeth,7.0,5.8.24,MACBETH,"That palter with us in a double sense,"
58298,58299,macbeth,7.0,5.8.25,MACBETH,"That keep the word of promise to our ear,"
58299,58300,macbeth,7.0,5.8.26,MACBETH,And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
58300,58301,macbeth,8.0,5.8.27,MACDUFF,"Then yield thee, coward,"
58301,58302,macbeth,8.0,5.8.28,MACDUFF,And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
58302,58303,macbeth,8.0,5.8.29,MACDUFF,"We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,"
58303,58304,macbeth,8.0,5.8.30,MACDUFF,"Painted on a pole, and underwrit,"
58304,58305,macbeth,8.0,5.8.31,MACDUFF,'Here may you see the tyrant.'
58305,58306,macbeth,9.0,5.8.32,MACBETH,"I will not yield,"
58306,58307,macbeth,9.0,5.8.33,MACBETH,"To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,"
58307,58308,macbeth,9.0,5.8.34,MACBETH,And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
58308,58309,macbeth,9.0,5.8.35,MACBETH,"Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,"
58309,58310,macbeth,9.0,5.8.36,MACBETH,"And thou opposed, being of no woman born,"
58310,58311,macbeth,9.0,5.8.37,MACBETH,Yet I will try the last. Before my body
58311,58312,macbeth,9.0,5.8.38,MACBETH,"I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,"
58312,58313,macbeth,9.0,5.8.39,MACBETH,"And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'"
58313,58314,macbeth,9.0,,MACBETH,"Exeunt, fighting. Alarums"
58314,58315,macbeth,9.0,,MACBETH,"Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers"
58315,58316,macbeth,10.0,5.8.40,MALCOLM,I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
58316,58317,macbeth,11.0,5.8.41,SIWARD,"Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,"
58317,58318,macbeth,11.0,5.8.42,SIWARD,So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
58318,58319,macbeth,12.0,5.8.43,MALCOLM,"Macduff is missing, and your noble son."
58319,58320,macbeth,13.0,5.8.44,ROSS,"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:"
58320,58321,macbeth,13.0,5.8.45,ROSS,"He only lived but till he was a man,"
58321,58322,macbeth,13.0,5.8.46,ROSS,The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
58322,58323,macbeth,13.0,5.8.47,ROSS,"In the unshrinking station where he fought,"
58323,58324,macbeth,13.0,5.8.48,ROSS,But like a man he died.
58324,58325,macbeth,14.0,5.8.49,SIWARD,Then he is dead?
58325,58326,macbeth,15.0,5.8.50,ROSS,"Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow"
58326,58327,macbeth,15.0,5.8.51,ROSS,"Must not be measured by his worth, for then"
58327,58328,macbeth,15.0,5.8.52,ROSS,It hath no end.
58328,58329,macbeth,16.0,5.8.53,SIWARD,Had he his hurts before?
58329,58330,macbeth,17.0,5.8.54,ROSS,"Ay, on the front."
58330,58331,macbeth,18.0,5.8.55,SIWARD,"Why then, God's soldier be he!"
58331,58332,macbeth,18.0,5.8.56,SIWARD,"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,"
58332,58333,macbeth,18.0,5.8.57,SIWARD,I would not wish them to a fairer death:
58333,58334,macbeth,18.0,5.8.58,SIWARD,"And so, his knell is knoll'd."
58334,58335,macbeth,19.0,5.8.59,MALCOLM,"He's worth more sorrow,"
58335,58336,macbeth,19.0,5.8.60,MALCOLM,And that I'll spend for him.
58336,58337,macbeth,20.0,5.8.61,SIWARD,He's worth no more
58337,58338,macbeth,20.0,5.8.62,SIWARD,"They say he parted well, and paid his score:"
58338,58339,macbeth,20.0,5.8.63,SIWARD,"And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort."
58339,58340,macbeth,20.0,,SIWARD,"Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head"
58340,58341,macbeth,21.0,5.8.64,MACDUFF,"Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands"
58341,58342,macbeth,21.0,5.8.65,MACDUFF,The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
58342,58343,macbeth,21.0,5.8.66,MACDUFF,"I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,"
58343,58344,macbeth,21.0,5.8.67,MACDUFF,"That speak my salutation in their minds,"
58344,58345,macbeth,21.0,5.8.68,MACDUFF,Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
58345,58346,macbeth,21.0,5.8.69,MACDUFF,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
58346,58347,macbeth,22.0,5.8.70,ALL,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
58347,58348,macbeth,22.0,,ALL,Flourish
58348,58349,macbeth,23.0,5.8.71,MALCOLM,We shall not spend a large expense of time
58349,58350,macbeth,23.0,5.8.72,MALCOLM,"Before we reckon with your several loves,"
58350,58351,macbeth,23.0,5.8.73,MALCOLM,"And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,"
58351,58352,macbeth,23.0,5.8.74,MALCOLM,"Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland"
58352,58353,macbeth,23.0,5.8.75,MALCOLM,"In such an honour named. What's more to do,"
58353,58354,macbeth,23.0,5.8.76,MALCOLM,"Which would be planted newly with the time,"
58354,58355,macbeth,23.0,5.8.77,MALCOLM,As calling home our exiled friends abroad
58355,58356,macbeth,23.0,5.8.78,MALCOLM,"That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,"
58356,58357,macbeth,23.0,5.8.79,MALCOLM,Producing forth the cruel ministers
58357,58358,macbeth,23.0,5.8.80,MALCOLM,"Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,"
58358,58359,macbeth,23.0,5.8.81,MALCOLM,"Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands"
58359,58360,macbeth,23.0,5.8.82,MALCOLM,"Took off her life, this, and what needful else"
58360,58361,macbeth,23.0,5.8.83,MALCOLM,"That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,"
58361,58362,macbeth,23.0,5.8.84,MALCOLM,"We will perform in measure, time and place:"
58362,58363,macbeth,23.0,5.8.85,MALCOLM,"So, thanks to all at once and to each one,"
58363,58364,macbeth,23.0,5.8.86,MALCOLM,Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
58364,58365,macbeth,23.0,,MALCOLM,Flourish. Exeunt

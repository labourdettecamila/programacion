61363,61364,Merchant of Venice,171.0,,DUKE VINCENTIO,ACT I
61364,61365,Merchant of Venice,171.0,,DUKE VINCENTIO,SCENE I. Venice. A street.
61365,61366,Merchant of Venice,171.0,,DUKE VINCENTIO,"Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO"
61366,61367,Merchant of Venice,1.0,1.1.1,ANTONIO,"In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:"
61367,61368,Merchant of Venice,1.0,1.1.2,ANTONIO,"It wearies me, you say it wearies you,"
61368,61369,Merchant of Venice,1.0,1.1.3,ANTONIO,"But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,"
61369,61370,Merchant of Venice,1.0,1.1.4,ANTONIO,"What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,"
61370,61371,Merchant of Venice,1.0,1.1.5,ANTONIO,"I am to learn,"
61371,61372,Merchant of Venice,1.0,1.1.6,ANTONIO,"And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,"
61372,61373,Merchant of Venice,1.0,1.1.7,ANTONIO,That I have much ado to know myself.
61373,61374,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.1.8,SALARINO,"Your mind is tossing on the ocean,"
61374,61375,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.1.9,SALARINO,"There, where your argosies with portly sail,"
61375,61376,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.1.10,SALARINO,"Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,"
61376,61377,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.1.11,SALARINO,"Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,"
61377,61378,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.1.12,SALARINO,"Do overpeer the petty traffickers,"
61378,61379,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.1.13,SALARINO,"That curtsy to them, do them reverence,"
61379,61380,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.1.14,SALARINO,As they fly by them with their woven wings.
61380,61381,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.15,SALANIO,"Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,"
61381,61382,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.16,SALANIO,The better part of my affections would
61382,61383,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.17,SALANIO,Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
61383,61384,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.18,SALANIO,"Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,"
61384,61385,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.19,SALANIO,"Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads,"
61385,61386,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.20,SALANIO,And every object that might make me fear
61386,61387,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.21,SALANIO,"Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt"
61387,61388,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.1.22,SALANIO,Would make me sad.
61388,61389,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.23,SALARINO,My wind cooling my broth
61389,61390,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.24,SALARINO,"Would blow me to an ague, when I thought"
61390,61391,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.25,SALARINO,What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
61391,61392,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.26,SALARINO,"I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,"
61392,61393,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.27,SALARINO,"But I should think of shallows and of flats,"
61393,61394,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.28,SALARINO,"And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,"
61394,61395,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.29,SALARINO,Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
61395,61396,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.30,SALARINO,To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
61396,61397,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.31,SALARINO,"And see the holy edifice of stone,"
61397,61398,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.32,SALARINO,"And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,"
61398,61399,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.33,SALARINO,"Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,"
61399,61400,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.34,SALARINO,"Would scatter all her spices on the stream,"
61400,61401,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.35,SALARINO,"Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,"
61401,61402,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.36,SALARINO,"And, in a word, but even now worth this,"
61402,61403,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.37,SALARINO,And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
61403,61404,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.38,SALARINO,"To think on this, and shall I lack the thought"
61404,61405,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.39,SALARINO,That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
61405,61406,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.40,SALARINO,"But tell not me, I know, Antonio"
61406,61407,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.1.41,SALARINO,Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
61407,61408,Merchant of Venice,5.0,1.1.42,ANTONIO,"Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,"
61408,61409,Merchant of Venice,5.0,1.1.43,ANTONIO,"My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,"
61409,61410,Merchant of Venice,5.0,1.1.44,ANTONIO,"Nor to one place, nor is my whole estate"
61410,61411,Merchant of Venice,5.0,1.1.45,ANTONIO,Upon the fortune of this present year:
61411,61412,Merchant of Venice,5.0,1.1.46,ANTONIO,Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
61412,61413,Merchant of Venice,6.0,1.1.47,SALARINO,"Why, then you are in love."
61413,61414,Merchant of Venice,7.0,1.1.48,ANTONIO,"Fie, fie!"
61414,61415,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.49,SALARINO,"Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,"
61415,61416,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.50,SALARINO,Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
61416,61417,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.51,SALARINO,"For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,"
61417,61418,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.52,SALARINO,"Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,"
61418,61419,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.53,SALARINO,Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
61419,61420,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.54,SALARINO,Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
61420,61421,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.55,SALARINO,"And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,"
61421,61422,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.56,SALARINO,And other of such vinegar aspect
61422,61423,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.57,SALARINO,"That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,"
61423,61424,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.1.58,SALARINO,Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
61424,61425,Merchant of Venice,8.0,,SALARINO,"Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO"
61425,61426,Merchant of Venice,9.0,1.1.59,SALANIO,"Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,"
61426,61427,Merchant of Venice,9.0,1.1.60,SALANIO,Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
61427,61428,Merchant of Venice,9.0,1.1.61,SALANIO,We leave you now with better company.
61428,61429,Merchant of Venice,10.0,1.1.62,SALARINO,"I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,"
61429,61430,Merchant of Venice,10.0,1.1.63,SALARINO,If worthier friends had not prevented me.
61430,61431,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.1.64,ANTONIO,Your worth is very dear in my regard.
61431,61432,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.1.65,ANTONIO,"I take it, your own business calls on you"
61432,61433,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.1.66,ANTONIO,And you embrace the occasion to depart.
61433,61434,Merchant of Venice,12.0,1.1.67,SALARINO,"Good morrow, my good lords."
61434,61435,Merchant of Venice,13.0,1.1.68,BASSANIO,"Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?"
61435,61436,Merchant of Venice,13.0,1.1.69,BASSANIO,You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
61436,61437,Merchant of Venice,14.0,1.1.70,SALARINO,We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
61437,61438,Merchant of Venice,14.0,,SALARINO,Exeunt Salarino and Salanio
61438,61439,Merchant of Venice,15.0,1.1.71,LORENZO,"My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,"
61439,61440,Merchant of Venice,15.0,1.1.72,LORENZO,"We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,"
61440,61441,Merchant of Venice,15.0,1.1.73,LORENZO,"I pray you, have in mind where we must meet."
61441,61442,Merchant of Venice,16.0,1.1.74,BASSANIO,I will not fail you.
61442,61443,Merchant of Venice,17.0,1.1.75,GRATIANO,"You look not well, Signior Antonio,"
61443,61444,Merchant of Venice,17.0,1.1.76,GRATIANO,You have too much respect upon the world:
61444,61445,Merchant of Venice,17.0,1.1.77,GRATIANO,They lose it that do buy it with much care:
61445,61446,Merchant of Venice,17.0,1.1.78,GRATIANO,"Believe me, you are marvellously changed."
61446,61447,Merchant of Venice,18.0,1.1.79,ANTONIO,"I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,"
61447,61448,Merchant of Venice,18.0,1.1.80,ANTONIO,"A stage where every man must play a part,"
61448,61449,Merchant of Venice,18.0,1.1.81,ANTONIO,And mine a sad one.
61449,61450,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.82,GRATIANO,Let me play the fool:
61450,61451,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.83,GRATIANO,"With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,"
61451,61452,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.84,GRATIANO,And let my liver rather heat with wine
61452,61453,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.85,GRATIANO,Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
61453,61454,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.86,GRATIANO,"Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,"
61454,61455,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.87,GRATIANO,Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
61455,61456,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.88,GRATIANO,Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
61456,61457,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.89,GRATIANO,"By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--"
61457,61458,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.90,GRATIANO,"I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--"
61458,61459,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.91,GRATIANO,There are a sort of men whose visages
61459,61460,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.92,GRATIANO,"Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,"
61460,61461,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.93,GRATIANO,"And do a wilful stillness entertain,"
61461,61462,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.94,GRATIANO,With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
61462,61463,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.95,GRATIANO,"Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,"
61463,61464,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.96,GRATIANO,"As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,"
61464,61465,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.97,GRATIANO,And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
61465,61466,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.98,GRATIANO,"O my Antonio, I do know of these"
61466,61467,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.99,GRATIANO,That therefore only are reputed wise
61467,61468,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.100,GRATIANO,"For saying nothing, when, I am very sure,"
61468,61469,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.101,GRATIANO,"If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,"
61469,61470,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.102,GRATIANO,"Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools."
61470,61471,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.103,GRATIANO,I'll tell thee more of this another time:
61471,61472,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.104,GRATIANO,"But fish not, with this melancholy bait,"
61472,61473,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.105,GRATIANO,"For this fool gudgeon, this opinion."
61473,61474,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.106,GRATIANO,"Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:"
61474,61475,Merchant of Venice,19.0,1.1.107,GRATIANO,I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
61475,61476,Merchant of Venice,20.0,1.1.108,LORENZO,"Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:"
61476,61477,Merchant of Venice,20.0,1.1.109,LORENZO,"I must be one of these same dumb wise men,"
61477,61478,Merchant of Venice,20.0,1.1.110,LORENZO,For Gratiano never lets me speak.
61478,61479,Merchant of Venice,21.0,1.1.111,GRATIANO,"Well, keep me company but two years moe,"
61479,61480,Merchant of Venice,21.0,1.1.112,GRATIANO,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
61480,61481,Merchant of Venice,22.0,1.1.113,ANTONIO,Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
61481,61482,Merchant of Venice,23.0,1.1.114,GRATIANO,"Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable"
61482,61483,Merchant of Venice,23.0,1.1.115,GRATIANO,In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
61483,61484,Merchant of Venice,23.0,,GRATIANO,Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO
61484,61485,Merchant of Venice,24.0,1.1.116,ANTONIO,Is that any thing now?
61485,61486,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.1.117,BASSANIO,"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more"
61486,61487,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.1.118,BASSANIO,than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
61487,61488,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.1.119,BASSANIO,grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
61488,61489,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.1.120,BASSANIO,"shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you"
61489,61490,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.1.121,BASSANIO,"have them, they are not worth the search."
61490,61491,Merchant of Venice,26.0,1.1.122,ANTONIO,"Well, tell me now what lady is the same"
61491,61492,Merchant of Venice,26.0,1.1.123,ANTONIO,"To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,"
61492,61493,Merchant of Venice,26.0,1.1.124,ANTONIO,That you to-day promised to tell me of?
61493,61494,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.125,BASSANIO,"'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,"
61494,61495,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.126,BASSANIO,"How much I have disabled mine estate,"
61495,61496,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.127,BASSANIO,By something showing a more swelling port
61496,61497,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.128,BASSANIO,Than my faint means would grant continuance:
61497,61498,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.129,BASSANIO,Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
61498,61499,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.130,BASSANIO,"From such a noble rate, but my chief care"
61499,61500,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.131,BASSANIO,Is to come fairly off from the great debts
61500,61501,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.132,BASSANIO,Wherein my time something too prodigal
61501,61502,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.133,BASSANIO,"Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,"
61502,61503,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.134,BASSANIO,"I owe the most, in money and in love,"
61503,61504,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.135,BASSANIO,And from your love I have a warranty
61504,61505,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.136,BASSANIO,To unburden all my plots and purposes
61505,61506,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.1.137,BASSANIO,How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
61506,61507,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.1.138,ANTONIO,"I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it,"
61507,61508,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.1.139,ANTONIO,"And if it stand, as you yourself still do,"
61508,61509,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.1.140,ANTONIO,"Within the eye of honour, be assured,"
61509,61510,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.1.141,ANTONIO,"My purse, my person, my extremest means,"
61510,61511,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.1.142,ANTONIO,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
61511,61512,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.143,BASSANIO,"In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,"
61512,61513,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.144,BASSANIO,I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
61513,61514,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.145,BASSANIO,"The self-same way with more advised watch,"
61514,61515,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.146,BASSANIO,"To find the other forth, and by adventuring both"
61515,61516,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.147,BASSANIO,"I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,"
61516,61517,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.148,BASSANIO,Because what follows is pure innocence.
61517,61518,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.149,BASSANIO,"I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,"
61518,61519,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.150,BASSANIO,"That which I owe is lost, but if you please"
61519,61520,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.151,BASSANIO,To shoot another arrow that self way
61520,61521,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.152,BASSANIO,"Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,"
61521,61522,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.153,BASSANIO,"As I will watch the aim, or to find both"
61522,61523,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.154,BASSANIO,Or bring your latter hazard back again
61523,61524,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.1.155,BASSANIO,And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
61524,61525,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.156,ANTONIO,"You know me well, and herein spend but time"
61525,61526,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.157,ANTONIO,"To wind about my love with circumstance,"
61526,61527,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.158,ANTONIO,And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
61527,61528,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.159,ANTONIO,In making question of my uttermost
61528,61529,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.160,ANTONIO,Than if you had made waste of all I have:
61529,61530,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.161,ANTONIO,Then do but say to me what I should do
61530,61531,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.162,ANTONIO,"That in your knowledge may by me be done,"
61531,61532,Merchant of Venice,30.0,1.1.163,ANTONIO,"And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak."
61532,61533,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.164,BASSANIO,"In Belmont is a lady richly left,"
61533,61534,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.165,BASSANIO,"And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,"
61534,61535,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.166,BASSANIO,Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
61535,61536,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.167,BASSANIO,I did receive fair speechless messages:
61536,61537,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.168,BASSANIO,"Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued"
61537,61538,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.169,BASSANIO,"To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:"
61538,61539,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.170,BASSANIO,"Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,"
61539,61540,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.171,BASSANIO,For the four winds blow in from every coast
61540,61541,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.172,BASSANIO,"Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks"
61541,61542,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.173,BASSANIO,"Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,"

61543,61544,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.175,BASSANIO,And many Jasons come in quest of her.

61547,61548,Merchant of Venice,31.0,1.1.179,BASSANIO,That I should questionless be fortunate!

61552,61553,Merchant of Venice,32.0,1.1.184,ANTONIO,"That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,"
61553,61554,Merchant of Venice,32.0,1.1.185,ANTONIO,"To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia."
61554,61555,Merchant of Venice,32.0,1.1.186,ANTONIO,"Go, presently inquire, and so will I,"

61559,61560,Merchant of Venice,32.0,,ANTONIO,Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
61560,61561,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.1.190,PORTIA,"By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of"
61561,61562,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.1.191,PORTIA,this great world.
61562,61563,Merchant of Venice,34.0,1.1.192,NERISSA,"You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in"
61563,61564,Merchant of Venice,34.0,1.1.193,NERISSA,the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
61564,61565,Merchant of Venice,34.0,1.1.194,NERISSA,"yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit"
61565,61566,Merchant of Venice,34.0,1.1.195,NERISSA,with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
61566,61567,Merchant of Venice,34.0,1.1.196,NERISSA,"is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the"
61567,61568,Merchant of Venice,34.0,1.1.197,NERISSA,"mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but"
61568,61569,Merchant of Venice,34.0,1.1.198,NERISSA,competency lives longer.
61569,61570,Merchant of Venice,35.0,1.1.199,PORTIA,Good sentences and well pronounced.
61570,61571,Merchant of Venice,36.0,1.1.200,NERISSA,"They would be better, if well followed."
61571,61572,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.201,PORTIA,If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
61572,61573,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.202,PORTIA,"do, chapels had been churches and poor men's"
61573,61574,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.203,PORTIA,cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
61574,61575,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.204,PORTIA,follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
61575,61576,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.205,PORTIA,"twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the"
61576,61577,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.206,PORTIA,twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
61577,61578,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.207,PORTIA,"devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps"
61578,61579,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.208,PORTIA,o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
61579,61580,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.209,PORTIA,"youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the"
61580,61581,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.210,PORTIA,cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
61581,61582,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.211,PORTIA,"choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may"
61582,61583,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.212,PORTIA,neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
61583,61584,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.213,PORTIA,"dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curbed"
61584,61585,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.214,PORTIA,"by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,"
61585,61586,Merchant of Venice,37.0,1.1.215,PORTIA,"Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?"
61586,61587,Merchant of Venice,38.0,1.1.216,NERISSA,"Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their"

61589,61590,Merchant of Venice,38.0,1.1.219,NERISSA,"silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning"
61590,61591,Merchant of Venice,38.0,1.1.220,NERISSA,"chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any"
61591,61592,Merchant of Venice,38.0,1.1.221,NERISSA,rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
61592,61593,Merchant of Venice,38.0,1.1.222,NERISSA,warmth is there in your affection towards any of
61593,61594,Merchant of Venice,38.0,1.1.223,NERISSA,these princely suitors that are already come?
61594,61595,Merchant of Venice,39.0,1.1.224,PORTIA,"I pray thee, over-name them, and as thou namest"
61595,61596,Merchant of Venice,39.0,1.1.225,PORTIA,"them, I will describe them, and, according to my"
61596,61597,Merchant of Venice,39.0,1.1.226,PORTIA,"description, level at my affection."
61597,61598,Merchant of Venice,40.0,1.1.227,NERISSA,"First, there is the Neapolitan prince."
61598,61599,Merchant of Venice,41.0,1.1.228,PORTIA,"Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but"
61599,61600,Merchant of Venice,41.0,1.1.229,PORTIA,"talk of his horse, and he makes it a great"
61600,61601,Merchant of Venice,41.0,1.1.230,PORTIA,"appropriation to his own good parts, that he can"
61601,61602,Merchant of Venice,41.0,1.1.231,PORTIA,shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
61602,61603,Merchant of Venice,41.0,1.1.232,PORTIA,mother played false with a smith.
61603,61604,Merchant of Venice,42.0,1.1.233,NERISSA,Then there is the County Palatine.
61604,61605,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.234,PORTIA,"He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you"
61605,61606,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.235,PORTIA,"will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and"
61606,61607,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.236,PORTIA,smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
61607,61608,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.237,PORTIA,"philosopher when he grows old, being so full of"
61608,61609,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.238,PORTIA,unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
61609,61610,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.239,PORTIA,married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
61610,61611,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.240,PORTIA,than to either of these. God defend me from these
61611,61612,Merchant of Venice,43.0,1.1.241,PORTIA,two!
61612,61613,Merchant of Venice,44.0,1.1.242,NERISSA,"How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?"
61613,61614,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.243,PORTIA,"God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man."
61614,61615,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.244,PORTIA,"In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,"
61615,61616,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.245,PORTIA,"he! why, he hath a horse better than the"
61616,61617,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.246,PORTIA,"Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than"
61617,61618,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.247,PORTIA,"the Count Palatine, he is every man in no man, if a"
61618,61619,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.248,PORTIA,"throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will"
61619,61620,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.249,PORTIA,"fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I"
61620,61621,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.250,PORTIA,should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
61621,61622,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.251,PORTIA,"I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I"
61622,61623,Merchant of Venice,45.0,1.1.252,PORTIA,shall never requite him.
61623,61624,Merchant of Venice,46.0,1.1.253,NERISSA,"What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron"
61624,61625,Merchant of Venice,46.0,1.1.254,NERISSA,of England?
61625,61626,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.255,PORTIA,"You know I say nothing to him, for he understands"
61626,61627,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.256,PORTIA,"not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,"
61627,61628,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.257,PORTIA,"nor Italian, and you will come into the court and"
61628,61629,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.258,PORTIA,swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
61629,61630,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.259,PORTIA,"He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can"
61630,61631,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.260,PORTIA,converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
61631,61632,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.261,PORTIA,"I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round"
61632,61633,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.262,PORTIA,"hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his"
61633,61634,Merchant of Venice,47.0,1.1.263,PORTIA,behavior every where.
61634,61635,Merchant of Venice,48.0,1.1.264,NERISSA,"What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?"
61635,61636,Merchant of Venice,49.0,1.1.265,PORTIA,"That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he"
61636,61637,Merchant of Venice,49.0,1.1.266,PORTIA,borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
61637,61638,Merchant of Venice,49.0,1.1.267,PORTIA,swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
61638,61639,Merchant of Venice,49.0,1.1.268,PORTIA,think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
61639,61640,Merchant of Venice,49.0,1.1.269,PORTIA,under for another.
61640,61641,Merchant of Venice,50.0,1.1.270,NERISSA,"How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?"
61641,61642,Merchant of Venice,51.0,1.1.271,PORTIA,"Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and"
61642,61643,Merchant of Venice,51.0,1.1.272,PORTIA,"most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when"
61643,61644,Merchant of Venice,51.0,1.1.273,PORTIA,"he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and"
61644,61645,Merchant of Venice,51.0,1.1.274,PORTIA,"when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:"
61645,61646,Merchant of Venice,51.0,1.1.275,PORTIA,"and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall"
61646,61647,Merchant of Venice,51.0,1.1.276,PORTIA,make shift to go without him.
61647,61648,Merchant of Venice,52.0,1.1.277,NERISSA,"If he should offer to choose, and choose the right"
61648,61649,Merchant of Venice,52.0,1.1.278,NERISSA,"casket, you should refuse to perform your father's"

61650,61651,Merchant of Venice,53.0,1.1.280,PORTIA,"Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a"

61652,61653,Merchant of Venice,53.0,1.1.282,PORTIA,for if the devil be within and that temptation
61653,61654,Merchant of Venice,53.0,1.1.283,PORTIA,"without, I know he will choose it. I will do any"
61654,61655,Merchant of Venice,53.0,1.1.284,PORTIA,"thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge."
61655,61656,Merchant of Venice,54.0,1.1.285,NERISSA,"You need not fear, lady, the having any of these"
61656,61657,Merchant of Venice,54.0,1.1.286,NERISSA,lords: they have acquainted me with their
61657,61658,Merchant of Venice,54.0,1.1.287,NERISSA,"determinations, which is, indeed, to return to their"
61658,61659,Merchant of Venice,54.0,1.1.288,NERISSA,"home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless"
61659,61660,Merchant of Venice,54.0,1.1.289,NERISSA,you may be won by some other sort than your father's
61660,61661,Merchant of Venice,54.0,1.1.290,NERISSA,imposition depending on the caskets.

61663,61664,Merchant of Venice,55.0,1.1.293,PORTIA,of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
61664,61665,Merchant of Venice,55.0,1.1.294,PORTIA,"are so reasonable, for there is not one among them"
61665,61666,Merchant of Venice,55.0,1.1.295,PORTIA,"but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant"
61666,61667,Merchant of Venice,55.0,1.1.296,PORTIA,them a fair departure.
61667,61668,Merchant of Venice,56.0,1.1.297,NERISSA,"Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a"
61668,61669,Merchant of Venice,56.0,1.1.298,NERISSA,"Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither"
61669,61670,Merchant of Venice,56.0,1.1.299,NERISSA,in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
61670,61671,Merchant of Venice,57.0,1.1.300,PORTIA,"Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, he was so called."
61671,61672,Merchant of Venice,58.0,1.1.301,NERISSA,"True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish"
61672,61673,Merchant of Venice,58.0,1.1.302,NERISSA,"eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady."
61673,61674,Merchant of Venice,59.0,1.1.303,PORTIA,"I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of"
61674,61675,Merchant of Venice,59.0,1.1.304,PORTIA,thy praise.
61675,61676,Merchant of Venice,59.0,,PORTIA,Enter a Serving-man

61677,61678,Merchant of Venice,60.0,1.1.306,Servant,"The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take"
61678,61679,Merchant of Venice,60.0,1.1.307,Servant,their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
61679,61680,Merchant of Venice,60.0,1.1.308,Servant,"fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the"
61680,61681,Merchant of Venice,60.0,1.1.309,Servant,prince his master will be here to-night.
61681,61682,Merchant of Venice,61.0,1.1.310,PORTIA,If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
61682,61683,Merchant of Venice,61.0,1.1.311,PORTIA,"heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should"
61683,61684,Merchant of Venice,61.0,1.1.312,PORTIA,be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
61684,61685,Merchant of Venice,61.0,1.1.313,PORTIA,"of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had"
61685,61686,Merchant of Venice,61.0,1.1.314,PORTIA,"rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,"
61686,61687,Merchant of Venice,61.0,1.1.315,PORTIA,"Nerissa. Sirrah, go before."
61687,61688,Merchant of Venice,61.0,1.1.316,PORTIA,Whiles we shut the gates

61693,61694,Merchant of Venice,2.0,1.3.2,BASSANIO,"Ay, sir, for three months."
61694,61695,Merchant of Venice,3.0,1.3.3,SHYLOCK,"For three months, well."
61695,61696,Merchant of Venice,4.0,1.3.4,BASSANIO,"For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound."
61696,61697,Merchant of Venice,5.0,1.3.5,SHYLOCK,"Antonio shall become bound, well."
61697,61698,Merchant of Venice,6.0,1.3.6,BASSANIO,May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
61698,61699,Merchant of Venice,6.0,1.3.7,BASSANIO,know your answer?
61699,61700,Merchant of Venice,7.0,1.3.8,SHYLOCK,Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
61700,61701,Merchant of Venice,8.0,1.3.9,BASSANIO,Your answer to that.
61701,61702,Merchant of Venice,9.0,1.3.10,SHYLOCK,Antonio is a good man.
61702,61703,Merchant of Venice,10.0,1.3.11,BASSANIO,Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
61703,61704,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.12,SHYLOCK,"Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a"
61704,61705,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.13,SHYLOCK,good man is to have you understand me that he is
61705,61706,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.14,SHYLOCK,sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
61706,61707,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.15,SHYLOCK,"hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the"
61707,61708,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.16,SHYLOCK,"Indies, I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he"
61708,61709,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.17,SHYLOCK,"hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and"
61709,61710,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.18,SHYLOCK,"other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships"
61710,61711,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.19,SHYLOCK,"are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats"
61711,61712,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.20,SHYLOCK,"and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I"
61712,61713,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.21,SHYLOCK,"mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,"
61713,61714,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.22,SHYLOCK,"winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,"
61714,61715,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.23,SHYLOCK,"sufficient. Three thousand ducats, I think I may"
61715,61716,Merchant of Venice,11.0,1.3.24,SHYLOCK,take his bond.
61716,61717,Merchant of Venice,12.0,1.3.25,BASSANIO,Be assured you may.
61717,61718,Merchant of Venice,13.0,1.3.26,SHYLOCK,"I will be assured I may, and, that I may be assured,"
61718,61719,Merchant of Venice,13.0,1.3.27,SHYLOCK,I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?

61730,61731,Merchant of Venice,17.0,1.3.38,SHYLOCK,But more for that in low simplicity

61734,61735,Merchant of Venice,17.0,1.3.42,SHYLOCK,I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.

61753,61754,Merchant of Venice,20.0,1.3.60,ANTONIO,"Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,"
61754,61755,Merchant of Venice,20.0,1.3.61,ANTONIO,I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd

61762,61763,Merchant of Venice,24.0,1.3.69,ANTONIO,I do never use it.
61763,61764,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.3.70,SHYLOCK,When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
61764,61765,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.3.71,SHYLOCK,"This Jacob from our holy Abram was,"
61765,61766,Merchant of Venice,25.0,1.3.72,SHYLOCK,"As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,"

61769,61770,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.76,SHYLOCK,Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
61770,61771,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.77,SHYLOCK,When Laban and himself were compromised
61771,61772,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.78,SHYLOCK,That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
61772,61773,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.79,SHYLOCK,"Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,"
61773,61774,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.80,SHYLOCK,"In the end of autumn turned to the rams,"
61774,61775,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.81,SHYLOCK,"And, when the work of generation was"
61775,61776,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.82,SHYLOCK,"Between these woolly breeders in the act,"
61776,61777,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.83,SHYLOCK,"The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,"
61777,61778,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.84,SHYLOCK,"And, in the doing of the deed of kind,"
61778,61779,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.85,SHYLOCK,"He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,"
61779,61780,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.86,SHYLOCK,Who then conceiving did in eaning time
61780,61781,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.87,SHYLOCK,"Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's."

61782,61783,Merchant of Venice,27.0,1.3.89,SHYLOCK,"And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not."
61783,61784,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.3.90,ANTONIO,"This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for,"
61784,61785,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.3.91,ANTONIO,"A thing not in his power to bring to pass,"
61785,61786,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.3.92,ANTONIO,But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
61786,61787,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.3.93,ANTONIO,Was this inserted to make interest good?
61787,61788,Merchant of Venice,28.0,1.3.94,ANTONIO,Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
61788,61789,Merchant of Venice,29.0,1.3.95,SHYLOCK,"I cannot tell, I make it breed as fast:"

61803,61804,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.110,SHYLOCK,For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
61804,61805,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.111,SHYLOCK,"You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,"
61805,61806,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.112,SHYLOCK,"And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,"
61806,61807,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.113,SHYLOCK,And all for use of that which is mine own.
61807,61808,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.114,SHYLOCK,"Well then, it now appears you need my help:"
61808,61809,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.115,SHYLOCK,"Go to, then, you come to me, and you say"
61809,61810,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.116,SHYLOCK,"'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so,"
61810,61811,Merchant of Venice,33.0,1.3.117,SHYLOCK,"You, that did void your rheum upon my beard"

62270,62271,Merchant of Venice,14.0,2.5.51,SHYLOCK,"His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in,"
62271,62272,Merchant of Venice,14.0,2.5.52,SHYLOCK,Perhaps I will return immediately:

62283,62284,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.6.3,SALARINO,His hour is almost past.
62284,62285,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.6.4,GRATIANO,"And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,"
62285,62286,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.6.5,GRATIANO,For lovers ever run before the clock.
62286,62287,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.6.6,SALARINO,"O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly"

62294,62295,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.6.14,GRATIANO,Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
62295,62296,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.6.15,GRATIANO,How like a younker or a prodigal
62296,62297,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.6.16,GRATIANO,"The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,"
62297,62298,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.6.17,GRATIANO,Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!

62316,62317,Merchant of Venice,12.0,2.6.34,JESSICA,"Here, catch this casket, it is worth the pains."
62317,62318,Merchant of Venice,12.0,2.6.35,JESSICA,"I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,"
62318,62319,Merchant of Venice,12.0,2.6.36,JESSICA,For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
62319,62320,Merchant of Venice,12.0,2.6.37,JESSICA,But love is blind and lovers cannot see
62320,62321,Merchant of Venice,12.0,2.6.38,JESSICA,"The pretty follies that themselves commit,"
62321,62322,Merchant of Venice,12.0,2.6.39,JESSICA,"For if they could, Cupid himself would blush"
62322,62323,Merchant of Venice,12.0,2.6.40,JESSICA,To see me thus transformed to a boy.
62323,62324,Merchant of Venice,13.0,2.6.41,LORENZO,"Descend, for you must be my torchbearer."
62324,62325,Merchant of Venice,14.0,2.6.42,JESSICA,"What, must I hold a candle to my shames?"
62325,62326,Merchant of Venice,14.0,2.6.43,JESSICA,"They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light."
62326,62327,Merchant of Venice,14.0,2.6.44,JESSICA,"Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,"
62327,62328,Merchant of Venice,14.0,2.6.45,JESSICA,And I should be obscured.
62328,62329,Merchant of Venice,15.0,2.6.46,LORENZO,"So are you, sweet,"
62329,62330,Merchant of Venice,15.0,2.6.47,LORENZO,Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
62330,62331,Merchant of Venice,15.0,2.6.48,LORENZO,"But come at once,"
62331,62332,Merchant of Venice,15.0,2.6.49,LORENZO,"For the close night doth play the runaway,"
62332,62333,Merchant of Venice,15.0,2.6.50,LORENZO,And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
62333,62334,Merchant of Venice,16.0,2.6.51,JESSICA,"I will make fast the doors, and gild myself"
62334,62335,Merchant of Venice,16.0,2.6.52,JESSICA,"With some more ducats, and be with you straight."

62338,62339,Merchant of Venice,18.0,2.6.55,LORENZO,"For she is wise, if I can judge of her,"
62339,62340,Merchant of Venice,18.0,2.6.56,LORENZO,"And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,"
62340,62341,Merchant of Venice,18.0,2.6.57,LORENZO,"And true she is, as she hath proved herself,"
62341,62342,Merchant of Venice,18.0,2.6.58,LORENZO,"And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,"
62342,62343,Merchant of Venice,18.0,2.6.59,LORENZO,Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
62343,62344,Merchant of Venice,18.0,,LORENZO,"Enter JESSICA, below"
62344,62345,Merchant of Venice,18.0,2.6.60,LORENZO,"What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away!"
62345,62346,Merchant of Venice,18.0,2.6.61,LORENZO,Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

62350,62351,Merchant of Venice,21.0,2.6.64,ANTONIO,"Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?"
62351,62352,Merchant of Venice,21.0,2.6.65,ANTONIO,'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.

62353,62354,Merchant of Venice,21.0,2.6.67,ANTONIO,Bassanio presently will go aboard:
62354,62355,Merchant of Venice,21.0,2.6.68,ANTONIO,I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
62355,62356,Merchant of Venice,22.0,2.6.69,GRATIANO,I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
62356,62357,Merchant of Venice,22.0,2.6.70,GRATIANO,Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

62359,62360,Merchant of Venice,22.0,,GRATIANO,"Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains"
62360,62361,Merchant of Venice,1.0,2.7.1,PORTIA,Go draw aside the curtains and discover
62361,62362,Merchant of Venice,1.0,2.7.2,PORTIA,The several caskets to this noble prince.
62362,62363,Merchant of Venice,1.0,2.7.3,PORTIA,Now make your choice.
62363,62364,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.7.4,MOROCCO,"The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,"
62364,62365,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.7.5,MOROCCO,"'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire,'"
62365,62366,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.7.6,MOROCCO,"The second, silver, which this promise carries,"
62366,62367,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.7.7,MOROCCO,"'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves,'"
62367,62368,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.7.8,MOROCCO,"This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,"
62368,62369,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.7.9,MOROCCO,'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
62369,62370,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.7.10,MOROCCO,How shall I know if I do choose the right?
62370,62371,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.7.11,PORTIA,"The one of them contains my picture, prince:"
62371,62372,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.7.12,PORTIA,"If you choose that, then I am yours withal."
62372,62373,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.13,MOROCCO,"Some god direct my judgment! Let me see,"
62373,62374,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.14,MOROCCO,I will survey the inscriptions back again.
62374,62375,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.15,MOROCCO,What says this leaden casket?
62375,62376,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.16,MOROCCO,'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
62376,62377,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.17,MOROCCO,Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
62377,62378,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.18,MOROCCO,This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
62378,62379,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.19,MOROCCO,Do it in hope of fair advantages:
62379,62380,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.20,MOROCCO,"A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross,"
62380,62381,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.21,MOROCCO,I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
62381,62382,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.22,MOROCCO,What says the silver with her virgin hue?
62382,62383,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.23,MOROCCO,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
62383,62384,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.24,MOROCCO,"As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,"
62384,62385,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.25,MOROCCO,And weigh thy value with an even hand:
62385,62386,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.26,MOROCCO,"If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,"
62386,62387,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.27,MOROCCO,"Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough"
62387,62388,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.28,MOROCCO,May not extend so far as to the lady:
62388,62389,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.29,MOROCCO,And yet to be afeard of my deserving
62389,62390,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.30,MOROCCO,Were but a weak disabling of myself.
62390,62391,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.31,MOROCCO,"As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:"
62391,62392,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.32,MOROCCO,"I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,"
62392,62393,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.33,MOROCCO,"In graces and in qualities of breeding,"
62393,62394,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.34,MOROCCO,"But more than these, in love I do deserve."
62394,62395,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.35,MOROCCO,"What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?"
62395,62396,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.36,MOROCCO,Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
62396,62397,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.37,MOROCCO,'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
62397,62398,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.38,MOROCCO,"Why, that's the lady, all the world desires her,"
62398,62399,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.39,MOROCCO,"From the four corners of the earth they come,"
62399,62400,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.40,MOROCCO,"To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:"
62400,62401,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.41,MOROCCO,The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
62401,62402,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.42,MOROCCO,Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
62402,62403,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.43,MOROCCO,For princes to come view fair Portia:
62403,62404,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.44,MOROCCO,"The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head"
62404,62405,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.45,MOROCCO,"Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar"
62405,62406,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.46,MOROCCO,"To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,"
62406,62407,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.47,MOROCCO,"As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia."
62407,62408,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.48,MOROCCO,One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
62408,62409,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.49,MOROCCO,Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
62409,62410,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.50,MOROCCO,To think so base a thought: it were too gross
62410,62411,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.51,MOROCCO,To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
62411,62412,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.52,MOROCCO,"Or shall I think in silver she's immured,"
62412,62413,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.53,MOROCCO,Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
62413,62414,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.54,MOROCCO,O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
62414,62415,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.55,MOROCCO,Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
62415,62416,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.56,MOROCCO,A coin that bears the figure of an angel
62416,62417,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.57,MOROCCO,"Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon,"
62417,62418,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.58,MOROCCO,But here an angel in a golden bed
62418,62419,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.59,MOROCCO,Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
62419,62420,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.7.60,MOROCCO,"Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!"
62420,62421,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.7.61,PORTIA,"There, take it, prince, and if my form lie there,"
62421,62422,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.7.62,PORTIA,Then I am yours.
62422,62423,Merchant of Venice,5.0,,PORTIA,He unlocks the golden casket
62423,62424,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.63,MOROCCO,O hell! what have we here?
62424,62425,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.64,MOROCCO,"A carrion Death, within whose empty eye"
62425,62426,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.65,MOROCCO,There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
62426,62427,Merchant of Venice,6.0,,MOROCCO,Reads
62427,62428,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.66,MOROCCO,"All that glitters is not gold,"
62428,62429,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.67,MOROCCO,Often have you heard that told:
62429,62430,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.68,MOROCCO,Many a man his life hath sold
62430,62431,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.69,MOROCCO,But my outside to behold:
62431,62432,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.70,MOROCCO,Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
62432,62433,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.71,MOROCCO,"Had you been as wise as bold,"
62433,62434,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.72,MOROCCO,"Young in limbs, in judgment old,"
62434,62435,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.73,MOROCCO,Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
62435,62436,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.74,MOROCCO,"Fare you well, your suit is cold."
62436,62437,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.75,MOROCCO,"Cold, indeed, and labour lost:"
62437,62438,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.76,MOROCCO,"Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!"
62438,62439,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.77,MOROCCO,"Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart"
62439,62440,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.7.78,MOROCCO,To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
62440,62441,Merchant of Venice,6.0,,MOROCCO,Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets
62441,62442,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.7.79,PORTIA,"A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go."
62442,62443,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.7.80,PORTIA,Let all of his complexion choose me so.
62443,62444,Merchant of Venice,7.0,,PORTIA,Exeunt
62444,62445,Merchant of Venice,7.0,,PORTIA,SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.
62445,62446,Merchant of Venice,7.0,,PORTIA,Enter SALARINO and SALANIO
62446,62447,Merchant of Venice,1.0,2.8.1,SALARINO,"Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:"
62447,62448,Merchant of Venice,1.0,2.8.2,SALARINO,"With him is Gratiano gone along,"
62448,62449,Merchant of Venice,1.0,2.8.3,SALARINO,And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
62449,62450,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.8.4,SALANIO,"The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,"
62450,62451,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.8.5,SALANIO,Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
62451,62452,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.8.6,SALARINO,"He came too late, the ship was under sail:"
62452,62453,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.8.7,SALARINO,But there the duke was given to understand
62453,62454,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.8.8,SALARINO,That in a gondola were seen together
62454,62455,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.8.9,SALARINO,Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
62455,62456,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.8.10,SALARINO,"Besides, Antonio certified the duke"
62456,62457,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.8.11,SALARINO,They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
62457,62458,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.12,SALANIO,"I never heard a passion so confused,"
62458,62459,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.13,SALANIO,"So strange, outrageous, and so variable,"
62459,62460,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.14,SALANIO,As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
62460,62461,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.15,SALANIO,'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
62461,62462,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.16,SALANIO,Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!

62463,62464,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.18,SALANIO,"A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,"
62464,62465,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.19,SALANIO,"Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!"
62465,62466,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.20,SALANIO,"And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,"
62466,62467,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.21,SALANIO,"Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl,"
62467,62468,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.8.22,SALANIO,"She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'"
62468,62469,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.8.23,SALARINO,"Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,"
62469,62470,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.8.24,SALARINO,"Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats."
62470,62471,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.8.25,SALANIO,"Let good Antonio look he keep his day,"
62471,62472,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.8.26,SALANIO,Or he shall pay for this.
62472,62473,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.8.27,SALARINO,"Marry, well remember'd."
62473,62474,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.8.28,SALARINO,"I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,"
62474,62475,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.8.29,SALARINO,"Who told me, in the narrow seas that part"
62475,62476,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.8.30,SALARINO,"The French and English, there miscarried"
62476,62477,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.8.31,SALARINO,A vessel of our country richly fraught:
62477,62478,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.8.32,SALARINO,"I thought upon Antonio when he told me,"
62478,62479,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.8.33,SALARINO,And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
62479,62480,Merchant of Venice,8.0,2.8.34,SALANIO,"You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,"
62480,62481,Merchant of Venice,8.0,2.8.35,SALANIO,"Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him."
62481,62482,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.36,SALARINO,A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
62482,62483,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.37,SALARINO,I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
62483,62484,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.38,SALARINO,Bassanio told him he would make some speed
62484,62485,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.39,SALARINO,"Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so,"
62485,62486,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.40,SALARINO,"Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio"
62486,62487,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.41,SALARINO,"But stay the very riping of the time,"
62487,62488,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.42,SALARINO,"And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,"
62488,62489,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.43,SALARINO,Let it not enter in your mind of love:
62489,62490,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.44,SALARINO,"Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts"
62490,62491,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.45,SALARINO,To courtship and such fair ostents of love
62491,62492,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.46,SALARINO,As shall conveniently become you there:'
62492,62493,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.47,SALARINO,"And even there, his eye being big with tears,"
62493,62494,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.48,SALARINO,"Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,"
62494,62495,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.49,SALARINO,And with affection wondrous sensible
62495,62496,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.8.50,SALARINO,"He wrung Bassanio's hand, and so they parted."
62496,62497,Merchant of Venice,10.0,2.8.51,SALANIO,I think he only loves the world for him.
62497,62498,Merchant of Venice,10.0,2.8.52,SALANIO,"I pray thee, let us go and find him out"
62498,62499,Merchant of Venice,10.0,2.8.53,SALANIO,And quicken his embraced heaviness
62499,62500,Merchant of Venice,10.0,2.8.54,SALANIO,With some delight or other.
62500,62501,Merchant of Venice,11.0,2.8.55,SALARINO,Do we so.

62506,62507,Merchant of Venice,1.0,2.9.3,NERISSA,And comes to his election presently.
62507,62508,Merchant of Venice,1.0,,NERISSA,"Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains"
62508,62509,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.9.4,PORTIA,"Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:"
62509,62510,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.9.5,PORTIA,"If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,"
62510,62511,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.9.6,PORTIA,Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
62511,62512,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.9.7,PORTIA,"But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,"
62512,62513,Merchant of Venice,2.0,2.9.8,PORTIA,You must be gone from hence immediately.
62513,62514,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.9.9,ARRAGON,I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
62514,62515,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.9.10,ARRAGON,"First, never to unfold to any one"
62515,62516,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.9.11,ARRAGON,"Which casket 'twas I chose, next, if I fail"
62516,62517,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.9.12,ARRAGON,"Of the right casket, never in my life"
62517,62518,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.9.13,ARRAGON,"To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,"
62518,62519,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.9.14,ARRAGON,"If I do fail in fortune of my choice,"
62519,62520,Merchant of Venice,3.0,2.9.15,ARRAGON,Immediately to leave you and be gone.
62520,62521,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.9.16,PORTIA,To these injunctions every one doth swear
62521,62522,Merchant of Venice,4.0,2.9.17,PORTIA,That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
62522,62523,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.18,ARRAGON,And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
62523,62524,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.19,ARRAGON,"To my heart's hope! Gold, silver, and base lead."
62524,62525,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.20,ARRAGON,'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
62525,62526,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.21,ARRAGON,"You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard."
62526,62527,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.22,ARRAGON,What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
62527,62528,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.23,ARRAGON,'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
62528,62529,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.24,ARRAGON,What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
62529,62530,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.25,ARRAGON,"By the fool multitude, that choose by show,"
62530,62531,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.26,ARRAGON,"Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,"
62531,62532,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.27,ARRAGON,"Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,"
62532,62533,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.28,ARRAGON,"Builds in the weather on the outward wall,"
62533,62534,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.29,ARRAGON,Even in the force and road of casualty.
62534,62535,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.30,ARRAGON,"I will not choose what many men desire,"
62535,62536,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.31,ARRAGON,Because I will not jump with common spirits
62536,62537,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.32,ARRAGON,And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
62537,62538,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.33,ARRAGON,"Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house,"
62538,62539,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.34,ARRAGON,Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
62539,62540,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.35,ARRAGON,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
62540,62541,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.36,ARRAGON,"And well said too, for who shall go about"
62541,62542,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.37,ARRAGON,To cozen fortune and be honourable
62542,62543,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.38,ARRAGON,Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
62543,62544,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.39,ARRAGON,To wear an undeserved dignity.
62544,62545,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.40,ARRAGON,"O, that estates, degrees and offices"
62545,62546,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.41,ARRAGON,"Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour"
62546,62547,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.42,ARRAGON,Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
62547,62548,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.43,ARRAGON,How many then should cover that stand bare!
62548,62549,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.44,ARRAGON,How many be commanded that command!
62549,62550,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.45,ARRAGON,How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
62550,62551,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.46,ARRAGON,From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
62551,62552,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.47,ARRAGON,Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
62552,62553,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.48,ARRAGON,"To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:"
62553,62554,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.49,ARRAGON,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
62554,62555,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.50,ARRAGON,"I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,"
62555,62556,Merchant of Venice,5.0,2.9.51,ARRAGON,And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
62556,62557,Merchant of Venice,5.0,,ARRAGON,He opens the silver casket
62557,62558,Merchant of Venice,6.0,2.9.52,PORTIA,Too long a pause for that which you find there.
62558,62559,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.9.53,ARRAGON,"What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,"
62559,62560,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.9.54,ARRAGON,Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
62560,62561,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.9.55,ARRAGON,How much unlike art thou to Portia!
62561,62562,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.9.56,ARRAGON,How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
62562,62563,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.9.57,ARRAGON,'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
62563,62564,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.9.58,ARRAGON,Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
62564,62565,Merchant of Venice,7.0,2.9.59,ARRAGON,Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
62565,62566,Merchant of Venice,8.0,2.9.60,PORTIA,"To offend, and judge, are distinct offices"
62566,62567,Merchant of Venice,8.0,2.9.61,PORTIA,And of opposed natures.
62567,62568,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.62,ARRAGON,What is here?

62571,62572,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.65,ARRAGON,That did never choose amiss.
62572,62573,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.66,ARRAGON,"Some there be that shadows kiss,"
62573,62574,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.67,ARRAGON,Such have but a shadow's bliss:

62576,62577,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.70,ARRAGON,"Take what wife you will to bed,"
62577,62578,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.71,ARRAGON,I will ever be your head:
62578,62579,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.72,ARRAGON,So be gone: you are sped.
62579,62580,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.73,ARRAGON,Still more fool I shall appear
62580,62581,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.74,ARRAGON,By the time I linger here
62581,62582,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.75,ARRAGON,"With one fool's head I came to woo,"
62582,62583,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.76,ARRAGON,But I go away with two.
62583,62584,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.77,ARRAGON,"Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,"
62584,62585,Merchant of Venice,9.0,2.9.78,ARRAGON,Patiently to bear my wroth.
62585,62586,Merchant of Venice,9.0,,ARRAGON,Exeunt Arragon and train
62586,62587,Merchant of Venice,10.0,2.9.79,PORTIA,Thus hath the candle singed the moth.

62623,62624,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.1.9,SALANIO,knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
62624,62625,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.1.10,SALANIO,wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
62625,62626,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.1.11,SALANIO,"true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the"

62628,62629,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.1.14,SALANIO,to keep his name company!--
62629,62630,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.1.15,SALARINO,"Come, the full stop."
62630,62631,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.1.16,SALANIO,"Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath"
62631,62632,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.1.17,SALANIO,lost a ship.
62632,62633,Merchant of Venice,6.0,3.1.18,SALARINO,I would it might prove the end of his losses.

62637,62638,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.1.22,SHYLOCK,"You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my"
62638,62639,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.1.23,SHYLOCK,daughter's flight.
62639,62640,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.1.24,SALARINO,"That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor"
62640,62641,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.1.25,SALARINO,that made the wings she flew withal.
62641,62642,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.1.26,SALANIO,"And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was"
62642,62643,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.1.27,SALANIO,"fledged, and then it is the complexion of them all"
62643,62644,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.1.28,SALANIO,to leave the dam.
62644,62645,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.1.29,SHYLOCK,She is damned for it.
62645,62646,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.1.30,SALANIO,"That's certain, if the devil may be her judge."
62646,62647,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.1.31,SHYLOCK,My own flesh and blood to rebel!

62648,62649,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.1.33,SHYLOCK,"I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood."
62649,62650,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.1.34,SALARINO,There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
62650,62651,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.1.35,SALARINO,"than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods"
62651,62652,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.1.36,SALARINO,than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
62652,62653,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.1.37,SALARINO,"tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any"
62653,62654,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.1.38,SALARINO,loss at sea or no?

62660,62661,Merchant of Venice,17.0,3.1.45,SHYLOCK,look to his bond.
62661,62662,Merchant of Venice,18.0,3.1.46,SALARINO,"Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take"
62662,62663,Merchant of Venice,18.0,3.1.47,SALARINO,his flesh: what's that good for?
62663,62664,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.1.48,SHYLOCK,"To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,"
62664,62665,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.1.49,SHYLOCK,"it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and"
62665,62666,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.1.50,SHYLOCK,"hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses,"
62666,62667,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.1.51,SHYLOCK,"mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my"

62679,62680,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.1.64,SHYLOCK,what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian

62681,62682,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.1.66,SHYLOCK,"Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you"

62693,62694,Merchant of Venice,23.0,3.1.75,SHYLOCK,found my daughter?

62712,62713,Merchant of Venice,28.0,3.1.94,TUBAL,"Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis."
62713,62714,Merchant of Venice,29.0,3.1.95,SHYLOCK,"I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?"
62714,62715,Merchant of Venice,30.0,3.1.96,TUBAL,I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
62715,62716,Merchant of Venice,31.0,3.1.97,SHYLOCK,"I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!"
62716,62717,Merchant of Venice,31.0,3.1.98,SHYLOCK,"ha, ha! where? in Genoa?"
62717,62718,Merchant of Venice,32.0,3.1.99,TUBAL,"Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one"

62721,62722,Merchant of Venice,33.0,3.1.103,SHYLOCK,fourscore ducats!
62722,62723,Merchant of Venice,34.0,3.1.104,TUBAL,There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
62723,62724,Merchant of Venice,34.0,3.1.105,TUBAL,"company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break."
62724,62725,Merchant of Venice,35.0,3.1.106,SHYLOCK,"I am very glad of it: I'll plague him, I'll torture"
62725,62726,Merchant of Venice,35.0,3.1.107,SHYLOCK,him: I am glad of it.
62726,62727,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.1.108,TUBAL,One of them showed me a ring that he had of your

62728,62729,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.1.110,SHYLOCK,"Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my"

62730,62731,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.1.112,SHYLOCK,I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
62731,62732,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.1.113,TUBAL,But Antonio is certainly undone.
62732,62733,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.1.114,SHYLOCK,"Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee"
62733,62734,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.1.115,SHYLOCK,"me an officer, bespeak him a fortnight before. I"
62734,62735,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.1.116,SHYLOCK,"will have the heart of him, if he forfeit, for, were"

62736,62737,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.1.118,SHYLOCK,"will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue,"
62737,62738,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.1.119,SHYLOCK,"go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal."
62738,62739,Merchant of Venice,39.0,,SHYLOCK,Exeunt

62740,62741,Merchant of Venice,39.0,,SHYLOCK,"Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants"
62741,62742,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.1,PORTIA,"I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two"
62742,62743,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.2,PORTIA,"Before you hazard, for, in choosing wrong,"
62743,62744,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.3,PORTIA,I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
62744,62745,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.4,PORTIA,"There's something tells me, but it is not love,"
62745,62746,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.5,PORTIA,"I would not lose you, and you know yourself,"
62746,62747,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.6,PORTIA,Hate counsels not in such a quality.
62747,62748,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.7,PORTIA,"But lest you should not understand me well,--"
62748,62749,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.8,PORTIA,"And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--"
62749,62750,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.9,PORTIA,I would detain you here some month or two
62750,62751,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.10,PORTIA,Before you venture for me. I could teach you
62751,62752,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.11,PORTIA,"How to choose right, but I am then forsworn,"
62752,62753,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.12,PORTIA,"So will I never be: so may you miss me,"
62753,62754,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.13,PORTIA,"But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,"
62754,62755,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.14,PORTIA,"That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,"
62755,62756,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.15,PORTIA,"They have o'erlook'd me and divided me,"
62756,62757,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.16,PORTIA,"One half of me is yours, the other half yours,"
62757,62758,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.17,PORTIA,"Mine own, I would say, but if mine, then yours,"
62758,62759,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.18,PORTIA,"And so all yours. O, these naughty times"
62759,62760,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.19,PORTIA,Put bars between the owners and their rights!
62760,62761,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.20,PORTIA,"And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,"

62762,62763,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.22,PORTIA,"I speak too long, but 'tis to peize the time,"
62763,62764,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.23,PORTIA,"To eke it and to draw it out in length,"
62764,62765,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.2.24,PORTIA,To stay you from election.
62765,62766,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.2.25,BASSANIO,Let me choose
62766,62767,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.2.26,BASSANIO,"For as I am, I live upon the rack."

62768,62769,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.2.28,PORTIA,What treason there is mingled with your love.
62769,62770,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.2.29,BASSANIO,"None but that ugly treason of mistrust,"
62770,62771,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.2.30,BASSANIO,Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
62771,62772,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.2.31,BASSANIO,There may as well be amity and life
62772,62773,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.2.32,BASSANIO,"'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love."
62773,62774,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.2.33,PORTIA,"Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,"
62774,62775,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.2.34,PORTIA,Where men enforced do speak anything.
62775,62776,Merchant of Venice,6.0,3.2.35,BASSANIO,"Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth."
62776,62777,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.2.36,PORTIA,"Well then, confess and live."
62777,62778,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.2.37,BASSANIO,'Confess' and 'love'
62778,62779,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.2.38,BASSANIO,Had been the very sum of my confession:
62779,62780,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.2.39,BASSANIO,"O happy torment, when my torturer"
62780,62781,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.2.40,BASSANIO,Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
62781,62782,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.2.41,BASSANIO,But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
62782,62783,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.42,PORTIA,"Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:"
62783,62784,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.43,PORTIA,"If you do love me, you will find me out."
62784,62785,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.44,PORTIA,"Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof."
62785,62786,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.45,PORTIA,"Let music sound while he doth make his choice,"
62786,62787,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.46,PORTIA,"Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,"
62787,62788,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.47,PORTIA,Fading in music: that the comparison
62788,62789,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.48,PORTIA,"May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream"
62789,62790,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.49,PORTIA,"And watery death-bed for him. He may win,"
62790,62791,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.50,PORTIA,And what is music then? Then music is
62791,62792,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.51,PORTIA,Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
62792,62793,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.52,PORTIA,To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
62793,62794,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.53,PORTIA,As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
62794,62795,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.54,PORTIA,"That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,"
62795,62796,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.55,PORTIA,"And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,"
62796,62797,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.56,PORTIA,"With no less presence, but with much more love,"
62797,62798,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.57,PORTIA,"Than young Alcides, when he did redeem"
62798,62799,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.58,PORTIA,The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
62799,62800,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.59,PORTIA,To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
62800,62801,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.60,PORTIA,"The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,"
62801,62802,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.61,PORTIA,"With bleared visages, come forth to view"
62802,62803,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.62,PORTIA,"The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!"
62803,62804,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.63,PORTIA,"Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay"
62804,62805,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.64,PORTIA,I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
62805,62806,Merchant of Venice,9.0,,PORTIA,"Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself"
62806,62807,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.65,PORTIA,SONG.
62807,62808,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.66,PORTIA,"Tell me where is fancy bred,"
62808,62809,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.67,PORTIA,"Or in the heart, or in the head?"
62809,62810,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.68,PORTIA,"How begot, how nourished?"
62810,62811,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.69,PORTIA,"Reply, reply."
62811,62812,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.70,PORTIA,"It is engender'd in the eyes,"
62812,62813,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.71,PORTIA,"With gazing fed, and fancy dies"
62813,62814,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.72,PORTIA,In the cradle where it lies.
62814,62815,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.73,PORTIA,Let us all ring fancy's knell
62815,62816,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.2.74,PORTIA,"I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell."
62816,62817,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.2.75,ALL,"Ding, dong, bell."
62817,62818,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.76,BASSANIO,So may the outward shows be least themselves:
62818,62819,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.77,BASSANIO,The world is still deceived with ornament.
62819,62820,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.78,BASSANIO,"In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,"
62820,62821,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.79,BASSANIO,"But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,"
62821,62822,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.80,BASSANIO,"Obscures the show of evil? In religion,"
62822,62823,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.81,BASSANIO,"What damned error, but some sober brow"
62823,62824,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.82,BASSANIO,"Will bless it and approve it with a text,"
62824,62825,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.83,BASSANIO,Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
62825,62826,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.84,BASSANIO,There is no vice so simple but assumes
62826,62827,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.85,BASSANIO,Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
62827,62828,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.86,BASSANIO,"How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false"
62828,62829,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.87,BASSANIO,"As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins"
62829,62830,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.88,BASSANIO,"The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,"
62830,62831,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.89,BASSANIO,"Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk,"
62831,62832,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.90,BASSANIO,And these assume but valour's excrement
62832,62833,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.91,BASSANIO,"To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,"
62833,62834,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.92,BASSANIO,"And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight,"
62834,62835,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.93,BASSANIO,"Which therein works a miracle in nature,"
62835,62836,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.94,BASSANIO,Making them lightest that wear most of it:
62836,62837,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.95,BASSANIO,So are those crisped snaky golden locks
62837,62838,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.96,BASSANIO,"Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,"
62838,62839,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.97,BASSANIO,"Upon supposed fairness, often known"
62839,62840,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.98,BASSANIO,"To be the dowry of a second head,"
62840,62841,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.99,BASSANIO,The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
62841,62842,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.100,BASSANIO,Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
62842,62843,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.101,BASSANIO,"To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf"
62843,62844,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.102,BASSANIO,"Veiling an Indian beauty, in a word,"
62844,62845,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.103,BASSANIO,The seeming truth which cunning times put on
62845,62846,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.104,BASSANIO,"To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,"
62846,62847,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.105,BASSANIO,"Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,"
62847,62848,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.106,BASSANIO,"Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge"
62848,62849,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.107,BASSANIO,"'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,"
62849,62850,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.108,BASSANIO,"Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,"
62850,62851,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.109,BASSANIO,"Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,"
62851,62852,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.2.110,BASSANIO,"And here choose I, joy be the consequence!"
62852,62853,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.2.111,PORTIA,"[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,"
62853,62854,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.2.112,PORTIA,"As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,"
62854,62855,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.2.113,PORTIA,"And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,"
62855,62856,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.2.114,PORTIA,"Be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,"
62856,62857,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.2.115,PORTIA,"In measure rein thy joy, scant this excess."
62857,62858,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.2.116,PORTIA,"I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,"
62858,62859,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.2.117,PORTIA,For fear I surfeit.
62859,62860,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.118,BASSANIO,What find I here?
62860,62861,Merchant of Venice,13.0,,BASSANIO,Opening the leaden casket
62861,62862,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.119,BASSANIO,Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
62862,62863,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.120,BASSANIO,Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
62863,62864,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.121,BASSANIO,"Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,"
62864,62865,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.122,BASSANIO,"Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,"
62865,62866,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.123,BASSANIO,Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
62866,62867,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.124,BASSANIO,Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
62867,62868,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.125,BASSANIO,The painter plays the spider and hath woven
62868,62869,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.126,BASSANIO,"A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,"
62869,62870,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.127,BASSANIO,"Faster than gnats in cobwebs, but her eyes,--"
62870,62871,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.128,BASSANIO,"How could he see to do them? having made one,"
62871,62872,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.129,BASSANIO,Methinks it should have power to steal both his
62872,62873,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.130,BASSANIO,"And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far"
62873,62874,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.131,BASSANIO,The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
62874,62875,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.132,BASSANIO,"In underprizing it, so far this shadow"
62875,62876,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.133,BASSANIO,"Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,"
62876,62877,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.134,BASSANIO,The continent and summary of my fortune.
62877,62878,Merchant of Venice,13.0,,BASSANIO,Reads
62878,62879,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.135,BASSANIO,"You that choose not by the view,"
62879,62880,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.136,BASSANIO,Chance as fair and choose as true!
62880,62881,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.137,BASSANIO,"Since this fortune falls to you,"
62881,62882,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.138,BASSANIO,"Be content and seek no new,"
62882,62883,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.139,BASSANIO,If you be well pleased with this
62883,62884,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.140,BASSANIO,"And hold your fortune for your bliss,"
62884,62885,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.141,BASSANIO,Turn you where your lady is
62885,62886,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.142,BASSANIO,And claim her with a loving kiss.
62886,62887,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.143,BASSANIO,"A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave,"
62887,62888,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.144,BASSANIO,"I come by note, to give and to receive."
62888,62889,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.145,BASSANIO,"Like one of two contending in a prize,"
62889,62890,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.146,BASSANIO,"That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,"
62890,62891,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.147,BASSANIO,"Hearing applause and universal shout,"
62891,62892,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.148,BASSANIO,"Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt"
62892,62893,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.149,BASSANIO,"Whether these pearls of praise be his or no,"
62893,62894,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.150,BASSANIO,"So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so,"
62894,62895,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.151,BASSANIO,"As doubtful whether what I see be true,"
62895,62896,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.2.152,BASSANIO,"Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you."
62896,62897,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.153,PORTIA,"You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,"
62897,62898,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.154,PORTIA,Such as I am: though for myself alone
62898,62899,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.155,PORTIA,"I would not be ambitious in my wish,"
62899,62900,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.156,PORTIA,"To wish myself much better, yet, for you"
62900,62901,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.157,PORTIA,"I would be trebled twenty times myself,"
62901,62902,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.158,PORTIA,"A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,"
62902,62903,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.159,PORTIA,"That only to stand high in your account,"
62903,62904,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.160,PORTIA,"I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,"
62904,62905,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.161,PORTIA,"Exceed account, but the full sum of me"
62905,62906,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.162,PORTIA,"Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,"
62906,62907,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.163,PORTIA,"Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised,"
62907,62908,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.164,PORTIA,"Happy in this, she is not yet so old"
62908,62909,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.165,PORTIA,"But she may learn, happier than this,"
62909,62910,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.166,PORTIA,"She is not bred so dull but she can learn,"
62910,62911,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.167,PORTIA,Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
62911,62912,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.168,PORTIA,"Commits itself to yours to be directed,"
62912,62913,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.169,PORTIA,"As from her lord, her governor, her king."
62913,62914,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.170,PORTIA,Myself and what is mine to you and yours
62914,62915,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.171,PORTIA,Is now converted: but now I was the lord
62915,62916,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.172,PORTIA,"Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,"
62916,62917,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.173,PORTIA,"Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,"
62917,62918,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.174,PORTIA,"This house, these servants and this same myself"
62918,62919,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.175,PORTIA,"Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring,"
62919,62920,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.176,PORTIA,"Which when you part from, lose, or give away,"
62920,62921,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.177,PORTIA,Let it presage the ruin of your love
62921,62922,Merchant of Venice,14.0,3.2.178,PORTIA,And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
62922,62923,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.179,BASSANIO,"Madam, you have bereft me of all words,"
62923,62924,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.180,BASSANIO,"Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,"
62924,62925,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.181,BASSANIO,"And there is such confusion in my powers,"
62925,62926,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.182,BASSANIO,As after some oration fairly spoke
62926,62927,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.183,BASSANIO,"By a beloved prince, there doth appear"
62927,62928,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.184,BASSANIO,"Among the buzzing pleased multitude,"
62928,62929,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.185,BASSANIO,"Where every something, being blent together,"
62929,62930,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.186,BASSANIO,"Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,"
62930,62931,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.187,BASSANIO,Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
62931,62932,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.188,BASSANIO,"Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:"
62932,62933,Merchant of Venice,15.0,3.2.189,BASSANIO,"O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!"
62933,62934,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.2.190,NERISSA,"My lord and lady, it is now our time,"
62934,62935,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.2.191,NERISSA,"That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,"
62935,62936,Merchant of Venice,16.0,3.2.192,NERISSA,"To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!"
62936,62937,Merchant of Venice,17.0,3.2.193,GRATIANO,"My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,"
62937,62938,Merchant of Venice,17.0,3.2.194,GRATIANO,"I wish you all the joy that you can wish,"
62938,62939,Merchant of Venice,17.0,3.2.195,GRATIANO,For I am sure you can wish none from me:
62939,62940,Merchant of Venice,17.0,3.2.196,GRATIANO,And when your honours mean to solemnize
62940,62941,Merchant of Venice,17.0,3.2.197,GRATIANO,"The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,"
62941,62942,Merchant of Venice,17.0,3.2.198,GRATIANO,Even at that time I may be married too.
62942,62943,Merchant of Venice,18.0,3.2.199,BASSANIO,"With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife."
62943,62944,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.200,GRATIANO,"I thank your lordship, you have got me one."
62944,62945,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.201,GRATIANO,"My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:"
62945,62946,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.202,GRATIANO,"You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid,"
62946,62947,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.203,GRATIANO,"You loved, I loved for intermission."
62947,62948,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.204,GRATIANO,"No more pertains to me, my lord, than you."
62948,62949,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.205,GRATIANO,"Your fortune stood upon the casket there,"
62949,62950,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.206,GRATIANO,"And so did mine too, as the matter falls,"
62950,62951,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.207,GRATIANO,"For wooing here until I sweat again,"
62951,62952,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.208,GRATIANO,And sweating until my very roof was dry
62952,62953,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.209,GRATIANO,"With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,"
62953,62954,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.210,GRATIANO,I got a promise of this fair one here
62954,62955,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.211,GRATIANO,"To have her love, provided that your fortune"
62955,62956,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.2.212,GRATIANO,Achieved her mistress.
62956,62957,Merchant of Venice,20.0,3.2.213,PORTIA,"Is this true, Nerissa?"
62957,62958,Merchant of Venice,21.0,3.2.214,NERISSA,"Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal."
62958,62959,Merchant of Venice,22.0,3.2.215,BASSANIO,"And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?"
62959,62960,Merchant of Venice,23.0,3.2.216,GRATIANO,"Yes, faith, my lord."
62960,62961,Merchant of Venice,24.0,3.2.217,BASSANIO,Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
62961,62962,Merchant of Venice,25.0,3.2.218,GRATIANO,We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
62962,62963,Merchant of Venice,26.0,3.2.219,NERISSA,"What, and stake down?"
62963,62964,Merchant of Venice,27.0,3.2.220,GRATIANO,"No, we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down."
62964,62965,Merchant of Venice,27.0,3.2.221,GRATIANO,"But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,"
62965,62966,Merchant of Venice,27.0,3.2.222,GRATIANO,and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
62966,62967,Merchant of Venice,27.0,,GRATIANO,"Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice"
62967,62968,Merchant of Venice,28.0,3.2.223,BASSANIO,"Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,"
62968,62969,Merchant of Venice,28.0,3.2.224,BASSANIO,If that the youth of my new interest here
62969,62970,Merchant of Venice,28.0,3.2.225,BASSANIO,"Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,"
62970,62971,Merchant of Venice,28.0,3.2.226,BASSANIO,"I bid my very friends and countrymen,"
62971,62972,Merchant of Venice,28.0,3.2.227,BASSANIO,"Sweet Portia, welcome."
62972,62973,Merchant of Venice,29.0,3.2.228,PORTIA,"So do I, my lord:"
62973,62974,Merchant of Venice,29.0,3.2.229,PORTIA,They are entirely welcome.
62974,62975,Merchant of Venice,30.0,3.2.230,LORENZO,"I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,"
62975,62976,Merchant of Venice,30.0,3.2.231,LORENZO,"My purpose was not to have seen you here,"
62976,62977,Merchant of Venice,30.0,3.2.232,LORENZO,"But meeting with Salerio by the way,"
62977,62978,Merchant of Venice,30.0,3.2.233,LORENZO,"He did entreat me, past all saying nay,"
62978,62979,Merchant of Venice,30.0,3.2.234,LORENZO,To come with him along.
62979,62980,Merchant of Venice,31.0,3.2.235,SALERIO,"I did, my lord,"
62980,62981,Merchant of Venice,31.0,3.2.236,SALERIO,And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
62981,62982,Merchant of Venice,31.0,3.2.237,SALERIO,Commends him to you.
62982,62983,Merchant of Venice,31.0,,SALERIO,Gives Bassanio a letter
62983,62984,Merchant of Venice,32.0,3.2.238,BASSANIO,"Ere I ope his letter,"
62984,62985,Merchant of Venice,32.0,3.2.239,BASSANIO,"I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth."
62985,62986,Merchant of Venice,33.0,3.2.240,SALERIO,"Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,"
62986,62987,Merchant of Venice,33.0,3.2.241,SALERIO,"Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there"
62987,62988,Merchant of Venice,33.0,3.2.242,SALERIO,Will show you his estate.
62988,62989,Merchant of Venice,34.0,3.2.243,GRATIANO,"Nerissa, cheer yon stranger, bid her welcome."
62989,62990,Merchant of Venice,34.0,3.2.244,GRATIANO,"Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?"
62990,62991,Merchant of Venice,34.0,3.2.245,GRATIANO,"How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?"
62991,62992,Merchant of Venice,34.0,3.2.246,GRATIANO,"I know he will be glad of our success,"
62992,62993,Merchant of Venice,34.0,3.2.247,GRATIANO,"We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece."
62993,62994,Merchant of Venice,35.0,3.2.248,SALERIO,I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
62994,62995,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.249,PORTIA,"There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,"
62995,62996,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.250,PORTIA,That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
62996,62997,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.251,PORTIA,"Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world"
62997,62998,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.252,PORTIA,Could turn so much the constitution
62998,62999,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.253,PORTIA,"Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!"
62999,63000,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.254,PORTIA,"With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,"
63000,63001,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.255,PORTIA,And I must freely have the half of anything
63001,63002,Merchant of Venice,36.0,3.2.256,PORTIA,That this same paper brings you.
63002,63003,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.257,BASSANIO,"O sweet Portia,"
63003,63004,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.258,BASSANIO,Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
63004,63005,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.259,BASSANIO,"That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,"
63005,63006,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.260,BASSANIO,"When I did first impart my love to you,"
63006,63007,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.261,BASSANIO,"I freely told you, all the wealth I had"
63007,63008,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.262,BASSANIO,"Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman,"
63008,63009,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.263,BASSANIO,"And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,"
63009,63010,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.264,BASSANIO,"Rating myself at nothing, you shall see"
63010,63011,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.265,BASSANIO,How much I was a braggart. When I told you
63011,63012,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.266,BASSANIO,"My state was nothing, I should then have told you"
63012,63013,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.267,BASSANIO,"That I was worse than nothing, for, indeed,"
63013,63014,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.268,BASSANIO,"I have engaged myself to a dear friend,"
63014,63015,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.269,BASSANIO,"Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,"
63015,63016,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.270,BASSANIO,"To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,"
63016,63017,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.271,BASSANIO,"The paper as the body of my friend,"
63017,63018,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.272,BASSANIO,"And every word in it a gaping wound,"
63018,63019,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.273,BASSANIO,"Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?"
63019,63020,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.274,BASSANIO,"Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?"
63020,63021,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.275,BASSANIO,"From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,"
63021,63022,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.276,BASSANIO,"From Lisbon, Barbary and India?"
63022,63023,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.277,BASSANIO,And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
63023,63024,Merchant of Venice,37.0,3.2.278,BASSANIO,Of merchant-marring rocks?
63024,63025,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.279,SALERIO,"Not one, my lord."
63025,63026,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.280,SALERIO,"Besides, it should appear, that if he had"
63026,63027,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.281,SALERIO,"The present money to discharge the Jew,"
63027,63028,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.282,SALERIO,He would not take it. Never did I know
63028,63029,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.283,SALERIO,"A creature, that did bear the shape of man,"
63029,63030,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.284,SALERIO,So keen and greedy to confound a man:
63030,63031,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.285,SALERIO,"He plies the duke at morning and at night,"
63031,63032,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.286,SALERIO,"And doth impeach the freedom of the state,"
63032,63033,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.287,SALERIO,"If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,"
63033,63034,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.288,SALERIO,"The duke himself, and the magnificoes"
63034,63035,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.289,SALERIO,"Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him,"
63035,63036,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.290,SALERIO,But none can drive him from the envious plea
63036,63037,Merchant of Venice,38.0,3.2.291,SALERIO,"Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond."
63037,63038,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.2.292,JESSICA,When I was with him I have heard him swear
63038,63039,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.2.293,JESSICA,"To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,"
63039,63040,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.2.294,JESSICA,That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
63040,63041,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.2.295,JESSICA,Than twenty times the value of the sum
63041,63042,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.2.296,JESSICA,"That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,"
63042,63043,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.2.297,JESSICA,"If law, authority and power deny not,"
63043,63044,Merchant of Venice,39.0,3.2.298,JESSICA,It will go hard with poor Antonio.
63044,63045,Merchant of Venice,40.0,3.2.299,PORTIA,Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
63045,63046,Merchant of Venice,41.0,3.2.300,BASSANIO,"The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,"
63046,63047,Merchant of Venice,41.0,3.2.301,BASSANIO,The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
63047,63048,Merchant of Venice,41.0,3.2.302,BASSANIO,"In doing courtesies, and one in whom"
63048,63049,Merchant of Venice,41.0,3.2.303,BASSANIO,The ancient Roman honour more appears
63049,63050,Merchant of Venice,41.0,3.2.304,BASSANIO,Than any that draws breath in Italy.
63050,63051,Merchant of Venice,42.0,3.2.305,PORTIA,What sum owes he the Jew?
63051,63052,Merchant of Venice,43.0,3.2.306,BASSANIO,For me three thousand ducats.
63052,63053,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.307,PORTIA,"What, no more?"
63053,63054,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.308,PORTIA,"Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond,"
63054,63055,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.309,PORTIA,"Double six thousand, and then treble that,"
63055,63056,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.310,PORTIA,Before a friend of this description
63056,63057,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.311,PORTIA,Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
63057,63058,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.312,PORTIA,"First go with me to church and call me wife,"
63058,63059,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.313,PORTIA,"And then away to Venice to your friend,"
63059,63060,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.314,PORTIA,For never shall you lie by Portia's side
63060,63061,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.315,PORTIA,With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
63061,63062,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.316,PORTIA,To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
63062,63063,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.317,PORTIA,"When it is paid, bring your true friend along."
63063,63064,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.318,PORTIA,My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
63064,63065,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.319,PORTIA,"Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!"
63065,63066,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.320,PORTIA,For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
63066,63067,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.321,PORTIA,"Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:"
63067,63068,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.322,PORTIA,"Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear."
63068,63069,Merchant of Venice,44.0,3.2.323,PORTIA,But let me hear the letter of your friend.
63069,63070,Merchant of Venice,45.0,3.2.324,BASSANIO,"[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all"
63070,63071,Merchant of Venice,45.0,3.2.325,BASSANIO,"miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is"
63071,63072,Merchant of Venice,45.0,3.2.326,BASSANIO,"very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since"
63072,63073,Merchant of Venice,45.0,3.2.327,BASSANIO,"in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all"
63073,63074,Merchant of Venice,45.0,3.2.328,BASSANIO,"debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but"
63074,63075,Merchant of Venice,45.0,3.2.329,BASSANIO,"see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your"

63076,63077,Merchant of Venice,45.0,3.2.331,BASSANIO,let not my letter.
63077,63078,Merchant of Venice,46.0,3.2.332,PORTIA,"O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!"
63078,63079,Merchant of Venice,47.0,3.2.333,BASSANIO,"Since I have your good leave to go away,"
63079,63080,Merchant of Venice,47.0,3.2.334,BASSANIO,"I will make haste: but, till I come again,"
63080,63081,Merchant of Venice,47.0,3.2.335,BASSANIO,"No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,"
63081,63082,Merchant of Venice,47.0,3.2.336,BASSANIO,No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

63086,63087,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.3.2,SHYLOCK,This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
63087,63088,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.3.3,SHYLOCK,"Gaoler, look to him."
63088,63089,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.3.4,ANTONIO,"Hear me yet, good Shylock."

63090,63091,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.3.6,SHYLOCK,I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.

63094,63095,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.3.10,SHYLOCK,"Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond"
63095,63096,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.3.11,SHYLOCK,To come abroad with him at his request.
63096,63097,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.3.12,ANTONIO,"I pray thee, hear me speak."

63106,63107,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.3.21,ANTONIO,Let him alone:
63107,63108,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.3.22,ANTONIO,I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
63108,63109,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.3.23,ANTONIO,"He seeks my life, his reason well I know:"

63111,63112,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.3.26,ANTONIO,Therefore he hates me.
63112,63113,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.3.27,SALARINO,I am sure the duke
63113,63114,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.3.28,SALARINO,Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
63114,63115,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.29,ANTONIO,The duke cannot deny the course of law:
63115,63116,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.30,ANTONIO,For the commodity that strangers have

63117,63118,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.32,ANTONIO,"Will much impeach the justice of his state,"
63118,63119,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.33,ANTONIO,Since that the trade and profit of the city
63119,63120,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.34,ANTONIO,"Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:"
63120,63121,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.35,ANTONIO,"These griefs and losses have so bated me,"
63121,63122,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.36,ANTONIO,That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
63122,63123,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.37,ANTONIO,To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
63123,63124,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.38,ANTONIO,"Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come"
63124,63125,Merchant of Venice,9.0,3.3.39,ANTONIO,"To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!"

63133,63134,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.4.6,LORENZO,"How true a gentleman you send relief,"
63134,63135,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.4.7,LORENZO,"How dear a lover of my lord your husband,"
63135,63136,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.4.8,LORENZO,I know you would be prouder of the work
63136,63137,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.4.9,LORENZO,Than customary bounty can enforce you.
63137,63138,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.10,PORTIA,"I never did repent for doing good,"
63138,63139,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.11,PORTIA,Nor shall not now: for in companions

63143,63144,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.16,PORTIA,"Which makes me think that this Antonio,"
63144,63145,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.17,PORTIA,"Being the bosom lover of my lord,"
63145,63146,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.18,PORTIA,"Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,"
63146,63147,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.19,PORTIA,How little is the cost I have bestow'd
63147,63148,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.20,PORTIA,In purchasing the semblance of my soul
63148,63149,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.21,PORTIA,From out the state of hellish misery!
63149,63150,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.22,PORTIA,"This comes too near the praising of myself,"
63150,63151,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.23,PORTIA,Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
63151,63152,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.4.24,PORTIA,"Lorenzo, I commit into your hands"

63222,63223,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.5.3,LAUNCELOT,"promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with"
63223,63224,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.5.4,LAUNCELOT,"you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:"
63224,63225,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.5.5,LAUNCELOT,"therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you"
63225,63226,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.5.6,LAUNCELOT,are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
63226,63227,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.5.7,LAUNCELOT,"you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard"
63227,63228,Merchant of Venice,1.0,3.5.8,LAUNCELOT,hope neither.
63228,63229,Merchant of Venice,2.0,3.5.9,JESSICA,"And what hope is that, I pray thee?"
63229,63230,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.5.10,LAUNCELOT,"Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you"
63230,63231,Merchant of Venice,3.0,3.5.11,LAUNCELOT,"not, that you are not the Jew's daughter."
63231,63232,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.5.12,JESSICA,"That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the"
63232,63233,Merchant of Venice,4.0,3.5.13,JESSICA,sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
63233,63234,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.5.14,LAUNCELOT,Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
63234,63235,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.5.15,LAUNCELOT,"mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I"
63235,63236,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.5.16,LAUNCELOT,"fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are"
63236,63237,Merchant of Venice,5.0,3.5.17,LAUNCELOT,gone both ways.

63239,63240,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.5.20,LAUNCELOT,"Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians"

63241,63242,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.5.22,LAUNCELOT,another. This making Christians will raise the

63243,63244,Merchant of Venice,7.0,3.5.24,LAUNCELOT,shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
63244,63245,Merchant of Venice,7.0,,LAUNCELOT,Enter LORENZO
63245,63246,Merchant of Venice,8.0,3.5.25,JESSICA,"I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes."

63249,63250,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.5.29,JESSICA,"are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for"
63250,63251,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.5.30,JESSICA,"me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he"
63251,63252,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.5.31,JESSICA,"says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,"
63252,63253,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.5.32,JESSICA,"for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the"
63253,63254,Merchant of Venice,10.0,3.5.33,JESSICA,price of pork.
63254,63255,Merchant of Venice,11.0,3.5.34,LORENZO,I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than

63257,63258,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.5.37,LAUNCELOT,It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
63258,63259,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.5.38,LAUNCELOT,"but if she be less than an honest woman, she is"
63259,63260,Merchant of Venice,12.0,3.5.39,LAUNCELOT,indeed more than I took her for.
63260,63261,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.5.40,LORENZO,How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
63261,63262,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.5.41,LORENZO,"best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,"
63262,63263,Merchant of Venice,13.0,3.5.42,LORENZO,and discourse grow commendable in none only but

63269,63270,Merchant of Venice,18.0,3.5.49,LAUNCELOT,"Not so, sir, neither, I know my duty."
63270,63271,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.5.50,LORENZO,Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
63271,63272,Merchant of Venice,19.0,3.5.51,LORENZO,the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray

63369,63370,Merchant of Venice,8.0,4.1.57,SHYLOCK,"Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force"
63370,63371,Merchant of Venice,8.0,4.1.58,SHYLOCK,Must yield to such inevitable shame
63371,63372,Merchant of Venice,8.0,4.1.59,SHYLOCK,"As to offend, himself being offended,"

63375,63376,Merchant of Venice,8.0,4.1.63,SHYLOCK,A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

63381,63382,Merchant of Venice,13.0,4.1.69,BASSANIO,Every offence is not a hate at first.
63382,63383,Merchant of Venice,14.0,4.1.70,SHYLOCK,"What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?"

63388,63389,Merchant of Venice,15.0,4.1.76,ANTONIO,You may as well forbid the mountain pines

63520,63521,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.205,PORTIA,"Though justice be thy plea, consider this,"
63521,63522,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.206,PORTIA,"That, in the course of justice, none of us"
63522,63523,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.207,PORTIA,"Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy,"
63523,63524,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.208,PORTIA,And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
63524,63525,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.209,PORTIA,The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
63525,63526,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.210,PORTIA,"To mitigate the justice of thy plea,"
63526,63527,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.211,PORTIA,"Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice"
63527,63528,Merchant of Venice,50.0,4.1.212,PORTIA,Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
63528,63529,Merchant of Venice,51.0,4.1.213,SHYLOCK,"My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,"
63529,63530,Merchant of Venice,51.0,4.1.214,SHYLOCK,The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
63530,63531,Merchant of Venice,52.0,4.1.215,PORTIA,Is he not able to discharge the money?
63531,63532,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.216,BASSANIO,"Yes, here I tender it for him in the court,"
63532,63533,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.217,BASSANIO,"Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,"
63533,63534,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.218,BASSANIO,"I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,"
63534,63535,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.219,BASSANIO,"On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:"
63535,63536,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.220,BASSANIO,"If this will not suffice, it must appear"
63536,63537,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.221,BASSANIO,"That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,"
63537,63538,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.222,BASSANIO,Wrest once the law to your authority:
63538,63539,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.223,BASSANIO,"To do a great right, do a little wrong,"
63539,63540,Merchant of Venice,53.0,4.1.224,BASSANIO,And curb this cruel devil of his will.
63540,63541,Merchant of Venice,54.0,4.1.225,PORTIA,"It must not be, there is no power in Venice"
63541,63542,Merchant of Venice,54.0,4.1.226,PORTIA,Can alter a decree established:
63542,63543,Merchant of Venice,54.0,4.1.227,PORTIA,"'Twill be recorded for a precedent,"
63543,63544,Merchant of Venice,54.0,4.1.228,PORTIA,And many an error by the same example
63544,63545,Merchant of Venice,54.0,4.1.229,PORTIA,Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
63545,63546,Merchant of Venice,55.0,4.1.230,SHYLOCK,"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!"
63546,63547,Merchant of Venice,55.0,4.1.231,SHYLOCK,"O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!"
63547,63548,Merchant of Venice,56.0,4.1.232,PORTIA,"I pray you, let me look upon the bond."
63548,63549,Merchant of Venice,57.0,4.1.233,SHYLOCK,"Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is."
63549,63550,Merchant of Venice,58.0,4.1.234,PORTIA,"Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee."
63550,63551,Merchant of Venice,59.0,4.1.235,SHYLOCK,"An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:"
63551,63552,Merchant of Venice,59.0,4.1.236,SHYLOCK,Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
63552,63553,Merchant of Venice,59.0,4.1.237,SHYLOCK,"No, not for Venice."
63553,63554,Merchant of Venice,60.0,4.1.238,PORTIA,"Why, this bond is forfeit,"
63554,63555,Merchant of Venice,60.0,4.1.239,PORTIA,And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
63555,63556,Merchant of Venice,60.0,4.1.240,PORTIA,"A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off"
63556,63557,Merchant of Venice,60.0,4.1.241,PORTIA,Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
63557,63558,Merchant of Venice,60.0,4.1.242,PORTIA,"Take thrice thy money, bid me tear the bond."
63558,63559,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.243,SHYLOCK,When it is paid according to the tenor.
63559,63560,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.244,SHYLOCK,"It doth appear you are a worthy judge,"
63560,63561,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.245,SHYLOCK,"You know the law, your exposition"
63561,63562,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.246,SHYLOCK,"Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,"
63562,63563,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.247,SHYLOCK,"Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,"
63563,63564,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.248,SHYLOCK,Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
63564,63565,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.249,SHYLOCK,There is no power in the tongue of man
63565,63566,Merchant of Venice,61.0,4.1.250,SHYLOCK,To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
63566,63567,Merchant of Venice,62.0,4.1.251,ANTONIO,Most heartily I do beseech the court
63567,63568,Merchant of Venice,62.0,4.1.252,ANTONIO,To give the judgment.
63568,63569,Merchant of Venice,63.0,4.1.253,PORTIA,"Why then, thus it is:"
63569,63570,Merchant of Venice,63.0,4.1.254,PORTIA,You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
63570,63571,Merchant of Venice,64.0,4.1.255,SHYLOCK,O noble judge! O excellent young man!
63571,63572,Merchant of Venice,65.0,4.1.256,PORTIA,For the intent and purpose of the law
63572,63573,Merchant of Venice,65.0,4.1.257,PORTIA,"Hath full relation to the penalty,"
63573,63574,Merchant of Venice,65.0,4.1.258,PORTIA,Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
63574,63575,Merchant of Venice,66.0,4.1.259,SHYLOCK,'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
63575,63576,Merchant of Venice,66.0,4.1.260,SHYLOCK,How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
63576,63577,Merchant of Venice,67.0,4.1.261,PORTIA,Therefore lay bare your bosom.
63577,63578,Merchant of Venice,68.0,4.1.262,SHYLOCK,"Ay, his breast:"
63578,63579,Merchant of Venice,68.0,4.1.263,SHYLOCK,"So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?"
63579,63580,Merchant of Venice,68.0,4.1.264,SHYLOCK,'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
63580,63581,Merchant of Venice,69.0,4.1.265,PORTIA,It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
63581,63582,Merchant of Venice,69.0,4.1.266,PORTIA,The flesh?
63582,63583,Merchant of Venice,70.0,4.1.267,SHYLOCK,I have them ready.
63583,63584,Merchant of Venice,71.0,4.1.268,PORTIA,"Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,"
63584,63585,Merchant of Venice,71.0,4.1.269,PORTIA,"To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death."
63585,63586,Merchant of Venice,72.0,4.1.270,SHYLOCK,Is it so nominated in the bond?
63586,63587,Merchant of Venice,73.0,4.1.271,PORTIA,It is not so express'd: but what of that?
63587,63588,Merchant of Venice,73.0,4.1.272,PORTIA,'Twere good you do so much for charity.
63588,63589,Merchant of Venice,74.0,4.1.273,SHYLOCK,"I cannot find it, 'tis not in the bond."
63589,63590,Merchant of Venice,75.0,4.1.274,PORTIA,"You, merchant, have you any thing to say?"
63590,63591,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.275,ANTONIO,But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
63591,63592,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.276,ANTONIO,"Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!"
63592,63593,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.277,ANTONIO,"Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you,"
63593,63594,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.278,ANTONIO,For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
63594,63595,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.279,ANTONIO,Than is her custom: it is still her use
63595,63596,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.280,ANTONIO,"To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,"
63596,63597,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.281,ANTONIO,To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
63597,63598,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.282,ANTONIO,"An age of poverty, from which lingering penance"
63598,63599,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.283,ANTONIO,Of such misery doth she cut me off.
63599,63600,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.284,ANTONIO,Commend me to your honourable wife:
63600,63601,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.285,ANTONIO,"Tell her the process of Antonio's end,"
63601,63602,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.286,ANTONIO,"Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death,"
63602,63603,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.287,ANTONIO,"And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge"
63603,63604,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.288,ANTONIO,Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
63604,63605,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.289,ANTONIO,"Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,"
63605,63606,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.290,ANTONIO,"And he repents not that he pays your debt,"
63606,63607,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.291,ANTONIO,"For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,"
63607,63608,Merchant of Venice,76.0,4.1.292,ANTONIO,I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
63608,63609,Merchant of Venice,77.0,4.1.293,BASSANIO,"Antonio, I am married to a wife"
63609,63610,Merchant of Venice,77.0,4.1.294,BASSANIO,"Which is as dear to me as life itself,"
63610,63611,Merchant of Venice,77.0,4.1.295,BASSANIO,"But life itself, my wife, and all the world,"
63611,63612,Merchant of Venice,77.0,4.1.296,BASSANIO,Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
63612,63613,Merchant of Venice,77.0,4.1.297,BASSANIO,"I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all"
63613,63614,Merchant of Venice,77.0,4.1.298,BASSANIO,"Here to this devil, to deliver you."
63614,63615,Merchant of Venice,78.0,4.1.299,PORTIA,"Your wife would give you little thanks for that,"
63615,63616,Merchant of Venice,78.0,4.1.300,PORTIA,"If she were by, to hear you make the offer."
63616,63617,Merchant of Venice,79.0,4.1.301,GRATIANO,"I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:"
63617,63618,Merchant of Venice,79.0,4.1.302,GRATIANO,"I would she were in heaven, so she could"
63618,63619,Merchant of Venice,79.0,4.1.303,GRATIANO,Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
63619,63620,Merchant of Venice,80.0,4.1.304,NERISSA,"'Tis well you offer it behind her back,"
63620,63621,Merchant of Venice,80.0,4.1.305,NERISSA,The wish would make else an unquiet house.
63621,63622,Merchant of Venice,81.0,4.1.306,SHYLOCK,"These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter,"
63622,63623,Merchant of Venice,81.0,4.1.307,SHYLOCK,Would any of the stock of Barrabas
63623,63624,Merchant of Venice,81.0,4.1.308,SHYLOCK,Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
63624,63625,Merchant of Venice,81.0,,SHYLOCK,Aside
63625,63626,Merchant of Venice,81.0,4.1.309,SHYLOCK,"We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence."
63626,63627,Merchant of Venice,82.0,4.1.310,PORTIA,A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
63627,63628,Merchant of Venice,82.0,4.1.311,PORTIA,"The court awards it, and the law doth give it."
63628,63629,Merchant of Venice,83.0,4.1.312,SHYLOCK,Most rightful judge!
63629,63630,Merchant of Venice,84.0,4.1.313,PORTIA,And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
63630,63631,Merchant of Venice,84.0,4.1.314,PORTIA,"The law allows it, and the court awards it."
63631,63632,Merchant of Venice,85.0,4.1.315,SHYLOCK,"Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!"
63632,63633,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.316,PORTIA,"Tarry a little, there is something else."
63633,63634,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.317,PORTIA,"This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood,"
63634,63635,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.318,PORTIA,The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
63635,63636,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.319,PORTIA,"Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,"
63636,63637,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.320,PORTIA,"But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed"
63637,63638,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.321,PORTIA,"One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods"
63638,63639,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.322,PORTIA,"Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate"
63639,63640,Merchant of Venice,86.0,4.1.323,PORTIA,Unto the state of Venice.
63640,63641,Merchant of Venice,87.0,4.1.324,GRATIANO,"O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!"
63641,63642,Merchant of Venice,88.0,4.1.325,SHYLOCK,Is that the law?
63642,63643,Merchant of Venice,89.0,4.1.326,PORTIA,Thyself shalt see the act:
63643,63644,Merchant of Venice,89.0,4.1.327,PORTIA,"For, as thou urgest justice, be assured"
63644,63645,Merchant of Venice,89.0,4.1.328,PORTIA,"Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest."
63645,63646,Merchant of Venice,90.0,4.1.329,GRATIANO,"O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!"
63646,63647,Merchant of Venice,91.0,4.1.330,SHYLOCK,"I take this offer, then, pay the bond thrice"
63647,63648,Merchant of Venice,91.0,4.1.331,SHYLOCK,And let the Christian go.
63648,63649,Merchant of Venice,92.0,4.1.332,BASSANIO,Here is the money.
63649,63650,Merchant of Venice,93.0,4.1.333,PORTIA,Soft!
63650,63651,Merchant of Venice,93.0,4.1.334,PORTIA,"The Jew shall have all justice, soft! no haste:"
63651,63652,Merchant of Venice,93.0,4.1.335,PORTIA,He shall have nothing but the penalty.
63652,63653,Merchant of Venice,94.0,4.1.336,GRATIANO,"O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!"
63653,63654,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.337,PORTIA,Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
63654,63655,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.338,PORTIA,"Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more"
63655,63656,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.339,PORTIA,But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
63656,63657,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.340,PORTIA,"Or less than a just pound, be it but so much"
63657,63658,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.341,PORTIA,"As makes it light or heavy in the substance,"
63658,63659,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.342,PORTIA,Or the division of the twentieth part
63659,63660,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.343,PORTIA,"Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn"
63660,63661,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.344,PORTIA,"But in the estimation of a hair,"
63661,63662,Merchant of Venice,95.0,4.1.345,PORTIA,Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
63662,63663,Merchant of Venice,96.0,4.1.346,GRATIANO,"A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!"
63663,63664,Merchant of Venice,96.0,4.1.347,GRATIANO,"Now, infidel, I have you on the hip."
63664,63665,Merchant of Venice,97.0,4.1.348,PORTIA,Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
63665,63666,Merchant of Venice,98.0,4.1.349,SHYLOCK,"Give me my principal, and let me go."
63666,63667,Merchant of Venice,99.0,4.1.350,BASSANIO,"I have it ready for thee, here it is."
63667,63668,Merchant of Venice,100.0,4.1.351,PORTIA,He hath refused it in the open court:
63668,63669,Merchant of Venice,100.0,4.1.352,PORTIA,He shall have merely justice and his bond.
63669,63670,Merchant of Venice,101.0,4.1.353,GRATIANO,"A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!"
63670,63671,Merchant of Venice,101.0,4.1.354,GRATIANO,"I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word."
63671,63672,Merchant of Venice,102.0,4.1.355,SHYLOCK,Shall I not have barely my principal?
63672,63673,Merchant of Venice,103.0,4.1.356,PORTIA,"Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,"
63673,63674,Merchant of Venice,103.0,4.1.357,PORTIA,"To be so taken at thy peril, Jew."
63674,63675,Merchant of Venice,104.0,4.1.358,SHYLOCK,"Why, then the devil give him good of it!"
63675,63676,Merchant of Venice,104.0,4.1.359,SHYLOCK,I'll stay no longer question.
63676,63677,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.360,PORTIA,"Tarry, Jew:"
63677,63678,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.361,PORTIA,The law hath yet another hold on you.
63678,63679,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.362,PORTIA,"It is enacted in the laws of Venice,"
63679,63680,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.363,PORTIA,If it be proved against an alien
63680,63681,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.364,PORTIA,That by direct or indirect attempts
63681,63682,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.365,PORTIA,"He seek the life of any citizen,"
63682,63683,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.366,PORTIA,The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
63683,63684,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.367,PORTIA,"Shall seize one half his goods, the other half"
63684,63685,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.368,PORTIA,"Comes to the privy coffer of the state,"
63685,63686,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.369,PORTIA,And the offender's life lies in the mercy
63686,63687,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.370,PORTIA,"Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice."
63687,63688,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.371,PORTIA,"In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st,"
63688,63689,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.372,PORTIA,"For it appears, by manifest proceeding,"
63689,63690,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.373,PORTIA,That indirectly and directly too
63690,63691,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.374,PORTIA,Thou hast contrived against the very life
63691,63692,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.375,PORTIA,"Of the defendant, and thou hast incurr'd"
63692,63693,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.376,PORTIA,The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
63693,63694,Merchant of Venice,105.0,4.1.377,PORTIA,Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.

63756,63757,Merchant of Venice,126.0,4.1.438,BASSANIO,"Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,"
63757,63758,Merchant of Venice,126.0,4.1.439,BASSANIO,"Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,"

63769,63770,Merchant of Venice,129.0,4.1.449,PORTIA,And now methinks I have a mind to it.
63770,63771,Merchant of Venice,130.0,4.1.450,BASSANIO,There's more depends on this than on the value.
63771,63772,Merchant of Venice,130.0,4.1.451,BASSANIO,"The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,"

63777,63778,Merchant of Venice,132.0,4.1.457,BASSANIO,"Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife,"
63778,63779,Merchant of Venice,132.0,4.1.458,BASSANIO,"And when she put it on, she made me vow"
63779,63780,Merchant of Venice,132.0,4.1.459,BASSANIO,That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
63780,63781,Merchant of Venice,133.0,4.1.460,PORTIA,That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
63781,63782,Merchant of Venice,133.0,4.1.461,PORTIA,"An if your wife be not a mad-woman,"
63782,63783,Merchant of Venice,133.0,4.1.462,PORTIA,"And know how well I have deserved the ring,"

63893,63894,Merchant of Venice,23.0,5.1.62,LORENZO,Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
63894,63895,Merchant of Venice,23.0,5.1.63,LORENZO,Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night

63934,63935,Merchant of Venice,28.0,5.1.100,PORTIA,So doth the greater glory dim the less:

63973,63974,Merchant of Venice,40.0,5.1.137,PORTIA,Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
63974,63975,Merchant of Venice,40.0,,PORTIA,"Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers"
63975,63976,Merchant of Venice,41.0,5.1.138,BASSANIO,"We should hold day with the Antipodes,"
63976,63977,Merchant of Venice,41.0,5.1.139,BASSANIO,If you would walk in absence of the sun.
63977,63978,Merchant of Venice,42.0,5.1.140,PORTIA,"Let me give light, but let me not be light,"
63978,63979,Merchant of Venice,42.0,5.1.141,PORTIA,"For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,"
63979,63980,Merchant of Venice,42.0,5.1.142,PORTIA,And never be Bassanio so for me:
63980,63981,Merchant of Venice,42.0,5.1.143,PORTIA,"But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord."
63981,63982,Merchant of Venice,43.0,5.1.144,BASSANIO,"I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend."
63982,63983,Merchant of Venice,43.0,5.1.145,BASSANIO,"This is the man, this is Antonio,"
63983,63984,Merchant of Venice,43.0,5.1.146,BASSANIO,To whom I am so infinitely bound.
63984,63985,Merchant of Venice,44.0,5.1.147,PORTIA,You should in all sense be much bound to him.
63985,63986,Merchant of Venice,44.0,5.1.148,PORTIA,"For, as I hear, he was much bound for you."
63986,63987,Merchant of Venice,45.0,5.1.149,ANTONIO,No more than I am well acquitted of.
63987,63988,Merchant of Venice,46.0,5.1.150,PORTIA,"Sir, you are very welcome to our house:"
63988,63989,Merchant of Venice,46.0,5.1.151,PORTIA,"It must appear in other ways than words,"
63989,63990,Merchant of Venice,46.0,5.1.152,PORTIA,Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
63990,63991,Merchant of Venice,47.0,5.1.153,GRATIANO,"[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong,"
63991,63992,Merchant of Venice,47.0,5.1.154,GRATIANO,"In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:"
63992,63993,Merchant of Venice,47.0,5.1.155,GRATIANO,"Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,"
63993,63994,Merchant of Venice,47.0,5.1.156,GRATIANO,"Since you do take it, love, so much at heart."
63994,63995,Merchant of Venice,48.0,5.1.157,PORTIA,"A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?"
63995,63996,Merchant of Venice,49.0,5.1.158,GRATIANO,"About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring"
63996,63997,Merchant of Venice,49.0,5.1.159,GRATIANO,"That she did give me, whose posy was"
63997,63998,Merchant of Venice,49.0,5.1.160,GRATIANO,For all the world like cutler's poetry
63998,63999,Merchant of Venice,49.0,5.1.161,GRATIANO,"Upon  a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'"
63999,64000,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.162,NERISSA,What talk you of the posy or the value?
64000,64001,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.163,NERISSA,"You swore to me, when I did give it you,"
64001,64002,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.164,NERISSA,That you would wear it till your hour of death
64002,64003,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.165,NERISSA,And that it should lie with you in your grave:
64003,64004,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.166,NERISSA,"Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,"
64004,64005,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.167,NERISSA,You should have been respective and have kept it.
64005,64006,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.168,NERISSA,"Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,"
64006,64007,Merchant of Venice,50.0,5.1.169,NERISSA,The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
64007,64008,Merchant of Venice,51.0,5.1.170,GRATIANO,"He will, an if he live to be a man."
64008,64009,Merchant of Venice,52.0,5.1.171,NERISSA,"Ay, if a woman live to be a man."
64009,64010,Merchant of Venice,53.0,5.1.172,GRATIANO,"Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,"
64010,64011,Merchant of Venice,53.0,5.1.173,GRATIANO,"A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,"
64011,64012,Merchant of Venice,53.0,5.1.174,GRATIANO,"No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk,"
64012,64013,Merchant of Venice,53.0,5.1.175,GRATIANO,"A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:"
64013,64014,Merchant of Venice,53.0,5.1.176,GRATIANO,I could not for my heart deny it him.
64014,64015,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.177,PORTIA,"You were to blame, I must be plain with you,"
64015,64016,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.178,PORTIA,To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
64016,64017,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.179,PORTIA,A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
64017,64018,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.180,PORTIA,And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
64018,64019,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.181,PORTIA,I gave my love a ring and made him swear
64019,64020,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.182,PORTIA,"Never to part with it, and here he stands,"
64020,64021,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.183,PORTIA,I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
64021,64022,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.184,PORTIA,"Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth"
64022,64023,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.185,PORTIA,"That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,"
64023,64024,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.186,PORTIA,You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
64024,64025,Merchant of Venice,54.0,5.1.187,PORTIA,"An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it."
64025,64026,Merchant of Venice,55.0,5.1.188,BASSANIO,"[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off"
64026,64027,Merchant of Venice,55.0,5.1.189,BASSANIO,And swear I lost the ring defending it.
64027,64028,Merchant of Venice,56.0,5.1.190,GRATIANO,My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
64028,64029,Merchant of Venice,56.0,5.1.191,GRATIANO,Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
64029,64030,Merchant of Venice,56.0,5.1.192,GRATIANO,"Deserved it too, and then the boy, his clerk,"
64030,64031,Merchant of Venice,56.0,5.1.193,GRATIANO,"That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine,"
64031,64032,Merchant of Venice,56.0,5.1.194,GRATIANO,And neither man nor master would take aught
64032,64033,Merchant of Venice,56.0,5.1.195,GRATIANO,But the two rings.
64033,64034,Merchant of Venice,57.0,5.1.196,PORTIA,What ring gave you my lord?
64034,64035,Merchant of Venice,57.0,5.1.197,PORTIA,"Not that, I hope, which you received of me."
64035,64036,Merchant of Venice,58.0,5.1.198,BASSANIO,"If I could add a lie unto a fault,"
64036,64037,Merchant of Venice,58.0,5.1.199,BASSANIO,"I would deny it, but you see my finger"
64037,64038,Merchant of Venice,58.0,5.1.200,BASSANIO,"Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone."
64038,64039,Merchant of Venice,59.0,5.1.201,PORTIA,Even so void is your false heart of truth.
64039,64040,Merchant of Venice,59.0,5.1.202,PORTIA,"By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed"
64040,64041,Merchant of Venice,59.0,5.1.203,PORTIA,Until I see the ring.
64041,64042,Merchant of Venice,60.0,5.1.204,NERISSA,Nor I in yours
64042,64043,Merchant of Venice,60.0,5.1.205,NERISSA,Till I again see mine.
64043,64044,Merchant of Venice,61.0,5.1.206,BASSANIO,"Sweet Portia,"
64044,64045,Merchant of Venice,61.0,5.1.207,BASSANIO,"If you did know to whom I gave the ring,"
64045,64046,Merchant of Venice,61.0,5.1.208,BASSANIO,If you did know for whom I gave the ring
64046,64047,Merchant of Venice,61.0,5.1.209,BASSANIO,And would conceive for what I gave the ring
64047,64048,Merchant of Venice,61.0,5.1.210,BASSANIO,"And how unwillingly I left the ring,"
64048,64049,Merchant of Venice,61.0,5.1.211,BASSANIO,"When nought would be accepted but the ring,"
64049,64050,Merchant of Venice,61.0,5.1.212,BASSANIO,You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
64050,64051,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.213,PORTIA,"If you had known the virtue of the ring,"
64051,64052,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.214,PORTIA,"Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,"
64052,64053,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.215,PORTIA,"Or your own honour to contain the ring,"
64053,64054,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.216,PORTIA,You would not then have parted with the ring.
64054,64055,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.217,PORTIA,"What man is there so much unreasonable,"
64055,64056,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.218,PORTIA,If you had pleased to have defended it
64056,64057,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.219,PORTIA,"With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty"
64057,64058,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.220,PORTIA,To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
64058,64059,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.221,PORTIA,Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
64059,64060,Merchant of Venice,62.0,5.1.222,PORTIA,I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
64060,64061,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.223,BASSANIO,"No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,"
64061,64062,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.224,BASSANIO,"No woman had it, but a civil doctor,"
64062,64063,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.225,BASSANIO,Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
64063,64064,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.226,BASSANIO,"And begg'd the ring, the which I did deny him"
64064,64065,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.227,BASSANIO,"And suffer'd him to go displeased away,"
64065,64066,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.228,BASSANIO,Even he that did uphold the very life
64066,64067,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.229,BASSANIO,"Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?"
64067,64068,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.230,BASSANIO,"I was enforced to send it after him,"
64068,64069,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.231,BASSANIO,"I was beset with shame and courtesy,"
64069,64070,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.232,BASSANIO,My honour would not let ingratitude
64070,64071,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.233,BASSANIO,"So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,"
64071,64072,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.234,BASSANIO,"For, by these blessed candles of the night,"
64072,64073,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.235,BASSANIO,"Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd"
64073,64074,Merchant of Venice,63.0,5.1.236,BASSANIO,The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
64074,64075,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.237,PORTIA,Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
64075,64076,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.238,PORTIA,"Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,"
64076,64077,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.239,PORTIA,"And that which you did swear to keep for me,"
64077,64078,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.240,PORTIA,"I will become as liberal as you,"
64078,64079,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.241,PORTIA,"I'll not deny him any thing I have,"
64079,64080,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.242,PORTIA,"No, not my body nor my husband's bed:"
64080,64081,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.243,PORTIA,"Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:"
64081,64082,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.244,PORTIA,"Lie not a night from home, watch me like Argus:"
64082,64083,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.245,PORTIA,"If you do not, if I be left alone,"
64083,64084,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.246,PORTIA,"Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,"
64084,64085,Merchant of Venice,64.0,5.1.247,PORTIA,I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
64085,64086,Merchant of Venice,65.0,5.1.248,NERISSA,"And I his clerk, therefore be well advised"
64086,64087,Merchant of Venice,65.0,5.1.249,NERISSA,How you do leave me to mine own protection.
64087,64088,Merchant of Venice,66.0,5.1.250,GRATIANO,"Well, do you so, let not me take him, then,"
64088,64089,Merchant of Venice,66.0,5.1.251,GRATIANO,"For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen."
64089,64090,Merchant of Venice,67.0,5.1.252,ANTONIO,I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
64090,64091,Merchant of Venice,68.0,5.1.253,PORTIA,"Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding."
64091,64092,Merchant of Venice,69.0,5.1.254,BASSANIO,"Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,"
64092,64093,Merchant of Venice,69.0,5.1.255,BASSANIO,"And, in the hearing of these many friends,"
64093,64094,Merchant of Venice,69.0,5.1.256,BASSANIO,"I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,"
64094,64095,Merchant of Venice,69.0,5.1.257,BASSANIO,Wherein I see myself--
64095,64096,Merchant of Venice,70.0,5.1.258,PORTIA,Mark you but that!
64096,64097,Merchant of Venice,70.0,5.1.259,PORTIA,"In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,"
64097,64098,Merchant of Venice,70.0,5.1.260,PORTIA,"In each eye, one: swear by your double self,"
64098,64099,Merchant of Venice,70.0,5.1.261,PORTIA,And there's an oath of credit.
64099,64100,Merchant of Venice,71.0,5.1.262,BASSANIO,"Nay, but hear me:"
64100,64101,Merchant of Venice,71.0,5.1.263,BASSANIO,"Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear"
64101,64102,Merchant of Venice,71.0,5.1.264,BASSANIO,I never more will break an oath with thee.
64102,64103,Merchant of Venice,72.0,5.1.265,ANTONIO,"I once did lend my body for his wealth,"
64103,64104,Merchant of Venice,72.0,5.1.266,ANTONIO,"Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,"
64104,64105,Merchant of Venice,72.0,5.1.267,ANTONIO,"Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,"
64105,64106,Merchant of Venice,72.0,5.1.268,ANTONIO,"My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord"
64106,64107,Merchant of Venice,72.0,5.1.269,ANTONIO,Will never more break faith advisedly.
64107,64108,Merchant of Venice,73.0,5.1.270,PORTIA,Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
64108,64109,Merchant of Venice,73.0,5.1.271,PORTIA,And bid him keep it better than the other.
64109,64110,Merchant of Venice,74.0,5.1.272,ANTONIO,"Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring."
64110,64111,Merchant of Venice,75.0,5.1.273,BASSANIO,"By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!"
64111,64112,Merchant of Venice,76.0,5.1.274,PORTIA,"I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,"
64112,64113,Merchant of Venice,76.0,5.1.275,PORTIA,"For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me."
64113,64114,Merchant of Venice,77.0,5.1.276,NERISSA,"And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,"
64114,64115,Merchant of Venice,77.0,5.1.277,NERISSA,"For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,"
64115,64116,Merchant of Venice,77.0,5.1.278,NERISSA,In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
64116,64117,Merchant of Venice,78.0,5.1.279,GRATIANO,"Why, this is like the mending of highways"
64117,64118,Merchant of Venice,78.0,5.1.280,GRATIANO,"In summer, where the ways are fair enough:"
64118,64119,Merchant of Venice,78.0,5.1.281,GRATIANO,"What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?"
64119,64120,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.282,PORTIA,Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
64120,64121,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.283,PORTIA,"Here is a letter, read it at your leisure,"
64121,64122,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.284,PORTIA,"It comes from Padua, from Bellario:"
64122,64123,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.285,PORTIA,"There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,"
64123,64124,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.286,PORTIA,Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
64124,64125,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.287,PORTIA,Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
64125,64126,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.288,PORTIA,"And even but now return'd, I have not yet"
64126,64127,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.289,PORTIA,"Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome,"
64127,64128,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.290,PORTIA,And I have better news in store for you
64128,64129,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.291,PORTIA,"Than you expect: unseal this letter soon,"
64129,64130,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.292,PORTIA,There you shall find three of your argosies
64130,64131,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.293,PORTIA,Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
64131,64132,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.294,PORTIA,You shall not know by what strange accident
64132,64133,Merchant of Venice,79.0,5.1.295,PORTIA,I chanced on this letter.
64133,64134,Merchant of Venice,80.0,5.1.296,ANTONIO,I am dumb.
64134,64135,Merchant of Venice,81.0,5.1.297,BASSANIO,Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
64135,64136,Merchant of Venice,82.0,5.1.298,GRATIANO,Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
64136,64137,Merchant of Venice,83.0,5.1.299,NERISSA,"Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,"
64137,64138,Merchant of Venice,83.0,5.1.300,NERISSA,Unless he live until he be a man.
64138,64139,Merchant of Venice,84.0,5.1.301,BASSANIO,"Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:"
64139,64140,Merchant of Venice,84.0,5.1.302,BASSANIO,"When I am absent, then lie with my wife."
64140,64141,Merchant of Venice,85.0,5.1.303,ANTONIO,"Sweet lady, you have given me life and living,"
64141,64142,Merchant of Venice,85.0,5.1.304,ANTONIO,For here I read for certain that my ships
64142,64143,Merchant of Venice,85.0,5.1.305,ANTONIO,Are safely come to road.
64143,64144,Merchant of Venice,86.0,5.1.306,PORTIA,"How now, Lorenzo!"
64144,64145,Merchant of Venice,86.0,5.1.307,PORTIA,My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
64145,64146,Merchant of Venice,87.0,5.1.308,NERISSA,"Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee."
64146,64147,Merchant of Venice,87.0,5.1.309,NERISSA,"There do I give to you and Jessica,"
64147,64148,Merchant of Venice,87.0,5.1.310,NERISSA,"From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,"
64148,64149,Merchant of Venice,87.0,5.1.311,NERISSA,"After his death, of all he dies possess'd of."
64149,64150,Merchant of Venice,88.0,5.1.312,LORENZO,"Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way"
64150,64151,Merchant of Venice,88.0,5.1.313,LORENZO,Of starved people.
64151,64152,Merchant of Venice,89.0,5.1.314,PORTIA,"It is almost morning,"
64152,64153,Merchant of Venice,89.0,5.1.315,PORTIA,And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
64153,64154,Merchant of Venice,89.0,5.1.316,PORTIA,"Of these events at full. Let us go in,"
64154,64155,Merchant of Venice,89.0,5.1.317,PORTIA,"And charge us there upon inter'gatories,"
64155,64156,Merchant of Venice,89.0,5.1.318,PORTIA,And we will answer all things faithfully.
64156,64157,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.319,GRATIANO,Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
64157,64158,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.320,GRATIANO,"That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,"
64158,64159,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.321,GRATIANO,"Whether till the next night she had rather stay,"
64159,64160,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.322,GRATIANO,"Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:"
64160,64161,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.323,GRATIANO,"But were the day come, I should wish it dark,"
64161,64162,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.324,GRATIANO,That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
64162,64163,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.325,GRATIANO,"Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing"
64163,64164,Merchant of Venice,90.0,5.1.326,GRATIANO,So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
64164,64165,Merchant of Venice,90.0,,GRATIANO,Exeunt

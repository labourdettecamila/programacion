3208,3209,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.1.1,BEDFORD,"Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!"
3209,3210,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.1.2,BEDFORD,"Comets, importing change of times and states,"
3210,3211,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.1.3,BEDFORD,"Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,"
3211,3212,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.1.4,BEDFORD,And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
3212,3213,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.1.5,BEDFORD,That have consented unto Henry's death!
3213,3214,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.1.6,BEDFORD,"King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!"
3214,3215,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.1.7,BEDFORD,England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
3215,3216,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.8,GLOUCESTER,England ne'er had a king until his time.
3216,3217,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.9,GLOUCESTER,"Virtue he had, deserving to command:"
3217,3218,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.10,GLOUCESTER,His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
3218,3219,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.11,GLOUCESTER,"His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings,"
3219,3220,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.12,GLOUCESTER,"His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,"
3220,3221,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.13,GLOUCESTER,More dazzled and drove back his enemies
3221,3222,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.14,GLOUCESTER,Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
3222,3223,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.15,GLOUCESTER,What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
3223,3224,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.1.16,GLOUCESTER,He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
3224,3225,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.17,EXETER,We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
3225,3226,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.18,EXETER,Henry is dead and never shall revive:
3226,3227,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.19,EXETER,"Upon a wooden coffin we attend,"
3227,3228,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.20,EXETER,And death's dishonourable victory
3228,3229,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.21,EXETER,"We with our stately presence glorify,"
3229,3230,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.22,EXETER,Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
3230,3231,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.23,EXETER,What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
3231,3232,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.24,EXETER,That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
3232,3233,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.25,EXETER,Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
3233,3234,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.26,EXETER,"Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him"
3234,3235,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.27,EXETER,By magic verses have contrived his end?
3235,3236,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.1.28,EXETER,BISHOP
3236,3237,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.1.29,OF WINCHESTER,He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
3237,3238,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.1.30,OF WINCHESTER,Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day
3238,3239,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.1.31,OF WINCHESTER,So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
3239,3240,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.1.32,OF WINCHESTER,The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
3240,3241,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.1.33,OF WINCHESTER,The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
3241,3242,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.1.34,GLOUCESTER,"The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,"
3242,3243,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.1.35,GLOUCESTER,His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
3243,3244,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.1.36,GLOUCESTER,"None do you like but an effeminate prince,"
3244,3245,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.1.37,GLOUCESTER,"Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe."
3245,3246,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.1.38,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
3246,3247,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.1.39,OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector"
3247,3248,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.1.40,OF WINCHESTER,And lookest to command the prince and realm.
3248,3249,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.1.41,OF WINCHESTER,"Thy wife is proud, she holdeth thee in awe,"
3249,3250,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.1.42,OF WINCHESTER,More than God or religious churchmen may.
3250,3251,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.1.43,GLOUCESTER,"Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,"
3251,3252,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.1.44,GLOUCESTER,And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
3252,3253,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.1.45,GLOUCESTER,Except it be to pray against thy foes.
3253,3254,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.46,BEDFORD,"Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:"
3254,3255,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.47,BEDFORD,"Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:"
3255,3256,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.48,BEDFORD,"Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:"
3256,3257,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.49,BEDFORD,Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
3257,3258,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.50,BEDFORD,"Posterity, await for wretched years,"
3258,3259,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.51,BEDFORD,"When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,"
3259,3260,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.52,BEDFORD,"Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,"
3260,3261,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.53,BEDFORD,And none but women left to wail the dead.
3261,3262,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.54,BEDFORD,"Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:"
3262,3263,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.55,BEDFORD,"Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,"
3263,3264,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.56,BEDFORD,Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
3264,3265,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.57,BEDFORD,A far more glorious star thy soul will make
3265,3266,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.1.58,BEDFORD,Than Julius Caesar or bright--
3266,3267,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,,BEDFORD,Enter a Messenger
3267,3268,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.1.59,Messenger,"My honourable lords, health to you all!"
3268,3269,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.1.60,Messenger,"Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,"
3269,3270,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.1.61,Messenger,"Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:"
3270,3271,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.1.62,Messenger,"Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,"
3271,3272,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.1.63,Messenger,"Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost."
3272,3273,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,1.1.64,BEDFORD,"What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?"
3273,3274,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,1.1.65,BEDFORD,"Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns"
3274,3275,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,1.1.66,BEDFORD,Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
3275,3276,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,1.1.67,GLOUCESTER,Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?
3276,3277,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,1.1.68,GLOUCESTER,"If Henry were recall'd to life again,"
3277,3278,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,1.1.69,GLOUCESTER,These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
3278,3279,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,1.1.70,EXETER,How were they lost? what treachery was used?
3279,3280,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.71,Messenger,"No treachery, but want of men and money."
3280,3281,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.72,Messenger,"Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,"
3281,3282,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.73,Messenger,"That here you maintain several factions,"
3282,3283,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.74,Messenger,"And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,"
3283,3284,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.75,Messenger,You are disputing of your generals:
3284,3285,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.76,Messenger,"One would have lingering wars with little cost,"
3285,3286,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.77,Messenger,"Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings,"
3286,3287,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.78,Messenger,"A third thinks, without expense at all,"
3287,3288,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.79,Messenger,By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
3288,3289,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.80,Messenger,"Awake, awake, English nobility!"
3289,3290,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.81,Messenger,Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:
3290,3291,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.82,Messenger,"Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms,"
3291,3292,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.1.83,Messenger,Of England's coat one half is cut away.
3292,3293,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.1.84,EXETER,"Were our tears wanting to this funeral,"
3293,3294,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.1.85,EXETER,These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
3294,3295,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.1.86,BEDFORD,"Me they concern, Regent I am of France."
3295,3296,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.1.87,BEDFORD,Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
3296,3297,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.1.88,BEDFORD,Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
3297,3298,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.1.89,BEDFORD,"Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,"
3298,3299,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.1.90,BEDFORD,To weep their intermissive miseries.
3299,3300,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,,BEDFORD,Enter to them another Messenger
3300,3301,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.1.91,Messenger,"Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance."
3301,3302,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.1.92,Messenger,"France is revolted from the English quite,"
3302,3303,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.1.93,Messenger,Except some petty towns of no import:
3303,3304,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.1.94,Messenger,"The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims,"
3304,3305,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.1.95,Messenger,"The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd,"
3305,3306,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.1.96,Messenger,"Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part,"
3306,3307,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.1.97,Messenger,The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.
3307,3308,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,1.1.98,EXETER,The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
3308,3309,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,1.1.99,EXETER,"O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?"
3309,3310,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.1.100,GLOUCESTER,"We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats."
3310,3311,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.1.101,GLOUCESTER,"Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out."
3311,3312,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.1.102,BEDFORD,"Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?"
3312,3313,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.1.103,BEDFORD,"An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,"
3313,3314,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.1.104,BEDFORD,Wherewith already France is overrun.
3314,3315,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,,BEDFORD,Enter another Messenger
3315,3316,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.1.105,Messenger,"My gracious lords, to add to your laments,"
3316,3317,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.1.106,Messenger,"Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,"
3317,3318,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.1.107,Messenger,I must inform you of a dismal fight
3318,3319,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.1.108,Messenger,Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
3319,3320,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.1.109,Messenger,BISHOP
3320,3321,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,1.1.110,OF WINCHESTER,What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?
3321,3322,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.111,Messenger,"O, no, wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:"
3322,3323,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.112,Messenger,The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
3323,3324,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.113,Messenger,"The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,"
3324,3325,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.114,Messenger,"Retiring from the siege of Orleans,"

3328,3329,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.118,Messenger,"No leisure had he to enrank his men,"
3329,3330,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.119,Messenger,"He wanted pikes to set before his archers,"
3330,3331,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.120,Messenger,Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
3331,3332,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.121,Messenger,"They pitched in the ground confusedly,"
3332,3333,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.122,Messenger,To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
3333,3334,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.123,Messenger,"More than three hours the fight continued,"
3334,3335,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.124,Messenger,Where valiant Talbot above human thought
3335,3336,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.125,Messenger,Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
3336,3337,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.126,Messenger,"Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him,"
3337,3338,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.127,Messenger,"Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:"
3338,3339,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.128,Messenger,"The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms,"
3339,3340,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.129,Messenger,All the whole army stood agazed on him:
3340,3341,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.130,Messenger,His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
3341,3342,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.131,Messenger,A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
3342,3343,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.132,Messenger,And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
3343,3344,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.133,Messenger,"Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,"
3344,3345,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.134,Messenger,If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:
3345,3346,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.135,Messenger,"He, being in the vaward, placed behind"

3347,3348,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.137,Messenger,"Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke."
3348,3349,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.138,Messenger,"Hence grew the general wreck and massacre,"
3349,3350,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.139,Messenger,Enclosed were they with their enemies:
3350,3351,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.140,Messenger,"A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,"
3351,3352,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.141,Messenger,"Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,"
3352,3353,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.142,Messenger,Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
3353,3354,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.1.143,Messenger,Durst not presume to look once in the face.
3354,3355,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,1.1.144,BEDFORD,"Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,"
3355,3356,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,1.1.145,BEDFORD,"For living idly here in pomp and ease,"
3356,3357,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,1.1.146,BEDFORD,"Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,"
3357,3358,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,1.1.147,BEDFORD,Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
3358,3359,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,1.1.148,Messenger,"O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,"
3359,3360,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,1.1.149,Messenger,And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:
3360,3361,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,1.1.150,Messenger,Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
3361,3362,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.151,BEDFORD,His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
3362,3363,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.152,BEDFORD,I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:
3363,3364,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.153,BEDFORD,"His crown shall be the ransom of my friend,"
3364,3365,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.154,BEDFORD,Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
3365,3366,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.155,BEDFORD,"Farewell, my masters, to my task will I,"
3366,3367,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.156,BEDFORD,"Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,"
3367,3368,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.157,BEDFORD,To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
3368,3369,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.158,BEDFORD,"Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,"
3369,3370,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.1.159,BEDFORD,Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
3370,3371,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.1.160,Messenger,"So you had need, for Orleans is besieged,"
3371,3372,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.1.161,Messenger,The English army is grown weak and faint:
3372,3373,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.1.162,Messenger,"The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,"
3373,3374,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.1.163,Messenger,"And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,"
3374,3375,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.1.164,Messenger,"Since they, so few, watch such a multitude."
3375,3376,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,1.1.165,EXETER,"Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,"
3376,3377,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,1.1.166,EXETER,"Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,"
3377,3378,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,1.1.167,EXETER,Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
3378,3379,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,1.1.168,BEDFORD,"I do remember it, and here take my leave,"
3379,3380,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,1.1.169,BEDFORD,To go about my preparation.

3391,3392,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,1.1.178,OF WINCHESTER,"I am left out, for me nothing remains."
3392,3393,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,1.1.179,OF WINCHESTER,But long I will not be Jack out of office:
3393,3394,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,1.1.180,OF WINCHESTER,The king from Eltham I intend to steal
3394,3395,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,1.1.181,OF WINCHESTER,And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.
3395,3396,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,,OF WINCHESTER,Exeunt

3399,3400,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.2.2,CHARLES,"So in the earth, to this day is not known:"
3400,3401,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.2.3,CHARLES,"Late did he shine upon the English side,"
3401,3402,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.2.4,CHARLES,"Now we are victors, upon us he smiles."
3402,3403,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.2.5,CHARLES,What towns of any moment but we have?
3403,3404,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.2.6,CHARLES,"At pleasure here we lie near Orleans,"
3404,3405,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.2.7,CHARLES,"Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,"
3405,3406,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.2.8,CHARLES,Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
3406,3407,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.2.9,ALENCON,They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
3407,3408,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.2.10,ALENCON,Either they must be dieted like mules
3408,3409,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.2.11,ALENCON,And have their provender tied to their mouths
3409,3410,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.2.12,ALENCON,"Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice."
3410,3411,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.2.13,REIGNIER,Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
3411,3412,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.2.14,REIGNIER,"Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:"
3412,3413,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.2.15,REIGNIER,"Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury,"
3413,3414,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.2.16,REIGNIER,"And he may well in fretting spend his gall,"
3414,3415,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.2.17,REIGNIER,Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
3415,3416,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.2.18,CHARLES,"Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them."
3416,3417,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.2.19,CHARLES,Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
3417,3418,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.2.20,CHARLES,Him I forgive my death that killeth me
3418,3419,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.2.21,CHARLES,When he sees me go back one foot or fly.
3419,3420,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,,CHARLES,Exeunt
3420,3421,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,,CHARLES,"Here alarum, they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER"
3421,3422,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.2.22,CHARLES,Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
3422,3423,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.2.23,CHARLES,"Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,"
3423,3424,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.2.24,CHARLES,But that they left me 'midst my enemies.
3424,3425,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.2.25,REIGNIER,"Salisbury is a desperate homicide,"
3425,3426,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.2.26,REIGNIER,He fighteth as one weary of his life.
3426,3427,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.2.27,REIGNIER,"The other lords, like lions wanting food,"
3427,3428,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.2.28,REIGNIER,Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
3428,3429,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.29,ALENCON,"Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,"
3429,3430,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.30,ALENCON,"England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,"
3430,3431,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.31,ALENCON,During the time Edward the Third did reign.
3431,3432,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.32,ALENCON,"More truly now may this be verified,"
3432,3433,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.33,ALENCON,For none but Samsons and Goliases
3433,3434,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.34,ALENCON,It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
3434,3435,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.35,ALENCON,"Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose"
3435,3436,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.2.36,ALENCON,They had such courage and audacity?
3436,3437,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.2.37,CHARLES,"Let's leave this town, for they are hare-brain'd slaves,"
3437,3438,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.2.38,CHARLES,And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
3438,3439,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.2.39,CHARLES,"Of old I know them, rather with their teeth"
3439,3440,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.2.40,CHARLES,The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
3440,3441,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.2.41,REIGNIER,"I think, by some odd gimmors or device"
3441,3442,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.2.42,REIGNIER,"Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on,"
3442,3443,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.2.43,REIGNIER,Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
3443,3444,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.2.44,REIGNIER,"By my consent, we'll even let them alone."
3444,3445,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,1.2.45,ALENCON,Be it so.
3445,3446,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,,ALENCON,Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
3446,3447,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,1.2.46,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
3447,3448,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,1.2.47,CHARLES,"Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us."
3448,3449,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.48,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:"
3449,3450,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.49,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
3450,3451,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.50,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:"
3451,3452,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.51,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"A holy maid hither with me I bring,"
3452,3453,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.52,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
3453,3454,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.53,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
3454,3455,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.54,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
3455,3456,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.55,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,"
3456,3457,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.56,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
3457,3458,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.57,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,What's past and what's to come she can descry.
3458,3459,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.58,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,"
3459,3460,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.2.59,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,For they are certain and unfallible.
3460,3461,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.2.60,CHARLES,"Go, call her in."
3461,3462,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,,CHARLES,Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS
3462,3463,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.2.61,CHARLES,"But first, to try her skill,"
3463,3464,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.2.62,CHARLES,"Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:"
3464,3465,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.2.63,CHARLES,"Question her proudly, let thy looks be stern:"
3465,3466,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.2.64,CHARLES,By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
3466,3467,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,,CHARLES,"Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE"
3467,3468,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.2.65,REIGNIER,"Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?"
3468,3469,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.2.66,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?"
3469,3470,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.2.67,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind,"
3470,3471,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.2.68,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I know thee well, though never seen before."
3471,3472,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.2.69,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:"
3472,3473,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.2.70,JOAN LA PUCELLE,In private will I talk with thee apart.
3473,3474,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,1.2.71,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile."
3474,3475,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,1.2.72,REIGNIER,She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
3475,3476,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,"
3476,3477,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.74,JOAN LA PUCELLE,My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
3477,3478,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.75,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
3478,3479,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To shine on my contemptible estate:
3479,3480,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,"
3480,3481,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.78,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,"
3481,3482,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.79,JOAN LA PUCELLE,God's mother deigned to appear to me
3482,3483,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.80,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And in a vision full of majesty
3483,3484,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.81,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Will'd me to leave my base vocation
3484,3485,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.82,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And free my country from calamity:
3485,3486,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.83,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Her aid she promised and assured success:
3486,3487,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.84,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"In complete glory she reveal'd herself,"
3487,3488,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.85,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And, whereas I was black and swart before,"
3488,3489,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.86,JOAN LA PUCELLE,With those clear rays which she infused on me
3489,3490,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.87,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
3490,3491,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.88,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Ask me what question thou canst possible,"
3491,3492,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.89,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And I will answer unpremeditated:
3492,3493,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.90,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"My courage try by combat, if thou darest,"
3493,3494,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.91,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
3494,3495,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.92,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,"
3495,3496,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,1.2.93,JOAN LA PUCELLE,If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
3496,3497,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.2.94,CHARLES,Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
3497,3498,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.2.95,CHARLES,"Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,"
3498,3499,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.2.96,CHARLES,"In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,"
3499,3500,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.2.97,CHARLES,"And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true,"
3500,3501,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,1.2.98,CHARLES,Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
3501,3502,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.2.99,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,"
3502,3503,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.2.100,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side,"
3503,3504,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.2.101,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's"
3504,3505,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.2.102,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"churchyard,"
3505,3506,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,1.2.103,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
3506,3507,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,1.2.104,CHARLES,"Then come, o' God's name, I fear no woman."
3507,3508,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,1.2.105,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man."
3508,3509,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes"
3509,3510,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,1.2.106,CHARLES,"Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon"
3510,3511,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,1.2.107,CHARLES,And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
3511,3512,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,1.2.108,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak."
3512,3513,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.2.109,CHARLES,"Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:"
3513,3514,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.2.110,CHARLES,"Impatiently I burn with thy desire,"
3514,3515,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.2.111,CHARLES,My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
3515,3516,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.2.112,CHARLES,"Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,"
3516,3517,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.2.113,CHARLES,Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:
3517,3518,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,1.2.114,CHARLES,'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
3518,3519,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.2.115,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I must not yield to any rites of love,"
3519,3520,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.2.116,JOAN LA PUCELLE,For my profession's sacred from above:
3520,3521,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.2.117,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"When I have chased all thy foes from hence,"
3521,3522,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,1.2.118,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Then will I think upon a recompense.
3522,3523,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,1.2.119,CHARLES,Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
3523,3524,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,1.2.120,REIGNIER,"My lord, methinks, is very long in talk."
3524,3525,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,1.2.121,ALENCON,"Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock,"
3525,3526,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,1.2.122,ALENCON,Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
3526,3527,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,1.2.123,REIGNIER,"Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?"
3527,3528,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,1.2.124,ALENCON,He may mean more than we poor men do know:
3528,3529,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,1.2.125,ALENCON,These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
3529,3530,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,1.2.126,REIGNIER,"My lord, where are you? what devise you on?"
3530,3531,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,1.2.127,REIGNIER,"Shall we give over Orleans, or no?"
3531,3532,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,1.2.128,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!"
3532,3533,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,1.2.129,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Fight till the last gasp, I will be your guard."
3533,3534,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,1.2.130,CHARLES,What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
3534,3535,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.131,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
3535,3536,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.132,JOAN LA PUCELLE,This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
3536,3537,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.133,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,"
3537,3538,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.134,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Since I have entered into these wars.
3538,3539,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.135,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Glory is like a circle in the water,"
3539,3540,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.136,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
3540,3541,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.137,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
3541,3542,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.138,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"With Henry's death the English circle ends,"
3542,3543,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.139,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Dispersed are the glories it included.
3543,3544,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.140,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Now am I like that proud insulting ship
3544,3545,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,1.2.141,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
3545,3546,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,1.2.142,CHARLES,Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
3546,3547,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,1.2.143,CHARLES,Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
3547,3548,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,1.2.144,CHARLES,"Helen, the mother of great Constantine,"
3548,3549,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,1.2.145,CHARLES,"Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee."
3549,3550,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,1.2.146,CHARLES,"Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,"
3550,3551,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,1.2.147,CHARLES,How may I reverently worship thee enough?
3551,3552,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,1.2.148,ALENCON,"Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege."
3552,3553,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,1.2.149,REIGNIER,"Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours,"
3553,3554,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,1.2.150,REIGNIER,Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.
3554,3555,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,1.2.151,CHARLES,"Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:"
3555,3556,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,1.2.152,CHARLES,"No prophet will I trust, if she prove false."

3561,3562,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.3.3,GLOUCESTER,"Where be these warders, that they wait not here?"
3562,3563,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.3.4,GLOUCESTER,"Open the gates, 'tis Gloucester that calls."
3563,3564,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.3.5,First Warder,[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?

3669,3670,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.4.4,Boy,Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
3670,3671,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.4.5,Boy,Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:

3692,3693,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.4.24,SALISBURY,How wert thou handled being prisoner?
3693,3694,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.4.25,SALISBURY,Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
3694,3695,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.4.26,SALISBURY,"Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top."

3698,3699,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.30,TALBOT,But with a baser man of arms by far
3699,3700,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.31,TALBOT,Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
3700,3701,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.32,TALBOT,"Which I, disdaining, scorn'd, and craved death,"
3701,3702,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.33,TALBOT,Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
3702,3703,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.34,TALBOT,"In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired."
3703,3704,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.35,TALBOT,"But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,"
3704,3705,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.36,TALBOT,"Whom with my bare fists I would execute,"
3705,3706,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.4.37,TALBOT,If I now had him brought into my power.
3706,3707,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.4.38,SALISBURY,Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
3707,3708,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.39,TALBOT,With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
3708,3709,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.40,TALBOT,"In open market-place produced they me,"
3709,3710,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.41,TALBOT,To be a public spectacle to all:
3710,3711,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.42,TALBOT,"Here, said they, is the terror of the French,"
3711,3712,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.43,TALBOT,The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
3712,3713,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.44,TALBOT,"Then broke I from the officers that led me,"
3713,3714,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.45,TALBOT,"And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,"
3714,3715,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.46,TALBOT,To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
3715,3716,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.47,TALBOT,"My grisly countenance made others fly,"
3716,3717,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.48,TALBOT,None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
3717,3718,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.49,TALBOT,"In iron walls they deem'd me not secure,"
3718,3719,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.50,TALBOT,"So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,"
3719,3720,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.51,TALBOT,"That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,"
3720,3721,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.52,TALBOT,And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
3721,3722,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.53,TALBOT,"Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,"
3722,3723,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.54,TALBOT,"That walked about me every minute-while,"
3723,3724,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.55,TALBOT,"And if I did but stir out of my bed,"
3724,3725,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,1.4.56,TALBOT,Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
3725,3726,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,,TALBOT,Enter the Boy with a linstock
3726,3727,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.57,SALISBURY,"I grieve to hear what torments you endured,"
3727,3728,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.58,SALISBURY,But we will be revenged sufficiently
3728,3729,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.59,SALISBURY,Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
3729,3730,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.60,SALISBURY,"Here, through this grate, I count each one"
3730,3731,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.61,SALISBURY,and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
3731,3732,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.62,SALISBURY,"Let us look in, the sight will much delight thee."
3732,3733,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.63,SALISBURY,"Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,"
3733,3734,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.64,SALISBURY,Let me have your express opinions
3734,3735,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,1.4.65,SALISBURY,Where is best place to make our battery next.
3735,3736,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,1.4.66,GARGRAVE,"I think, at the north gate, for there stand lords."
3736,3737,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,1.4.67,GLANSDALE,"And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge."
3737,3738,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,1.4.68,TALBOT,"For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,"
3738,3739,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,1.4.69,TALBOT,Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
3739,3740,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,,TALBOT,Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall
3740,3741,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,1.4.70,SALISBURY,"O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!"
3741,3742,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,1.4.71,GARGRAVE,"O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!"
3742,3743,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.72,TALBOT,What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
3743,3744,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.73,TALBOT,"Speak, Salisbury, at least, if thou canst speak:"
3744,3745,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.74,TALBOT,"How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?"
3745,3746,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.75,TALBOT,One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
3746,3747,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.76,TALBOT,Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
3747,3748,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.77,TALBOT,That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
3748,3749,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.78,TALBOT,"In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame,"
3749,3750,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.79,TALBOT,"Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars,"
3750,3751,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.80,TALBOT,"Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,"
3751,3752,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.81,TALBOT,His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
3752,3753,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.82,TALBOT,"Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,"
3753,3754,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.83,TALBOT,"One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:"
3754,3755,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.84,TALBOT,The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
3755,3756,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.85,TALBOT,"Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,"
3756,3757,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.86,TALBOT,If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
3757,3758,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.87,TALBOT,"Bear hence his body, I will help to bury it."
3758,3759,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.88,TALBOT,"Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?"
3759,3760,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.89,TALBOT,"Speak unto Talbot, nay, look up to him."
3760,3761,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.90,TALBOT,"Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,"
3761,3762,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.91,TALBOT,Thou shalt not die whiles--
3762,3763,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.92,TALBOT,He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
3763,3764,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.93,TALBOT,"As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,"
3764,3765,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.94,TALBOT,Remember to avenge me on the French.'
3765,3766,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.95,TALBOT,"Plantagenet, I will, and like thee, Nero,"
3766,3767,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.96,TALBOT,"Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:"
3767,3768,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.97,TALBOT,Wretched shall France be only in my name.
3768,3769,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,,TALBOT,"Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens"
3769,3770,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.98,TALBOT,What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?
3770,3771,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,1.4.99,TALBOT,Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
3771,3772,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,,TALBOT,Enter a Messenger
3772,3773,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.4.100,Messenger,"My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:"
3773,3774,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.4.101,Messenger,"The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,"
3774,3775,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.4.102,Messenger,"A holy prophetess new risen up,"
3775,3776,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,1.4.103,Messenger,Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
3776,3777,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,,Messenger,Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans
3777,3778,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.104,TALBOT,"Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!"
3778,3779,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.105,TALBOT,It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
3779,3780,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.106,TALBOT,"Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:"
3780,3781,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.107,TALBOT,"Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,"
3781,3782,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.108,TALBOT,"Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,"
3782,3783,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.109,TALBOT,And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
3783,3784,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.110,TALBOT,"Convey me Salisbury into his tent,"
3784,3785,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,1.4.111,TALBOT,And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
3785,3786,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,,TALBOT,Alarum. Exeunt
3786,3787,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,,TALBOT,SCENE V. The same.
3787,3788,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,,TALBOT,"Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the  DAUPHIN, and driveth him: then enter JOAN LA  PUCELLE, driving Englishmen before her, and exit after them then re-enter TALBOT"

3789,3790,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.5.2,TALBOT,"Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:"
3790,3791,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.5.3,TALBOT,A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
3791,3792,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,,TALBOT,Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
3792,3793,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.5.4,TALBOT,"Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee,"
3793,3794,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.5.5,TALBOT,"Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:"
3794,3795,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.5.6,TALBOT,"Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,"
3795,3796,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.5.7,TALBOT,And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.
3796,3797,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.5.8,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee."
3797,3798,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Here they fight
3798,3799,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.5.9,TALBOT,"Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?"
3799,3800,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.5.10,TALBOT,My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage
3800,3801,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.5.11,TALBOT,And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.
3801,3802,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.5.12,TALBOT,But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
3802,3803,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,,TALBOT,They fight again
3803,3804,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.5.13,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Talbot, farewell, thy hour is not yet come:"
3804,3805,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.5.14,JOAN LA PUCELLE,I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
3805,3806,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.5.14,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"A short alarum, then enter the town with soldiers"
3806,3807,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.5.15,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O'ertake me, if thou canst, I scorn thy strength."
3807,3808,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.5.16,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men,"
3808,3809,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.5.17,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Help Salisbury to make his testament:
3809,3810,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.5.18,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"This day is ours, as many more shall be."
3810,3811,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Exit
3811,3812,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.19,TALBOT,"My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel,"
3812,3813,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.20,TALBOT,"I know not where I am, nor what I do,"
3813,3814,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.21,TALBOT,"A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,"
3814,3815,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.22,TALBOT,Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:
3815,3816,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.23,TALBOT,So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
3816,3817,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.24,TALBOT,Are from their hives and houses driven away.
3817,3818,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.25,TALBOT,"They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs,"
3818,3819,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.26,TALBOT,"Now, like to whelps, we crying run away."
3819,3820,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,,TALBOT,A short alarum
3820,3821,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.27,TALBOT,"Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,"
3821,3822,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.28,TALBOT,"Or tear the lions out of England's coat,"
3822,3823,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.29,TALBOT,"Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:"
3823,3824,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.30,TALBOT,"Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,"
3824,3825,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.31,TALBOT,"Or horse or oxen from the leopard,"
3825,3826,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.32,TALBOT,As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.
3826,3827,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,,TALBOT,Alarum. Here another skirmish
3827,3828,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.33,TALBOT,It will not be: retire into your trenches:
3828,3829,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.34,TALBOT,"You all consented unto Salisbury's death,"
3829,3830,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.35,TALBOT,For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
3830,3831,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.36,TALBOT,"Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,"
3831,3832,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.37,TALBOT,In spite of us or aught that we could do.
3832,3833,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.38,TALBOT,"O, would I were to die with Salisbury!"
3833,3834,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.39,TALBOT,The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
3834,3835,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.5.39,TALBOT,"Exit TALBOT. Alarum, retreat, flourish"

3836,3837,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,,TALBOT,"Enter, on the walls, JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, REIGNIER, ALENCON, and Soldiers"
3837,3838,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.6.1,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Advance our waving colours on the walls,"
3838,3839,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.6.2,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Rescued is Orleans from the English
3839,3840,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,1.6.3,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.
3840,3841,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.6.4,CHARLES,"Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,"
3841,3842,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.6.5,CHARLES,How shall I honour thee for this success?
3842,3843,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.6.6,CHARLES,Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
3843,3844,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.6.7,CHARLES,That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
3844,3845,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.6.8,CHARLES,"France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!"
3845,3846,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.6.9,CHARLES,Recover'd is the town of Orleans:
3846,3847,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,1.6.10,CHARLES,More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.
3847,3848,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.6.11,REIGNIER,Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
3848,3849,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.6.12,REIGNIER,"Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires"
3849,3850,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.6.13,REIGNIER,"And feast and banquet in the open streets,"
3850,3851,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,1.6.14,REIGNIER,To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.
3851,3852,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.6.15,ALENCON,"All France will be replete with mirth and joy,"
3852,3853,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,1.6.16,ALENCON,When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.
3853,3854,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.17,CHARLES,"'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won,"
3854,3855,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.18,CHARLES,"For which I will divide my crown with her,"
3855,3856,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.19,CHARLES,And all the priests and friars in my realm
3856,3857,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.20,CHARLES,Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
3857,3858,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.21,CHARLES,A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
3858,3859,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.22,CHARLES,Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:
3859,3860,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.23,CHARLES,"In memory of her when she is dead,"
3860,3861,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.24,CHARLES,"Her ashes, in an urn more precious"
3861,3862,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.25,CHARLES,"Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,"
3862,3863,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.26,CHARLES,Transported shall be at high festivals
3863,3864,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.27,CHARLES,Before the kings and queens of France.
3864,3865,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.28,CHARLES,"No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,"
3865,3866,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.29,CHARLES,But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.
3866,3867,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,1.6.30,CHARLES,"Come in, and let us banquet royally,"

3873,3874,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.1.2,Sergeant,If any noise or soldier you perceive
3874,3875,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.1.3,Sergeant,"Near to the walls, by some apparent sign"
3875,3876,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.1.4,Sergeant,Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
3876,3877,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.1.5,First Sentinel,"Sergeant, you shall."
3877,3878,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,,First Sentinel,Exit Sergeant
3878,3879,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.1.6,First Sentinel,"Thus are poor servitors,"
3879,3880,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.1.7,First Sentinel,"When others sleep upon their quiet beds,"
3880,3881,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.1.8,First Sentinel,"Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold."
3881,3882,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,,First Sentinel,"Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with scaling-ladders, their drums beating a dead march"
3882,3883,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.9,TALBOT,"Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,"
3883,3884,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.10,TALBOT,"By whose approach the regions of Artois,"
3884,3885,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.11,TALBOT,"Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,"
3885,3886,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.12,TALBOT,"This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,"
3886,3887,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.13,TALBOT,Having all day caroused and banqueted:
3887,3888,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.14,TALBOT,Embrace we then this opportunity
3888,3889,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.15,TALBOT,As fitting best to quittance their deceit
3889,3890,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.1.16,TALBOT,Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.
3890,3891,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.1.17,BEDFORD,"Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,"
3891,3892,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.1.18,BEDFORD,"Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,"
3892,3893,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.1.19,BEDFORD,To join with witches and the help of hell!
3893,3894,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.1.20,BURGUNDY,Traitors have never other company.
3894,3895,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.1.21,BURGUNDY,But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?
3895,3896,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.1.22,TALBOT,"A maid, they say."
3896,3897,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.1.23,BEDFORD,A maid! and be so martial!
3897,3898,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.1.24,BURGUNDY,"Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,"
3898,3899,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.1.25,BURGUNDY,If underneath the standard of the French
3899,3900,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.1.26,BURGUNDY,She carry armour as she hath begun.
3900,3901,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.1.27,TALBOT,"Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:"
3901,3902,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.1.28,TALBOT,"God is our fortress, in whose conquering name"
3902,3903,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.1.29,TALBOT,Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.
3903,3904,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.1.30,BEDFORD,"Ascend, brave Talbot, we will follow thee."
3904,3905,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.1.31,TALBOT,"Not all together: better far, I guess,"
3905,3906,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.1.32,TALBOT,"That we do make our entrance several ways,"
3906,3907,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.1.33,TALBOT,"That, if it chance the one of us do fail,"
3907,3908,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.1.34,TALBOT,The other yet may rise against their force.
3908,3909,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,2.1.35,BEDFORD,Agreed: I'll to yond corner.
3909,3910,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.1.36,BURGUNDY,And I to this.
3910,3911,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.1.37,TALBOT,"And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave."
3911,3912,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.1.38,TALBOT,"Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right"
3912,3913,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.1.39,TALBOT,"Of English Henry, shall this night appear"
3913,3914,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.1.40,TALBOT,How much in duty I am bound to both.
3914,3915,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.1.41,Sentinels,Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
3915,3916,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.1.41,Sentinels,"Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.'"
3916,3917,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,,Sentinels,"The French leap over the walls in their shirts.  Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready"
3917,3918,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,2.1.42,ALENCON,"How now, my lords! what, all unready so?"
3918,3919,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.1.43,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well."
3919,3920,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.1.44,REIGNIER,"'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,"
3920,3921,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.1.45,REIGNIER,Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.
3921,3922,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,2.1.46,ALENCON,"Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,"
3922,3923,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,2.1.47,ALENCON,Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
3923,3924,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,2.1.48,ALENCON,More venturous or desperate than this.
3924,3925,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,2.1.49,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
3925,3926,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.1.50,REIGNIER,"If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him."
3926,3927,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,2.1.51,ALENCON,Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
3927,3928,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.1.52,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard."
3928,3929,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE
3929,3930,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.1.53,CHARLES,"Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?"
3930,3931,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.1.54,CHARLES,"Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,"
3931,3932,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.1.55,CHARLES,"Make us partakers of a little gain,"
3932,3933,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.1.56,CHARLES,That now our loss might be ten times so much?
3933,3934,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.1.57,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!
3934,3935,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.1.58,JOAN LA PUCELLE,At all times will you have my power alike?
3935,3936,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.1.59,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,"
3936,3937,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.1.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
3937,3938,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.1.61,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,"
3938,3939,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.1.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
3939,3940,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,2.1.63,CHARLES,"Duke of Alencon, this was your default,"
3940,3941,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,2.1.64,CHARLES,"That, being captain of the watch to-night,"
3941,3942,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,2.1.65,CHARLES,Did look no better to that weighty charge.
3942,3943,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,2.1.66,ALENCON,Had all your quarters been as safely kept
3943,3944,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,2.1.67,ALENCON,"As that whereof I had the government,"
3944,3945,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,2.1.68,ALENCON,We had not been thus shamefully surprised.
3945,3946,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,2.1.69,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Mine was secure.
3946,3947,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,2.1.70,REIGNIER,"And so was mine, my lord."
3947,3948,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,2.1.71,CHARLES,"And, for myself, most part of all this night,"
3948,3949,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,2.1.72,CHARLES,Within her quarter and mine own precinct
3949,3950,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,2.1.73,CHARLES,"I was employ'd in passing to and fro,"
3950,3951,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,2.1.74,CHARLES,About relieving of the sentinels:
3951,3952,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,2.1.75,CHARLES,Then how or which way should they first break in?
3952,3953,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,2.1.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Question, my lords, no further of the case,"
3953,3954,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,2.1.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place
3954,3955,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,2.1.78,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But weakly guarded, where the breach was made."
3955,3956,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,2.1.79,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And now there rests no other shift but this,"
3956,3957,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,2.1.80,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,"
3957,3958,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,2.1.81,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And lay new platforms to endamage them.
3958,3959,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,2.1.81,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A  Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their clothes behind"
3959,3960,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,2.1.82,Soldier,I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
3960,3961,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,2.1.83,Soldier,"The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword,"
3961,3962,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,2.1.84,Soldier,"For I have loaden me with many spoils,"
3962,3963,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,2.1.85,Soldier,Using no other weapon but his name.
3963,3964,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,,Soldier,Exit
3964,3965,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,,Soldier,SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town.
3965,3966,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,,Soldier,"Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others"
3966,3967,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.2.1,BEDFORD,"The day begins to break, and night is fled,"
3967,3968,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.2.2,BEDFORD,Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
3968,3969,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.2.3,BEDFORD,"Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit."
3969,3970,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,,BEDFORD,Retreat sounded
3970,3971,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.4,TALBOT,"Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,"
3971,3972,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.5,TALBOT,"And here advance it in the market-place,"
3972,3973,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.6,TALBOT,The middle centre of this cursed town.
3973,3974,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.7,TALBOT,"Now have I paid my vow unto his soul,"
3974,3975,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.8,TALBOT,"For every drop of blood was drawn from him,"
3975,3976,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.9,TALBOT,There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
3976,3977,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.10,TALBOT,And that hereafter ages may behold
3977,3978,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.11,TALBOT,"What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,"
3978,3979,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.12,TALBOT,Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
3979,3980,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.13,TALBOT,"A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:"
3980,3981,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.14,TALBOT,"Upon the which, that every one may read,"
3981,3982,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.15,TALBOT,"Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,"
3982,3983,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.16,TALBOT,The treacherous manner of his mournful death
3983,3984,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.17,TALBOT,And what a terror he had been to France.
3984,3985,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.18,TALBOT,"But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,"
3985,3986,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.19,TALBOT,"I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,"
3986,3987,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.20,TALBOT,"His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,"
3987,3988,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.2.21,TALBOT,Nor any of his false confederates.
3988,3989,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.2.22,BEDFORD,"'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,"
3989,3990,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.2.23,BEDFORD,"Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,"
3990,3991,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.2.24,BEDFORD,They did amongst the troops of armed men
3991,3992,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.2.25,BEDFORD,Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
3992,3993,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.26,BURGUNDY,"Myself, as far as I could well discern"
3993,3994,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.27,BURGUNDY,"For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,"
3994,3995,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.28,BURGUNDY,"Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,"
3995,3996,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.29,BURGUNDY,"When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,"
3996,3997,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.30,BURGUNDY,Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
3997,3998,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.31,BURGUNDY,That could not live asunder day or night.
3998,3999,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.32,BURGUNDY,"After that things are set in order here,"
3999,4000,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.2.33,BURGUNDY,We'll follow them with all the power we have.
4000,4001,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,,BURGUNDY,Enter a Messenger
4001,4002,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.2.34,Messenger,"All hail, my lords! which of this princely train"
4002,4003,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.2.35,Messenger,"Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts"
4003,4004,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.2.36,Messenger,So much applauded through the realm of France?
4004,4005,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.2.37,TALBOT,Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
4005,4006,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.2.38,Messenger,"The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,"
4006,4007,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.2.39,Messenger,"With modesty admiring thy renown,"
4007,4008,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.2.40,Messenger,"By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe"
4008,4009,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.2.41,Messenger,"To visit her poor castle where she lies,"
4009,4010,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.2.42,Messenger,That she may boast she hath beheld the man
4010,4011,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.2.43,Messenger,Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
4011,4012,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.2.44,BURGUNDY,"Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars"
4012,4013,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.2.45,BURGUNDY,"Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,"
4013,4014,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.2.46,BURGUNDY,When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
4014,4015,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.2.47,BURGUNDY,"You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit."
4015,4016,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.2.48,TALBOT,"Ne'er trust me then, for when a world of men"
4016,4017,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.2.49,TALBOT,"Could not prevail with all their oratory,"
4017,4018,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.2.50,TALBOT,Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:
4018,4019,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.2.51,TALBOT,"And therefore tell her I return great thanks,"
4019,4020,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.2.52,TALBOT,And in submission will attend on her.
4020,4021,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.2.53,TALBOT,Will not your honours bear me company?
4021,4022,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.2.54,BEDFORD,"No, truly, it is more than manners will:"
4022,4023,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.2.55,BEDFORD,"And I have heard it said, unbidden guests"
4023,4024,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.2.56,BEDFORD,Are often welcomest when they are gone.
4024,4025,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.2.57,TALBOT,"Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,"
4025,4026,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.2.58,TALBOT,I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
4026,4027,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.2.59,TALBOT,"Come hither, captain."
4027,4028,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,,TALBOT,Whispers
4028,4029,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.2.60,TALBOT,You perceive my mind?
4029,4030,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,2.2.61,Captain,"I do, my lord, and mean accordingly."
4030,4031,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,,Captain,Exeunt

4034,4035,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.3.2,OF AUVERGNE,"Porter, remember what I gave in charge,"
4035,4036,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.3.3,OF AUVERGNE,"And when you have done so, bring the keys to me."
4036,4037,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.3.4,Porter,"Madam, I will."
4037,4038,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,,Porter,Exit
4038,4039,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.3.5,Porter,COUNTESS
4039,4040,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.3.6,OF AUVERGNE,"The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,"
4040,4041,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.3.7,OF AUVERGNE,I shall as famous be by this exploit
4041,4042,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.3.8,OF AUVERGNE,As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
4042,4043,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.3.9,OF AUVERGNE,"Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,"
4043,4044,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.3.10,OF AUVERGNE,And his achievements of no less account:
4044,4045,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.3.11,OF AUVERGNE,"Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,"
4045,4046,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.3.12,OF AUVERGNE,To give their censure of these rare reports.
4046,4047,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,,OF AUVERGNE,Enter Messenger and TALBOT
4047,4048,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.3.13,Messenger,"Madam,"
4048,4049,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.3.14,Messenger,"According as your ladyship desired,"
4049,4050,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.3.15,Messenger,"By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come."
4050,4051,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.3.16,Messenger,COUNTESS
4051,4052,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.3.17,OF AUVERGNE,And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
4052,4053,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.3.18,Messenger,"Madam, it is."
4053,4054,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.3.19,Messenger,COUNTESS
4054,4055,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.20,OF AUVERGNE,Is this the scourge of France?
4055,4056,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.21,OF AUVERGNE,"Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad"
4056,4057,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.22,OF AUVERGNE,That with his name the mothers still their babes?
4057,4058,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.23,OF AUVERGNE,I see report is fabulous and false:
4058,4059,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.24,OF AUVERGNE,"I thought I should have seen some Hercules,"
4059,4060,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.25,OF AUVERGNE,"A second Hector, for his grim aspect,"
4060,4061,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.26,OF AUVERGNE,And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
4061,4062,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.27,OF AUVERGNE,"Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!"
4062,4063,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.28,OF AUVERGNE,It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
4063,4064,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.3.29,OF AUVERGNE,Should strike such terror to his enemies.
4064,4065,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.3.30,TALBOT,"Madam, I have been bold to trouble you,"
4065,4066,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.3.31,TALBOT,"But since your ladyship is not at leisure,"
4066,4067,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.3.32,TALBOT,I'll sort some other time to visit you.
4067,4068,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.3.33,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4068,4069,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.3.34,OF AUVERGNE,What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.
4069,4070,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.3.35,Messenger,"Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves"
4070,4071,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.3.36,Messenger,To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
4071,4072,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.3.37,TALBOT,"Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,"
4072,4073,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.3.38,TALBOT,I go to certify her Talbot's here.
4073,4074,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,,TALBOT,Re-enter Porter with keys
4074,4075,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.3.39,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4075,4076,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,2.3.40,OF AUVERGNE,"If thou be he, then art thou prisoner."
4076,4077,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.3.41,TALBOT,Prisoner! to whom?
4077,4078,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.3.42,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4078,4079,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.43,OF AUVERGNE,"To me, blood-thirsty lord,"
4079,4080,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.44,OF AUVERGNE,And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
4080,4081,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.45,OF AUVERGNE,"Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,"
4081,4082,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.46,OF AUVERGNE,For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
4082,4083,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.47,OF AUVERGNE,"But now the substance shall endure the like,"
4083,4084,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.48,OF AUVERGNE,"And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,"
4084,4085,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.49,OF AUVERGNE,That hast by tyranny these many years
4085,4086,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.50,OF AUVERGNE,"Wasted our country, slain our citizens"
4086,4087,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.3.51,OF AUVERGNE,And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
4087,4088,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.3.52,TALBOT,"Ha, ha, ha!"
4088,4089,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.3.53,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4089,4090,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,2.3.54,OF AUVERGNE,"Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan."
4090,4091,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.3.55,TALBOT,I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
4091,4092,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.3.56,TALBOT,To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
4092,4093,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.3.57,TALBOT,Whereon to practise your severity.
4093,4094,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.3.58,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4094,4095,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.3.59,OF AUVERGNE,"Why, art not thou the man?"
4095,4096,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,2.3.60,TALBOT,I am indeed.
4096,4097,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,2.3.61,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4097,4098,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,2.3.62,OF AUVERGNE,Then have I substance too.
4098,4099,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.63,TALBOT,"No, no, I am but shadow of myself:"
4099,4100,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.64,TALBOT,"You are deceived, my substance is not here,"
4100,4101,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.65,TALBOT,For what you see is but the smallest part
4101,4102,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.66,TALBOT,And least proportion of humanity:
4102,4103,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.67,TALBOT,"I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,"
4103,4104,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.68,TALBOT,"It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,"
4104,4105,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.69,TALBOT,Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.
4105,4106,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.3.70,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4106,4107,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,2.3.71,OF AUVERGNE,"This is a riddling merchant for the nonce,"
4107,4108,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,2.3.72,OF AUVERGNE,"He will be here, and yet he is not here:"
4108,4109,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,2.3.73,OF AUVERGNE,How can these contrarieties agree?
4109,4110,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.74,TALBOT,That will I show you presently.
4110,4111,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.74,TALBOT,Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers
4111,4112,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.75,TALBOT,"How say you, madam? are you now persuaded"
4112,4113,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.76,TALBOT,That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
4113,4114,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.77,TALBOT,"These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,"
4114,4115,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.78,TALBOT,"With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,"
4115,4116,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.79,TALBOT,Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
4116,4117,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.80,TALBOT,And in a moment makes them desolate.
4117,4118,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.3.81,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4118,4119,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.3.82,OF AUVERGNE,Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
4119,4120,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.3.83,OF AUVERGNE,I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
4120,4121,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.3.84,OF AUVERGNE,And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
4121,4122,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.3.85,OF AUVERGNE,"Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,"
4122,4123,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.3.86,OF AUVERGNE,For I am sorry that with reverence
4123,4124,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.3.87,OF AUVERGNE,I did not entertain thee as thou art.
4124,4125,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.88,TALBOT,"Be not dismay'd, fair lady, nor misconstrue"
4125,4126,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.89,TALBOT,"The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake"
4126,4127,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.90,TALBOT,The outward composition of his body.
4127,4128,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.91,TALBOT,"What you have done hath not offended me,"
4128,4129,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.92,TALBOT,"Nor other satisfaction do I crave,"
4129,4130,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.93,TALBOT,"But only, with your patience, that we may"
4130,4131,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.94,TALBOT,"Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,"
4131,4132,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.95,TALBOT,For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
4132,4133,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,2.3.96,TALBOT,COUNTESS
4133,4134,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,2.3.97,OF AUVERGNE,"With all my heart, and think me honoured"
4134,4135,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,2.3.98,OF AUVERGNE,To feast so great a warrior in my house.

4138,4139,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,2.4.1,OF AUVERGNE,RICHARD
4139,4140,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.4.2,PLANTAGENET,"Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?"
4140,4141,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.4.3,PLANTAGENET,Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
4141,4142,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.4.4,SUFFOLK,"Within the Temple-hall we were too loud,"
4142,4143,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.4.5,SUFFOLK,The garden here is more convenient.
4143,4144,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.4.6,SUFFOLK,RICHARD
4144,4145,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.4.7,PLANTAGENET,"Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth,"
4145,4146,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.4.8,PLANTAGENET,Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
4146,4147,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.4.9,SUFFOLK,"Faith, I have been a truant in the law,"
4147,4148,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.4.10,SUFFOLK,"And never yet could frame my will to it,"
4148,4149,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.4.11,SUFFOLK,And therefore frame the law unto my will.
4149,4150,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.4.12,SOMERSET,"Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us."
4150,4151,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.13,WARWICK,"Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,"
4151,4152,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.14,WARWICK,"Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,"
4152,4153,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.15,WARWICK,"Between two blades, which bears the better temper:"
4153,4154,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.16,WARWICK,"Between two horses, which doth bear him best,"
4154,4155,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.17,WARWICK,"Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye,"
4155,4156,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.18,WARWICK,"I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement,"
4156,4157,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.19,WARWICK,"But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,"
4157,4158,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.20,WARWICK,"Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw."
4158,4159,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.4.21,WARWICK,RICHARD
4159,4160,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.4.22,PLANTAGENET,"Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:"
4160,4161,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.4.23,PLANTAGENET,The truth appears so naked on my side
4161,4162,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.4.24,PLANTAGENET,That any purblind eye may find it out.
4162,4163,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.4.25,SOMERSET,"And on my side it is so well apparell'd,"
4163,4164,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.4.26,SOMERSET,"So clear, so shining and so evident"
4164,4165,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.4.27,SOMERSET,That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
4165,4166,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.4.28,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4166,4167,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.4.29,PLANTAGENET,"Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,"
4167,4168,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.4.30,PLANTAGENET,In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
4168,4169,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.4.31,PLANTAGENET,Let him that is a true-born gentleman
4169,4170,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.4.32,PLANTAGENET,"And stands upon the honour of his birth,"
4170,4171,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.4.33,PLANTAGENET,"If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,"
4171,4172,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.4.34,PLANTAGENET,From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
4172,4173,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.4.35,SOMERSET,"Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,"
4173,4174,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.4.36,SOMERSET,"But dare maintain the party of the truth,"
4174,4175,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.4.37,SOMERSET,Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
4175,4176,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.4.38,WARWICK,"I love no colours, and without all colour"
4176,4177,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.4.39,WARWICK,Of base insinuating flattery
4177,4178,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.4.40,WARWICK,I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
4178,4179,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,2.4.41,SUFFOLK,I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
4179,4180,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,2.4.42,SUFFOLK,And say withal I think he held the right.
4180,4181,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.4.43,VERNON,"Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,"
4181,4182,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.4.44,VERNON,Till you conclude that he upon whose side
4182,4183,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.4.45,VERNON,The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
4183,4184,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.4.46,VERNON,Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
4184,4185,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.4.47,SOMERSET,"Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:"
4185,4186,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.4.48,SOMERSET,"If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence."
4186,4187,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.4.49,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4187,4188,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.4.50,PLANTAGENET,And I.
4188,4189,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,2.4.51,VERNON,Then for the truth and plainness of the case.
4189,4190,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,2.4.52,VERNON,"I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,"
4190,4191,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,2.4.53,VERNON,Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
4191,4192,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.4.54,SOMERSET,"Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,"
4192,4193,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.4.55,SOMERSET,Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
4193,4194,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.4.56,SOMERSET,"And fall on my side so, against your will."
4194,4195,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.4.57,VERNON,"If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,"
4195,4196,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.4.58,VERNON,Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
4196,4197,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.4.59,VERNON,And keep me on the side where still I am.
4197,4198,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,2.4.60,SOMERSET,"Well, well, come on: who else?"
4198,4199,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,2.4.61,Lawyer,"Unless my study and my books be false,"
4199,4200,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,2.4.62,Lawyer,The argument you held was wrong in you:
4200,4201,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,,Lawyer,To SOMERSET
4201,4202,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,2.4.63,Lawyer,In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
4202,4203,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,2.4.64,Lawyer,RICHARD
4203,4204,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,2.4.65,PLANTAGENET,"Now, Somerset, where is your argument?"
4204,4205,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,2.4.66,SOMERSET,"Here in my scabbard, meditating that"
4205,4206,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,2.4.67,SOMERSET,Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
4206,4207,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,2.4.68,SOMERSET,RICHARD
4207,4208,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.4.69,PLANTAGENET,"Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,"
4208,4209,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.4.70,PLANTAGENET,"For pale they look with fear, as witnessing"
4209,4210,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,2.4.71,PLANTAGENET,The truth on our side.
4210,4211,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.4.72,SOMERSET,"No, Plantagenet,"
4211,4212,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.4.73,SOMERSET,'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
4212,4213,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.4.74,SOMERSET,"Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,"
4213,4214,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.4.75,SOMERSET,And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
4214,4215,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,2.4.76,SOMERSET,RICHARD

4218,4219,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,2.4.80,PLANTAGENET,"Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,"
4219,4220,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,2.4.81,PLANTAGENET,Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
4220,4221,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,2.4.82,SOMERSET,"Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,"
4221,4222,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,2.4.83,SOMERSET,"That shall maintain what I have said is true,"
4222,4223,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,2.4.84,SOMERSET,Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.

4303,4304,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.8,MORTIMER,"These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,"
4304,4305,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.9,MORTIMER,"Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent,"
4305,4306,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.10,MORTIMER,"Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,"
4306,4307,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.11,MORTIMER,"And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine"
4307,4308,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.12,MORTIMER,"That droops his sapless branches to the ground,"
4308,4309,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.13,MORTIMER,"Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,"
4309,4310,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.14,MORTIMER,"Unable to support this lump of clay,"
4310,4311,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.15,MORTIMER,"Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,"
4311,4312,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.16,MORTIMER,As witting I no other comfort have.
4312,4313,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,2.5.17,MORTIMER,"But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?"
4313,4314,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.5.18,First Gaoler,"Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:"
4314,4315,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.5.19,First Gaoler,"We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,"
4315,4316,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,2.5.20,First Gaoler,And answer was return'd that he will come.
4316,4317,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.21,MORTIMER,Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
4317,4318,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.22,MORTIMER,Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
4318,4319,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.23,MORTIMER,"Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,"
4319,4320,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.24,MORTIMER,"Before whose glory I was great in arms,"
4320,4321,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.25,MORTIMER,This loathsome sequestration have I had:
4321,4322,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.26,MORTIMER,"And even since then hath Richard been obscured,"
4322,4323,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.27,MORTIMER,Deprived of honour and inheritance.
4323,4324,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.28,MORTIMER,"But now the arbitrator of despairs,"
4324,4325,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.29,MORTIMER,"Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,"
4325,4326,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.30,MORTIMER,With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:
4326,4327,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.31,MORTIMER,"I would his troubles likewise were expired,"
4327,4328,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,2.5.32,MORTIMER,That so he might recover what was lost.
4328,4329,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,,MORTIMER,Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
4329,4330,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,2.5.33,First Gaoler,"My lord, your loving nephew now is come."
4330,4331,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.5.34,MORTIMER,"Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?"
4331,4332,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,2.5.35,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4332,4333,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.5.36,PLANTAGENET,"Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,"
4333,4334,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,2.5.37,PLANTAGENET,"Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes."
4334,4335,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.5.38,MORTIMER,"Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,"
4335,4336,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.5.39,MORTIMER,And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:
4336,4337,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.5.40,MORTIMER,"O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,"
4337,4338,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.5.41,MORTIMER,That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
4338,4339,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.5.42,MORTIMER,"And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,"
4339,4340,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.5.43,MORTIMER,"Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?"
4340,4341,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,2.5.44,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4341,4342,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.45,PLANTAGENET,"First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,"
4342,4343,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.46,PLANTAGENET,"And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease."
4343,4344,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.47,PLANTAGENET,"This day, in argument upon a case,"
4344,4345,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.48,PLANTAGENET,"Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me,"
4345,4346,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.49,PLANTAGENET,Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
4346,4347,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.50,PLANTAGENET,And did upbraid me with my father's death:
4347,4348,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.51,PLANTAGENET,"Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,"
4348,4349,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.52,PLANTAGENET,Else with the like I had requited him.
4349,4350,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.53,PLANTAGENET,"Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,"
4350,4351,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.54,PLANTAGENET,In honour of a true Plantagenet
4351,4352,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.55,PLANTAGENET,"And for alliance sake, declare the cause"
4352,4353,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,2.5.56,PLANTAGENET,"My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head."
4353,4354,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.5.57,MORTIMER,"That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me"
4354,4355,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.5.58,MORTIMER,And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
4355,4356,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.5.59,MORTIMER,"Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,"
4356,4357,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.5.60,MORTIMER,Was cursed instrument of his decease.
4357,4358,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,2.5.61,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4358,4359,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.5.62,PLANTAGENET,"Discover more at large what cause that was,"
4359,4360,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,2.5.63,PLANTAGENET,For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
4360,4361,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.64,MORTIMER,"I will, if that my fading breath permit"
4361,4362,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.65,MORTIMER,And death approach not ere my tale be done.
4362,4363,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.66,MORTIMER,"Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,"
4363,4364,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.67,MORTIMER,"Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,"
4364,4365,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.68,MORTIMER,"The first-begotten and the lawful heir,"
4365,4366,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.69,MORTIMER,"Of Edward king, the third of that descent:"
4366,4367,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.70,MORTIMER,"During whose reign the Percies of the north,"
4367,4368,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.71,MORTIMER,"Finding his usurpation most unjust,"
4368,4369,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.72,MORTIMER,Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
4369,4370,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.73,MORTIMER,The reason moved these warlike lords to this
4370,4371,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.74,MORTIMER,"Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,"
4371,4372,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.75,MORTIMER,Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
4372,4373,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.76,MORTIMER,"I was the next by birth and parentage,"
4373,4374,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.77,MORTIMER,For by my mother I derived am
4374,4375,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.78,MORTIMER,"From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son"
4375,4376,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.79,MORTIMER,"To King Edward the Third, whereas he"
4376,4377,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.80,MORTIMER,"From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,"
4377,4378,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.81,MORTIMER,Being but fourth of that heroic line.
4378,4379,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.82,MORTIMER,But mark: as in this haughty attempt
4379,4380,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.83,MORTIMER,"They laboured to plant the rightful heir,"
4380,4381,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.84,MORTIMER,I lost my liberty and they their lives.
4381,4382,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.85,MORTIMER,"Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,"
4382,4383,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.86,MORTIMER,"Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,"
4383,4384,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.87,MORTIMER,"Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived"
4384,4385,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.88,MORTIMER,"From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,"
4385,4386,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.89,MORTIMER,"Marrying my sister that thy mother was,"
4386,4387,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.90,MORTIMER,Again in pity of my hard distress
4387,4388,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.91,MORTIMER,"Levied an army, weening to redeem"
4388,4389,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.92,MORTIMER,And have install'd me in the diadem:
4389,4390,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.93,MORTIMER,"But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl"
4390,4391,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.94,MORTIMER,"And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,"
4391,4392,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.95,MORTIMER,"In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd."
4392,4393,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,2.5.96,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4393,4394,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,2.5.97,PLANTAGENET,"Of which, my lord, your honour is the last."
4394,4395,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.5.98,MORTIMER,"True, and thou seest that I no issue have"
4395,4396,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.5.99,MORTIMER,"And that my fainting words do warrant death,"
4396,4397,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.5.100,MORTIMER,"Thou art my heir, the rest I wish thee gather:"
4397,4398,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.5.101,MORTIMER,But yet be wary in thy studious care.
4398,4399,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,2.5.102,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4399,4400,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.5.103,PLANTAGENET,Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:
4400,4401,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.5.104,PLANTAGENET,"But yet, methinks, my father's execution"
4401,4402,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,2.5.105,PLANTAGENET,Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
4402,4403,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.5.106,MORTIMER,"With silence, nephew, be thou politic:"
4403,4404,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.5.107,MORTIMER,"Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,"
4404,4405,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.5.108,MORTIMER,"And like a mountain, not to be removed."
4405,4406,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.5.109,MORTIMER,But now thy uncle is removing hence:
4406,4407,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.5.110,MORTIMER,"As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd"
4407,4408,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.5.111,MORTIMER,With long continuance in a settled place.
4408,4409,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,2.5.112,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4409,4410,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,2.5.113,PLANTAGENET,"O, uncle, would some part of my young years"
4410,4411,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,2.5.114,PLANTAGENET,Might but redeem the passage of your age!
4411,4412,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.5.115,MORTIMER,"Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth"
4412,4413,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.5.116,MORTIMER,Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
4413,4414,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.5.117,MORTIMER,"Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good,"
4414,4415,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.5.118,MORTIMER,Only give order for my funeral:
4415,4416,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.5.119,MORTIMER,"And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes"
4416,4417,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.5.120,MORTIMER,And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!
4417,4418,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,,MORTIMER,Dies
4418,4419,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,2.5.121,MORTIMER,RICHARD
4419,4420,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.122,PLANTAGENET,"And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!"
4420,4421,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.123,PLANTAGENET,In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
4421,4422,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.124,PLANTAGENET,And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
4422,4423,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.125,PLANTAGENET,"Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,"
4423,4424,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.126,PLANTAGENET,And what I do imagine let that rest.
4424,4425,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.127,PLANTAGENET,"Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself"
4425,4426,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.128,PLANTAGENET,Will see his burial better than his life.
4426,4427,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,,PLANTAGENET,"Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER"
4427,4428,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.129,PLANTAGENET,"Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,"
4428,4429,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.130,PLANTAGENET,Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
4429,4430,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.131,PLANTAGENET,"And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,"
4430,4431,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.132,PLANTAGENET,Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:
4431,4432,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.133,PLANTAGENET,"I doubt not but with honour to redress,"
4432,4433,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.134,PLANTAGENET,"And therefore haste I to the parliament,"
4433,4434,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.135,PLANTAGENET,"Either to be restored to my blood,"
4434,4435,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,2.5.136,PLANTAGENET,Or make my ill the advantage of my good.

4440,4441,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.1.2,OF WINCHESTER,"Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,"
4441,4442,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.1.3,OF WINCHESTER,"With written pamphlets studiously devised,"
4442,4443,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.1.4,OF WINCHESTER,"Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,"
4443,4444,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.1.5,OF WINCHESTER,"Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,"
4444,4445,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.1.6,OF WINCHESTER,"Do it without invention, suddenly,"
4445,4446,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.1.7,OF WINCHESTER,As I with sudden and extemporal speech
4446,4447,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.1.8,OF WINCHESTER,Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
4447,4448,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.9,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,"
4448,4449,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.10,GLOUCESTER,Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.
4449,4450,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.11,GLOUCESTER,"Think not, although in writing I preferr'd"
4450,4451,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.12,GLOUCESTER,"The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,"
4451,4452,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.13,GLOUCESTER,"That therefore I have forged, or am not able"
4452,4453,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.14,GLOUCESTER,Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
4453,4454,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.15,GLOUCESTER,"No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness,"
4454,4455,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.16,GLOUCESTER,"Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,"
4455,4456,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.17,GLOUCESTER,As very infants prattle of thy pride.
4456,4457,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.18,GLOUCESTER,"Thou art a most pernicious usurer,"
4457,4458,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.19,GLOUCESTER,"Forward by nature, enemy to peace,"
4458,4459,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.20,GLOUCESTER,"Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems"
4459,4460,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.21,GLOUCESTER,"A man of thy profession and degree,"
4460,4461,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.22,GLOUCESTER,"And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?"
4461,4462,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.23,GLOUCESTER,"In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,"
4462,4463,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.24,GLOUCESTER,As well at London bridge as at the Tower.
4463,4464,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.25,GLOUCESTER,"Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,"
4464,4465,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.26,GLOUCESTER,"The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt"
4465,4466,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.1.27,GLOUCESTER,From envious malice of thy swelling heart.

4467,4468,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.29,OF WINCHESTER,"Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe"
4468,4469,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.30,OF WINCHESTER,To give me hearing what I shall reply.
4469,4470,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.31,OF WINCHESTER,"If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,"
4470,4471,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.32,OF WINCHESTER,"As he will have me, how am I so poor?"
4471,4472,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.33,OF WINCHESTER,Or how haps it I seek not to advance
4472,4473,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.34,OF WINCHESTER,"Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?"
4473,4474,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.35,OF WINCHESTER,"And for dissension, who preferreth peace"
4474,4475,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.36,OF WINCHESTER,More than I do?--except I be provoked.
4475,4476,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.37,OF WINCHESTER,"No, my good lords, it is not that offends,"
4476,4477,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.38,OF WINCHESTER,It is not that that hath incensed the duke:
4477,4478,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.39,OF WINCHESTER,"It is, because no one should sway but he,"
4478,4479,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.40,OF WINCHESTER,"No one but he should be about the king,"
4479,4480,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.41,OF WINCHESTER,And that engenders thunder in his breast
4480,4481,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.42,OF WINCHESTER,And makes him roar these accusations forth.
4481,4482,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.1.43,OF WINCHESTER,But he shall know I am as good--
4482,4483,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,3.1.44,GLOUCESTER,As good!
4483,4484,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,3.1.45,GLOUCESTER,Thou bastard of my grandfather!

4485,4486,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,3.1.47,OF WINCHESTER,"Ay, lordly sir, for what are you, I pray,"
4486,4487,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,3.1.48,OF WINCHESTER,But one imperious in another's throne?
4487,4488,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,3.1.49,GLOUCESTER,"Am I not protector, saucy priest?"
4488,4489,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,3.1.50,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4489,4490,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,3.1.51,OF WINCHESTER,And am not I a prelate of the church?
4490,4491,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.1.52,GLOUCESTER,"Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps"
4491,4492,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.1.53,GLOUCESTER,And useth it to patronage his theft.
4492,4493,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.1.54,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4493,4494,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,3.1.55,OF WINCHESTER,Unreverent Gloster!
4494,4495,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,3.1.56,GLOUCESTER,Thou art reverent
4495,4496,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,3.1.57,GLOUCESTER,"Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life."
4496,4497,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,3.1.58,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4497,4498,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,3.1.59,OF WINCHESTER,Rome shall remedy this.
4498,4499,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,3.1.60,WARWICK,"Roam thither, then."
4499,4500,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,3.1.61,SOMERSET,"My lord, it were your duty to forbear."
4500,4501,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.1.62,WARWICK,"Ay, see the bishop be not overborne."
4501,4502,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,3.1.63,SOMERSET,Methinks my lord should be religious
4502,4503,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,3.1.64,SOMERSET,And know the office that belongs to such.
4503,4504,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.1.65,WARWICK,"Methinks his lordship should be humbler,"
4504,4505,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.1.66,WARWICK,it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
4505,4506,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,3.1.67,SOMERSET,"Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near."
4506,4507,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.1.68,WARWICK,"State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?"
4507,4508,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.1.69,WARWICK,Is not his grace protector to the king?
4508,4509,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.1.70,WARWICK,RICHARD
4509,4510,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.1.71,PLANTAGENET,"[Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,"
4510,4511,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.1.72,PLANTAGENET,"Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should,"
4511,4512,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.1.73,PLANTAGENET,Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'
4512,4513,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.1.74,PLANTAGENET,Else would I have a fling at Winchester.
4513,4514,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.75,KING HENRY VI,"Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,"
4514,4515,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.76,KING HENRY VI,"The special watchmen of our English weal,"
4515,4516,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.77,KING HENRY VI,"I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,"
4516,4517,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.78,KING HENRY VI,To join your hearts in love and amity.
4517,4518,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.79,KING HENRY VI,"O, what a scandal is it to our crown,"
4518,4519,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.80,KING HENRY VI,That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
4519,4520,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.81,KING HENRY VI,"Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell"
4520,4521,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.82,KING HENRY VI,Civil dissension is a viperous worm
4521,4522,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.83,KING HENRY VI,That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
4522,4523,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.83,KING HENRY VI,"A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!'"
4523,4524,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.1.84,KING HENRY VI,What tumult's this?
4524,4525,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,3.1.85,WARWICK,"An uproar, I dare warrant,"
4525,4526,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,3.1.86,WARWICK,Begun through malice of the bishop's men.
4526,4527,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,3.1.86,WARWICK,"A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor"
4527,4528,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.87,Mayor,"O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,"
4528,4529,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.88,Mayor,"Pity the city of London, pity us!"
4529,4530,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.89,Mayor,"The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,"
4530,4531,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.90,Mayor,"Forbidden late to carry any weapon,"
4531,4532,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.91,Mayor,Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
4532,4533,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.92,Mayor,And banding themselves in contrary parts
4533,4534,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.93,Mayor,Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
4534,4535,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.94,Mayor,That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:
4535,4536,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.95,Mayor,Our windows are broke down in every street
4536,4537,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.1.96,Mayor,And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
4537,4538,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,,Mayor,"Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates"
4538,4539,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.1.97,KING HENRY VI,"We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,"
4539,4540,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.1.98,KING HENRY VI,To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.
4540,4541,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.1.99,KING HENRY VI,"Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife."
4541,4542,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.1.100,KING HENRY VI,"First Serving-man	Nay, if we be forbidden stones,"
4542,4543,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.1.101,KING HENRY VI,We'll fall to it with our teeth.
4543,4544,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.1.102,KING HENRY VI,"Second Serving-man	Do what ye dare, we are as resolute."
4544,4545,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,,KING HENRY VI,Skirmish again
4545,4546,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.103,GLOUCESTER,"You of my household, leave this peevish broil"
4546,4547,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.104,GLOUCESTER,And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
4547,4548,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.105,GLOUCESTER,"Third Serving-man	My lord, we know your grace to be a man"
4548,4549,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.106,GLOUCESTER,"Just and upright, and, for your royal birth,"
4549,4550,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.107,GLOUCESTER,Inferior to none but to his majesty:
4550,4551,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.108,GLOUCESTER,"And ere that we will suffer such a prince,"
4551,4552,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.109,GLOUCESTER,"So kind a father of the commonweal,"
4552,4553,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.110,GLOUCESTER,"To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,"
4553,4554,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.111,GLOUCESTER,We and our wives and children all will fight
4554,4555,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.112,GLOUCESTER,And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
4555,4556,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.113,GLOUCESTER,"First Serving-man	Ay, and the very parings of our nails"
4556,4557,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.1.114,GLOUCESTER,Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
4557,4558,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,,GLOUCESTER,Begin again
4558,4559,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,3.1.115,GLOUCESTER,"Stay, stay, I say!"
4559,4560,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,3.1.116,GLOUCESTER,"And if you love me, as you say you do,"
4560,4561,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,3.1.117,GLOUCESTER,Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
4561,4562,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.1.118,KING HENRY VI,"O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!"
4562,4563,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.1.119,KING HENRY VI,"Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold"
4563,4564,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.1.120,KING HENRY VI,My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
4564,4565,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.1.121,KING HENRY VI,"Who should be pitiful, if you be not?"
4565,4566,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.1.122,KING HENRY VI,Or who should study to prefer a peace.
4566,4567,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.1.123,KING HENRY VI,If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
4567,4568,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.1.124,WARWICK,"Yield, my lord protector, yield, Winchester,"
4568,4569,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.1.125,WARWICK,Except you mean with obstinate repulse
4569,4570,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.1.126,WARWICK,To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
4570,4571,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.1.127,WARWICK,You see what mischief and what murder too
4571,4572,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.1.128,WARWICK,"Hath been enacted through your enmity,"
4572,4573,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.1.129,WARWICK,Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.
4573,4574,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.1.130,WARWICK,BISHOP
4574,4575,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.1.131,OF WINCHESTER,"He shall submit, or I will never yield."
4575,4576,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,3.1.132,GLOUCESTER,"Compassion on the king commands me stoop,"
4576,4577,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,3.1.133,GLOUCESTER,"Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest"
4577,4578,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,3.1.134,GLOUCESTER,Should ever get that privilege of me.
4578,4579,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.1.135,WARWICK,"Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke"
4579,4580,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.1.136,WARWICK,"Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,"
4580,4581,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.1.137,WARWICK,As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:
4581,4582,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.1.138,WARWICK,Why look you still so stern and tragical?
4582,4583,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,3.1.139,GLOUCESTER,"Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand."
4583,4584,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,3.1.140,KING HENRY VI,"Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach"
4584,4585,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,3.1.141,KING HENRY VI,"That malice was a great and grievous sin,"
4585,4586,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,3.1.142,KING HENRY VI,"And will not you maintain the thing you teach,"
4586,4587,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,3.1.143,KING HENRY VI,But prove a chief offender in the same?
4587,4588,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.1.144,WARWICK,Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
4588,4589,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.1.145,WARWICK,"For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!"
4589,4590,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.1.146,WARWICK,"What, shall a child instruct you what to do?"
4590,4591,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.1.147,WARWICK,BISHOP
4591,4592,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,3.1.148,OF WINCHESTER,"Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee,"
4592,4593,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,3.1.149,OF WINCHESTER,Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.

4594,4595,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,3.1.151,GLOUCESTER,"See here, my friends and loving countrymen,"
4595,4596,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,3.1.152,GLOUCESTER,This token serveth for a flag of truce
4596,4597,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,3.1.153,GLOUCESTER,Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:
4597,4598,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,3.1.154,GLOUCESTER,"So help me God, as I dissemble not!"
4598,4599,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,3.1.155,GLOUCESTER,BISHOP
4599,4600,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,3.1.156,OF WINCHESTER,"[Aside]  So help me God, as I intend it not!"
4600,4601,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.157,KING HENRY VI,"O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,"
4601,4602,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.158,KING HENRY VI,How joyful am I made by this contract!
4602,4603,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.159,KING HENRY VI,"Away, my masters! trouble us no more,"
4603,4604,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.160,KING HENRY VI,"But join in friendship, as your lords have done."
4604,4605,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.161,KING HENRY VI,First Serving-man	Content: I'll to the surgeon's.
4605,4606,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.162,KING HENRY VI,Second Serving-man	And so will I.
4606,4607,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.163,KING HENRY VI,Third Serving-man	And I will see what physic the tavern affords.
4607,4608,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.1.163,KING HENRY VI,"Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor,  and c"
4608,4609,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,3.1.164,WARWICK,"Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,"
4609,4610,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,3.1.165,WARWICK,Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
4610,4611,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,3.1.166,WARWICK,We do exhibit to your majesty.
4611,4612,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,3.1.167,GLOUCESTER,"Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,"
4612,4613,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,3.1.168,GLOUCESTER,"And if your grace mark every circumstance,"
4613,4614,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,3.1.169,GLOUCESTER,"You have great reason to do Richard right,"
4614,4615,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,3.1.170,GLOUCESTER,Especially for those occasions
4615,4616,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,3.1.171,GLOUCESTER,At Eltham Place I told your majesty.
4616,4617,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.1.172,KING HENRY VI,"And those occasions, uncle, were of force:"
4617,4618,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.1.173,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is"
4618,4619,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.1.174,KING HENRY VI,That Richard be restored to his blood.
4619,4620,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,3.1.175,WARWICK,"Let Richard be restored to his blood,"
4620,4621,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,3.1.176,WARWICK,So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.

4622,4623,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,3.1.178,OF WINCHESTER,"As will the rest, so willeth Winchester."
4623,4624,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.1.179,KING HENRY VI,"If Richard will be true, not that alone"
4624,4625,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.1.180,KING HENRY VI,But all the whole inheritance I give
4625,4626,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.1.181,KING HENRY VI,"That doth belong unto the house of York,"
4626,4627,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.1.182,KING HENRY VI,From whence you spring by lineal descent.

4628,4629,Henry VI Part 1,44.0,3.1.184,PLANTAGENET,Thy humble servant vows obedience
4629,4630,Henry VI Part 1,44.0,3.1.185,PLANTAGENET,And humble service till the point of death.

4631,4632,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.1.187,KING HENRY VI,"And, in reguerdon of that duty done,"
4632,4633,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.1.188,KING HENRY VI,I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:
4633,4634,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.1.189,KING HENRY VI,"Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,"
4634,4635,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.1.190,KING HENRY VI,And rise created princely Duke of York.

4636,4637,Henry VI Part 1,46.0,3.1.192,PLANTAGENET,And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
4637,4638,Henry VI Part 1,46.0,3.1.193,PLANTAGENET,"And as my duty springs, so perish they"
4638,4639,Henry VI Part 1,46.0,3.1.194,PLANTAGENET,That grudge one thought against your majesty!
4639,4640,Henry VI Part 1,47.0,3.1.195,ALL,"Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!"
4640,4641,Henry VI Part 1,48.0,3.1.196,SOMERSET,"[Aside]  Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!"
4641,4642,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,3.1.197,GLOUCESTER,Now will it best avail your majesty
4642,4643,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,3.1.198,GLOUCESTER,To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:
4643,4644,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,3.1.199,GLOUCESTER,The presence of a king engenders love
4644,4645,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,3.1.200,GLOUCESTER,"Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,"
4645,4646,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,3.1.201,GLOUCESTER,As it disanimates his enemies.
4646,4647,Henry VI Part 1,50.0,3.1.202,KING HENRY VI,"When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes,"
4647,4648,Henry VI Part 1,50.0,3.1.203,KING HENRY VI,For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
4648,4649,Henry VI Part 1,51.0,3.1.204,GLOUCESTER,Your ships already are in readiness.
4649,4650,Henry VI Part 1,51.0,,GLOUCESTER,Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER
4650,4651,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.205,EXETER,"Ay, we may march in England or in France,"
4651,4652,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.206,EXETER,Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
4652,4653,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.207,EXETER,This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
4653,4654,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.208,EXETER,Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
4654,4655,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.209,EXETER,And will at last break out into a flame:
4655,4656,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.210,EXETER,"As fester'd members rot but by degree,"
4656,4657,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.211,EXETER,"Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,"
4657,4658,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.212,EXETER,So will this base and envious discord breed.
4658,4659,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.213,EXETER,And now I fear that fatal prophecy
4659,4660,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.214,EXETER,Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
4660,4661,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.215,EXETER,"Was in the mouth of every sucking babe,"
4661,4662,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.216,EXETER,That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
4662,4663,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.217,EXETER,And Henry born at Windsor lose all:

4664,4665,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,3.1.219,EXETER,His days may finish ere that hapless time.

4667,4668,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,,EXETER,"Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks upon their backs"
4668,4669,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.1,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,"
4669,4670,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.2,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Through which our policy must make a breach:
4670,4671,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.3,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Take heed, be wary how you place your words,"
4671,4672,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.4,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
4672,4673,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.5,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That come to gather money for their corn.
4673,4674,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.6,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,"
4674,4675,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.7,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And that we find the slothful watch but weak,"
4675,4676,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.8,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,"
4676,4677,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.2.9,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
4677,4678,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.2.10,First Soldier,"Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,"
4678,4679,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.2.11,First Soldier,"And we be lords and rulers over Rouen,"
4679,4680,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.2.12,First Soldier,Therefore we'll knock.
4680,4681,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,,First Soldier,Knocks
4681,4682,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.2.13,Watch,[Within]  Qui est la?
4682,4683,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,3.2.14,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Paysans, pauvres gens de France,"
4683,4684,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,3.2.15,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.
4684,4685,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,3.2.16,Watch,"Enter, go in, the market bell is rung."
4685,4686,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,3.2.17,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground."
4686,4687,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Exeunt
4687,4688,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, REIGNIER, and forces"
4688,4689,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,3.2.18,CHARLES,Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
4689,4690,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,3.2.19,CHARLES,And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
4690,4691,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.2.20,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants,"
4691,4692,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.2.21,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Now she is there, how will she specify"
4692,4693,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.2.22,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,Where is the best and safest passage in?
4693,4694,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,3.2.23,REIGNIER,"By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower,"
4694,4695,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,3.2.24,REIGNIER,"Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,"
4695,4696,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,3.2.25,REIGNIER,"No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd."
4696,4697,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,,REIGNIER,"Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a torch burning"
4697,4698,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,3.2.26,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Behold, this is the happy wedding torch"
4698,4699,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,3.2.27,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,"
4699,4700,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,3.2.28,JOAN LA PUCELLE,But burning fatal to the Talbotites!
4700,4701,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Exit
4701,4702,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,3.2.29,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend,"
4702,4703,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,3.2.30,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
4703,4704,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,3.2.31,CHARLES,"Now shine it like a comet of revenge,"
4704,4705,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,3.2.32,CHARLES,A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
4705,4706,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,3.2.33,REIGNIER,"Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends,"
4706,4707,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,3.2.34,REIGNIER,"Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,"
4707,4708,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,3.2.35,REIGNIER,And then do execution on the watch.
4708,4709,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,,REIGNIER,Alarum. Exeunt
4709,4710,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,,REIGNIER,An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion
4710,4711,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.2.36,TALBOT,"France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,"
4711,4712,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.2.37,TALBOT,If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
4712,4713,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.2.38,TALBOT,"Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,"
4713,4714,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.2.39,TALBOT,"Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,"
4714,4715,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.2.40,TALBOT,That hardly we escaped the pride of France.
4715,4716,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,,TALBOT,Exit
4716,4717,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,,TALBOT,"An alarum: excursions. BEDFORD, brought in sick  in a chair. Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without:  within JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, on the walls"
4717,4718,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,3.2.41,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?"
4718,4719,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,3.2.42,JOAN LA PUCELLE,I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
4719,4720,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,3.2.43,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Before he'll buy again at such a rate:
4720,4721,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,3.2.44,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"'Twas full of darnel, do you like the taste?"
4721,4722,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.2.45,BURGUNDY,"Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!"
4722,4723,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.2.46,BURGUNDY,I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
4723,4724,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.2.47,BURGUNDY,And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
4724,4725,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,3.2.48,CHARLES,Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.
4725,4726,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.2.49,BEDFORD,"O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!"
4726,4727,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.2.50,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,"
4727,4728,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.2.51,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And run a tilt at death within a chair?
4728,4729,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.2.52,TALBOT,"Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,"
4729,4730,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.2.53,TALBOT,Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!
4730,4731,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.2.54,TALBOT,Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
4731,4732,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.2.55,TALBOT,And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
4732,4733,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.2.56,TALBOT,"Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,"
4733,4734,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.2.57,TALBOT,Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
4734,4735,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,3.2.58,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace,"
4735,4736,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,3.2.59,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow."
4736,4737,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,The English whisper together in council
4737,4738,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,3.2.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
4738,4739,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.2.61,TALBOT,Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
4739,4740,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.2.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,"
4740,4741,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.2.63,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To try if that our own be ours or no.
4741,4742,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.2.64,TALBOT,"I speak not to that railing Hecate,"
4742,4743,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.2.65,TALBOT,"But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest,"
4743,4744,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.2.66,TALBOT,"Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?"
4744,4745,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,3.2.67,ALENCON,"Signior, no."
4745,4746,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.2.68,TALBOT,"Signior, hang! base muleters of France!"
4746,4747,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.2.69,TALBOT,Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
4747,4748,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,3.2.70,TALBOT,And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
4748,4749,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.2.71,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Away, captains! let's get us from the walls,"
4749,4750,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.2.72,JOAN LA PUCELLE,For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
4750,4751,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.2.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you"
4751,4752,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,3.2.74,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That we are here.
4752,4753,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Exeunt from the walls
4753,4754,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.75,TALBOT,"And there will we be too, ere it be long,"
4754,4755,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.76,TALBOT,Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
4755,4756,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.77,TALBOT,"Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,"
4756,4757,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.78,TALBOT,"Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,"
4757,4758,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.79,TALBOT,Either to get the town again or die:
4758,4759,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.80,TALBOT,"And I, as sure as English Henry lives"
4759,4760,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.81,TALBOT,"And as his father here was conqueror,"
4760,4761,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.82,TALBOT,As sure as in this late-betrayed town
4761,4762,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.83,TALBOT,"Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,"
4762,4763,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,3.2.84,TALBOT,So sure I swear to get the town or die.
4763,4764,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,3.2.85,BURGUNDY,My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
4764,4765,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.2.86,TALBOT,"But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,"
4765,4766,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.2.87,TALBOT,"The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,"
4766,4767,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.2.88,TALBOT,"We will bestow you in some better place,"
4767,4768,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,3.2.89,TALBOT,Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
4768,4769,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,3.2.90,BEDFORD,"Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:"
4769,4770,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,3.2.91,BEDFORD,Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
4770,4771,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,3.2.92,BEDFORD,And will be partner of your weal or woe.
4771,4772,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,3.2.93,BURGUNDY,"Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you."
4772,4773,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.2.94,BEDFORD,"Not to be gone from hence, for once I read"
4773,4774,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.2.95,BEDFORD,That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
4774,4775,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.2.96,BEDFORD,Came to the field and vanquished his foes:
4775,4776,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.2.97,BEDFORD,"Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,"
4776,4777,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,3.2.98,BEDFORD,Because I ever found them as myself.
4777,4778,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,3.2.99,TALBOT,Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
4778,4779,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,3.2.100,TALBOT,Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
4779,4780,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,3.2.101,TALBOT,"And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,"
4780,4781,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,3.2.102,TALBOT,But gather we our forces out of hand
4781,4782,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,3.2.103,TALBOT,And set upon our boasting enemy.
4782,4783,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,,TALBOT,Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants
4783,4784,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,,TALBOT,An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain
4784,4785,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,3.2.104,Captain,"Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?"
4785,4786,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,3.2.105,FASTOLFE,Whither away! to save myself by flight:
4786,4787,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,3.2.106,FASTOLFE,We are like to have the overthrow again.
4787,4788,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,3.2.107,Captain,"What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?"
4788,4789,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,3.2.108,FASTOLFE,"Ay,"
4789,4790,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,3.2.109,FASTOLFE,"All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!"
4790,4791,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,,FASTOLFE,Exit
4791,4792,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,3.2.110,Captain,Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!
4792,4793,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,,Captain,Exit
4793,4794,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,,Captain,"Retreat: excursions. JOAN LA PUCELLE, ALENCON, and CHARLES fly"
4794,4795,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.2.111,BEDFORD,"Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,"
4795,4796,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.2.112,BEDFORD,For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
4796,4797,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.2.113,BEDFORD,What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
4797,4798,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.2.114,BEDFORD,They that of late were daring with their scoffs
4798,4799,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,3.2.115,BEDFORD,Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
4799,4800,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,,BEDFORD,"BEDFORD dies, and is carried in by two in his chair"
4800,4801,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,,BEDFORD,"An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest"
4801,4802,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,3.2.116,TALBOT,"Lost, and recover'd in a day again!"
4802,4803,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,3.2.117,TALBOT,"This is a double honour, Burgundy:"
4803,4804,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,3.2.118,TALBOT,Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
4804,4805,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,3.2.119,BURGUNDY,"Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy"
4805,4806,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,3.2.120,BURGUNDY,Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
4806,4807,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,3.2.121,BURGUNDY,Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.
4807,4808,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.122,TALBOT,"Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?"
4808,4809,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.123,TALBOT,I think her old familiar is asleep:
4809,4810,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.124,TALBOT,"Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?"
4810,4811,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.125,TALBOT,"What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief"
4811,4812,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.126,TALBOT,That such a valiant company are fled.
4812,4813,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.127,TALBOT,"Now will we take some order in the town,"
4813,4814,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.128,TALBOT,"Placing therein some expert officers,"
4814,4815,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.129,TALBOT,"And then depart to Paris to the king,"
4815,4816,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,3.2.130,TALBOT,For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
4816,4817,Henry VI Part 1,44.0,3.2.131,BURGUNDY,What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
4817,4818,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.2.132,TALBOT,"But yet, before we go, let's not forget"
4818,4819,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.2.133,TALBOT,"The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,"
4819,4820,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.2.134,TALBOT,But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:
4820,4821,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.2.135,TALBOT,"A braver soldier never couched lance,"
4821,4822,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.2.136,TALBOT,"A gentler heart did never sway in court,"
4822,4823,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.2.137,TALBOT,"But kings and mightiest potentates must die,"
4823,4824,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,3.2.138,TALBOT,For that's the end of human misery.
4824,4825,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,,TALBOT,Exeunt
4825,4826,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,,TALBOT,SCENE III. The plains near Rouen.
4826,4827,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,,TALBOT,"Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces"
4827,4828,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.1,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Dismay not, princes, at this accident,"
4828,4829,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.2,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:
4829,4830,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.3,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,"
4830,4831,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.4,JOAN LA PUCELLE,For things that are not to be remedied.
4831,4832,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.5,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
4832,4833,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.6,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And like a peacock sweep along his tail,"
4833,4834,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.7,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,"
4834,4835,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,3.3.8,JOAN LA PUCELLE,If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.
4835,4836,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.3.9,CHARLES,"We have been guided by thee hitherto,"
4836,4837,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.3.10,CHARLES,And of thy cunning had no diffidence:
4837,4838,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,3.3.11,CHARLES,One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
4838,4839,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.3.12,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,"Search out thy wit for secret policies,"
4839,4840,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,3.3.13,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,And we will make thee famous through the world.
4840,4841,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,3.3.14,ALENCON,"We'll set thy statue in some holy place,"
4841,4842,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,3.3.15,ALENCON,And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:
4842,4843,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,3.3.16,ALENCON,"Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good."
4843,4844,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,3.3.17,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then thus it must be, this doth Joan devise:"
4844,4845,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,3.3.18,JOAN LA PUCELLE,By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
4845,4846,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,3.3.19,JOAN LA PUCELLE,We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
4846,4847,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,3.3.20,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To leave the Talbot and to follow us.
4847,4848,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,3.3.21,CHARLES,"Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,"
4848,4849,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,3.3.22,CHARLES,"France were no place for Henry's warriors,"
4849,4850,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,3.3.23,CHARLES,"Nor should that nation boast it so with us,"
4850,4851,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,3.3.24,CHARLES,But be extirped from our provinces.
4851,4852,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,3.3.25,ALENCON,For ever should they be expulsed from France
4852,4853,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,3.3.26,ALENCON,And not have title of an earldom here.
4853,4854,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.27,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Your honours shall perceive how I will work
4854,4855,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.28,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To bring this matter to the wished end.
4855,4856,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Drum sounds afar off
4856,4857,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.29,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
4857,4858,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.30,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
4858,4859,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over at a distance, TALBOT and his forces"
4859,4860,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.31,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,"
4860,4861,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.32,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And all the troops of English after him.
4861,4862,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces
4862,4863,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.33,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
4863,4864,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.34,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
4864,4865,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,3.3.35,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Summon a parley, we will talk with him."
4865,4866,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Trumpets sound a parley
4866,4867,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,3.3.36,CHARLES,A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
4867,4868,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,3.3.37,BURGUNDY,Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
4868,4869,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,3.3.38,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"The princely Charles of France, thy countryman."
4869,4870,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,3.3.39,BURGUNDY,"What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence."
4870,4871,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,3.3.40,CHARLES,"Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words."
4871,4872,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.3.41,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!"
4872,4873,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,3.3.42,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee."
4873,4874,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,3.3.43,BURGUNDY,"Speak on, but be not over-tedious."
4874,4875,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.44,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Look on thy country, look on fertile France,"
4875,4876,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.45,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And see the cities and the towns defaced
4876,4877,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.46,JOAN LA PUCELLE,By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
4877,4878,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.47,JOAN LA PUCELLE,As looks the mother on her lowly babe
4878,4879,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.48,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"When death doth close his tender dying eyes,"
4879,4880,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.49,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"See, see the pining malady of France,"
4880,4881,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.50,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,"
4881,4882,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.51,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.
4882,4883,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.52,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O, turn thy edged sword another way,"
4883,4884,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.53,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help."
4884,4885,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.54,JOAN LA PUCELLE,One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
4885,4886,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.55,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
4886,4887,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.56,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,"
4887,4888,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,3.3.57,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And wash away thy country's stained spots.
4888,4889,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,3.3.58,BURGUNDY,"Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,"
4889,4890,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,3.3.59,BURGUNDY,Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
4890,4891,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,"
4891,4892,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.61,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
4892,4893,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
4893,4894,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.63,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
4894,4895,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.64,JOAN LA PUCELLE,When Talbot hath set footing once in France
4895,4896,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.65,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,"
4896,4897,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.66,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Who then but English Henry will be lord
4897,4898,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.67,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
4898,4899,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.68,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,"
4899,4900,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.69,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?
4900,4901,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.70,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And was he not in England prisoner?
4901,4902,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.71,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But when they heard he was thine enemy,"
4902,4903,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.72,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"They set him free without his ransom paid,"
4903,4904,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
4904,4905,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.74,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen"
4905,4906,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.75,JOAN LA PUCELLE,And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
4906,4907,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Come, come, return, return, thou wandering lord:"
4907,4908,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,3.3.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
4908,4909,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.3.78,BURGUNDY,"I am vanquished, these haughty words of hers"
4909,4910,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.3.79,BURGUNDY,"Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,"
4910,4911,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.3.80,BURGUNDY,And made me almost yield upon my knees.
4911,4912,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.3.81,BURGUNDY,"Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,"
4912,4913,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.3.82,BURGUNDY,"And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:"
4913,4914,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.3.83,BURGUNDY,My forces and my power of men are yours:
4914,4915,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,3.3.84,BURGUNDY,"So farewell, Talbot, I'll no longer trust thee."
4915,4916,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,3.3.85,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!"
4916,4917,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,3.3.86,CHARLES,"Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh."
4917,4918,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,3.3.87,BASTARD OF ORLEANS,And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
4918,4919,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.3.88,ALENCON,"Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,"
4919,4920,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,3.3.89,ALENCON,And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
4920,4921,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.3.90,CHARLES,"Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,"
4921,4922,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,3.3.91,CHARLES,And seek how we may prejudice the foe.

5002,5003,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,4.1.24,TALBOT,Like to a trusty squire did run away:

5028,5029,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,4.1.49,KING HENRY VI,"And now, my lord protector, view the letter"
5029,5030,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,4.1.50,KING HENRY VI,Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
5030,5031,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.51,GLOUCESTER,"What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?"
5031,5032,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.52,GLOUCESTER,"No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'"
5032,5033,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.53,GLOUCESTER,Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
5033,5034,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.54,GLOUCESTER,Or doth this churlish superscription
5034,5035,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.55,GLOUCESTER,Pretend some alteration in good will?
5035,5036,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.56,GLOUCESTER,What's here?
5036,5037,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,,GLOUCESTER,Reads
5037,5038,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.57,GLOUCESTER,"'I have, upon especial cause,"
5038,5039,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.58,GLOUCESTER,"Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,"
5039,5040,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.59,GLOUCESTER,Together with the pitiful complaints
5040,5041,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.60,GLOUCESTER,"Of such as your oppression feeds upon,"
5041,5042,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.61,GLOUCESTER,Forsaken your pernicious faction
5042,5043,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.62,GLOUCESTER,"And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'"
5043,5044,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.63,GLOUCESTER,"O monstrous treachery! can this be so,"
5044,5045,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.64,GLOUCESTER,"That in alliance, amity and oaths,"
5045,5046,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.1.65,GLOUCESTER,There should be found such false dissembling guile?
5046,5047,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,4.1.66,KING HENRY VI,What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
5047,5048,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,4.1.67,GLOUCESTER,"He doth, my lord, and is become your foe."
5048,5049,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,4.1.68,KING HENRY VI,Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
5049,5050,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,4.1.69,GLOUCESTER,"It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes."
5050,5051,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,4.1.70,KING HENRY VI,"Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him"
5051,5052,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,4.1.71,KING HENRY VI,And give him chastisement for this abuse.
5052,5053,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,4.1.72,KING HENRY VI,"How say you, my lord? are you not content?"
5053,5054,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,4.1.73,TALBOT,"Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,"
5054,5055,Henry VI Part 1,15.0,4.1.74,TALBOT,I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.
5055,5056,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,4.1.75,KING HENRY VI,Then gather strength and march unto him straight:
5056,5057,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,4.1.76,KING HENRY VI,Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
5057,5058,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,4.1.77,KING HENRY VI,And what offence it is to flout his friends.
5058,5059,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,4.1.78,TALBOT,"I go, my lord, in heart desiring still"
5059,5060,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,4.1.79,TALBOT,You may behold confusion of your foes.
5060,5061,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,,TALBOT,Exit
5061,5062,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,,TALBOT,Enter VERNON and BASSET
5062,5063,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,4.1.80,VERNON,"Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign."
5063,5064,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,4.1.81,BASSET,"And me, my lord, grant me the combat too."
5064,5065,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,4.1.82,YORK,"This is my servant: hear him, noble prince."
5065,5066,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,4.1.83,SOMERSET,"And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him."
5066,5067,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,4.1.84,KING HENRY VI,"Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak."
5067,5068,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,4.1.85,KING HENRY VI,"Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?"
5068,5069,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,4.1.86,KING HENRY VI,And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?
5069,5070,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,4.1.87,VERNON,"With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong."
5070,5071,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,4.1.88,BASSET,"And I with him, for he hath done me wrong."
5071,5072,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,4.1.89,KING HENRY VI,What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
5072,5073,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,4.1.90,KING HENRY VI,"First let me know, and then I'll answer you."
5073,5074,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.91,BASSET,"Crossing the sea from England into France,"
5074,5075,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.92,BASSET,"This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,"
5075,5076,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.93,BASSET,"Upbraided me about the rose I wear,"
5076,5077,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.94,BASSET,"Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves"
5077,5078,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.95,BASSET,"Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,"
5078,5079,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.96,BASSET,When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
5079,5080,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.97,BASSET,About a certain question in the law
5080,5081,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.98,BASSET,"Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him,"
5081,5082,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.99,BASSET,With other vile and ignominious terms:
5082,5083,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.100,BASSET,In confutation of which rude reproach
5083,5084,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.101,BASSET,"And in defence of my lord's worthiness,"
5084,5085,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,4.1.102,BASSET,I crave the benefit of law of arms.
5085,5086,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,4.1.103,VERNON,"And that is my petition, noble lord:"
5086,5087,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,4.1.104,VERNON,For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
5087,5088,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,4.1.105,VERNON,"To set a gloss upon his bold intent,"
5088,5089,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,4.1.106,VERNON,"Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him,"
5089,5090,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,4.1.107,VERNON,"And he first took exceptions at this badge,"
5090,5091,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,4.1.108,VERNON,Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
5091,5092,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,4.1.109,VERNON,Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
5092,5093,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,4.1.110,YORK,"Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?"
5093,5094,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,4.1.111,SOMERSET,"Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,"
5094,5095,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,4.1.112,SOMERSET,Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.
5095,5096,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,4.1.113,KING HENRY VI,"Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,"
5096,5097,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,4.1.114,KING HENRY VI,When for so slight and frivolous a cause
5097,5098,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,4.1.115,KING HENRY VI,Such factious emulations shall arise!
5098,5099,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,4.1.116,KING HENRY VI,"Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,"
5099,5100,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,4.1.117,KING HENRY VI,"Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace."
5100,5101,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,4.1.118,YORK,"Let this dissension first be tried by fight,"
5101,5102,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,4.1.119,YORK,And then your highness shall command a peace.
5102,5103,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,4.1.120,SOMERSET,"The quarrel toucheth none but us alone,"
5103,5104,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,4.1.121,SOMERSET,Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
5104,5105,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,4.1.122,YORK,"There is my pledge, accept it, Somerset."
5105,5106,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,4.1.123,VERNON,"Nay, let it rest where it began at first."
5106,5107,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,4.1.124,BASSET,"Confirm it so, mine honourable lord."
5107,5108,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.125,GLOUCESTER,Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
5108,5109,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.126,GLOUCESTER,"And perish ye, with your audacious prate!"
5109,5110,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.127,GLOUCESTER,"Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed"
5110,5111,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.128,GLOUCESTER,With this immodest clamorous outrage
5111,5112,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.129,GLOUCESTER,To trouble and disturb the king and us?
5112,5113,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.130,GLOUCESTER,"And you, my lords, methinks you do not well"
5113,5114,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.131,GLOUCESTER,"To bear with their perverse objections,"
5114,5115,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.132,GLOUCESTER,Much less to take occasion from their mouths
5115,5116,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.133,GLOUCESTER,To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
5116,5117,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,4.1.134,GLOUCESTER,Let me persuade you take a better course.
5117,5118,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,4.1.135,EXETER,"It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends."
5118,5119,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.136,KING HENRY VI,"Come hither, you that would be combatants:"
5119,5120,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.137,KING HENRY VI,"Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,"
5120,5121,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.138,KING HENRY VI,Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
5121,5122,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.139,KING HENRY VI,"And you, my lords, remember where we are,"
5122,5123,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.140,KING HENRY VI,"In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:"
5123,5124,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.141,KING HENRY VI,If they perceive dissension in our looks
5124,5125,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.142,KING HENRY VI,"And that within ourselves we disagree,"
5125,5126,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.143,KING HENRY VI,How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
5126,5127,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.144,KING HENRY VI,"To wilful disobedience, and rebel!"
5127,5128,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.145,KING HENRY VI,"Beside, what infamy will there arise,"
5128,5129,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.146,KING HENRY VI,When foreign princes shall be certified
5129,5130,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.147,KING HENRY VI,"That for a toy, a thing of no regard,"
5130,5131,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.148,KING HENRY VI,King Henry's peers and chief nobility
5131,5132,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.149,KING HENRY VI,"Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!"
5132,5133,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.150,KING HENRY VI,"O, think upon the conquest of my father,"
5133,5134,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.151,KING HENRY VI,"My tender years, and let us not forego"
5134,5135,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.152,KING HENRY VI,That for a trifle that was bought with blood
5135,5136,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.153,KING HENRY VI,Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
5136,5137,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.154,KING HENRY VI,"I see no reason, if I wear this rose,"
5137,5138,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,,KING HENRY VI,Putting on a red rose
5138,5139,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.155,KING HENRY VI,That any one should therefore be suspicious
5139,5140,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.156,KING HENRY VI,I more incline to Somerset than York:
5140,5141,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.157,KING HENRY VI,"Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:"
5141,5142,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.158,KING HENRY VI,"As well they may upbraid me with my crown,"
5142,5143,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.159,KING HENRY VI,"Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd."
5143,5144,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.160,KING HENRY VI,But your discretions better can persuade
5144,5145,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.161,KING HENRY VI,Than I am able to instruct or teach:
5145,5146,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.162,KING HENRY VI,"And therefore, as we hither came in peace,"
5146,5147,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.163,KING HENRY VI,So let us still continue peace and love.
5147,5148,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.164,KING HENRY VI,"Cousin of York, we institute your grace"
5148,5149,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.165,KING HENRY VI,To be our regent in these parts of France:
5149,5150,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.166,KING HENRY VI,"And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite"
5150,5151,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.167,KING HENRY VI,"Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot,"
5151,5152,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.168,KING HENRY VI,"And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,"
5152,5153,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.169,KING HENRY VI,Go cheerfully together and digest.
5153,5154,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.170,KING HENRY VI,Your angry choler on your enemies.
5154,5155,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.171,KING HENRY VI,"Ourself, my lord protector and the rest"
5155,5156,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.172,KING HENRY VI,"After some respite will return to Calais,"
5156,5157,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.173,KING HENRY VI,"From thence to England, where I hope ere long"
5157,5158,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.174,KING HENRY VI,"To be presented, by your victories,"
5158,5159,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,4.1.175,KING HENRY VI,"With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout."
5159,5160,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,,KING HENRY VI,"Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER and VERNON"
5160,5161,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,4.1.176,WARWICK,"My Lord of York, I promise you, the king"
5161,5162,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,4.1.177,WARWICK,"Prettily, methought, did play the orator."
5162,5163,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,4.1.178,YORK,"And so he did, but yet I like it not,"
5163,5164,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,4.1.179,YORK,In that he wears the badge of Somerset.
5164,5165,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,4.1.180,WARWICK,"Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not,"
5165,5166,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,4.1.181,WARWICK,"I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm."
5166,5167,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,4.1.182,YORK,"An if I wist he did,--but let it rest,"
5167,5168,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,4.1.183,YORK,Other affairs must now be managed.
5168,5169,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,,YORK,Exeunt all but EXETER
5169,5170,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.184,EXETER,"Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice,"
5170,5171,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.185,EXETER,"For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,"
5171,5172,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.186,EXETER,I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
5172,5173,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.187,EXETER,"More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,"
5173,5174,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.188,EXETER,Than yet can be imagined or supposed.
5174,5175,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.189,EXETER,"But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees"
5175,5176,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.190,EXETER,"This jarring discord of nobility,"
5176,5177,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.191,EXETER,"This shouldering of each other in the court,"
5177,5178,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.192,EXETER,"This factious bandying of their favourites,"
5178,5179,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.193,EXETER,But that it doth presage some ill event.
5179,5180,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.194,EXETER,"'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands,"
5180,5181,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.195,EXETER,"But more when envy breeds unkind division,"
5181,5182,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,4.1.196,EXETER,"There comes the rain, there begins confusion."
5182,5183,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,,EXETER,Exit
5183,5184,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,,EXETER,SCENE II. Before Bourdeaux.

5186,5187,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.2,TALBOT,Summon their general unto the wall.
5187,5188,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,,TALBOT,"Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft"
5188,5189,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.3,TALBOT,"English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,"
5189,5190,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.4,TALBOT,"Servant in arms to Harry King of England,"
5190,5191,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.5,TALBOT,"And thus he would: Open your city gates,"
5191,5192,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.6,TALBOT,"Be humble to us, call my sovereign yours,"
5192,5193,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.7,TALBOT,"And do him homage as obedient subjects,"
5193,5194,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.8,TALBOT,And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:
5194,5195,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.9,TALBOT,"But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,"
5195,5196,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.10,TALBOT,"You tempt the fury of my three attendants,"
5196,5197,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.11,TALBOT,"Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire,"
5197,5198,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.12,TALBOT,Who in a moment even with the earth
5198,5199,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.13,TALBOT,"Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,"
5199,5200,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.2.14,TALBOT,If you forsake the offer of their love.
5200,5201,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.2.15,General,"Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,"
5201,5202,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.2.16,General,Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
5202,5203,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.2.17,General,The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
5203,5204,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.2.18,General,"On us thou canst not enter but by death,"
5204,5205,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.2.19,General,"For, I protest, we are well fortified"
5205,5206,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.2.20,General,And strong enough to issue out and fight:

5207,5208,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.2.22,General,Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:

5234,5235,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.2.47,TALBOT,Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!
5235,5236,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.2.48,TALBOT,"If we be English deer, be then in blood,"
5236,5237,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.2.49,TALBOT,"Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,"
5237,5238,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.2.50,TALBOT,"But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,"
5238,5239,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.2.51,TALBOT,Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
5239,5240,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.2.52,TALBOT,And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:

5241,5242,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.2.54,TALBOT,"And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends."

5273,5274,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,4.3.26,YORK,So should we save a valiant gentleman

5275,5276,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,4.3.28,YORK,"Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,"
5276,5277,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,4.3.29,YORK,"That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep."

5290,5291,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.3.43,YORK,"Lucy, farewell, no more my fortune can,"
5291,5292,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.3.44,YORK,But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.

5307,5308,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.4.3,SOMERSET,Too rashly plotted: all our general force
5308,5309,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.4.4,SOMERSET,Might with a sally of the very town
5309,5310,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.4.5,SOMERSET,Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot
5310,5311,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.4.6,SOMERSET,Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
5311,5312,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.4.7,SOMERSET,"By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:"

5321,5322,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,4.4.16,LUCY,To beat assailing death from his weak legions:

5357,5358,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.3,TALBOT,That Talbot's name might be in thee revived
5358,5359,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.4,TALBOT,When sapless age and weak unable limbs
5359,5360,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.5,TALBOT,Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
5360,5361,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.6,TALBOT,"But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!"
5361,5362,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.7,TALBOT,"Now thou art come unto a feast of death,"
5362,5363,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.8,TALBOT,A terrible and unavoided danger:
5363,5364,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.9,TALBOT,"Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,"
5364,5365,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.10,TALBOT,And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
5365,5366,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,4.5.11,TALBOT,"By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone."
5366,5367,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.5.12,JOHN TALBOT,Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
5367,5368,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.5.13,JOHN TALBOT,"And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,"

5369,5370,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.5.15,JOHN TALBOT,To make a bastard and a slave of me!
5370,5371,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.5.16,JOHN TALBOT,"The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,"
5371,5372,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,4.5.17,JOHN TALBOT,That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
5372,5373,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,4.5.18,TALBOT,"Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain."
5373,5374,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,4.5.19,JOHN TALBOT,He that flies so will ne'er return again.

5376,5377,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.22,JOHN TALBOT,"Your loss is great, so your regard should be,"
5377,5378,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.23,JOHN TALBOT,"My worth unknown, no loss is known in me."
5378,5379,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.24,JOHN TALBOT,"Upon my death the French can little boast,"
5379,5380,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.25,JOHN TALBOT,"In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost."
5380,5381,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.26,JOHN TALBOT,"Flight cannot stain the honour you have won,"
5381,5382,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.27,JOHN TALBOT,"But mine it will, that no exploit have done:"
5382,5383,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.28,JOHN TALBOT,"You fled for vantage, everyone will swear,"
5383,5384,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.29,JOHN TALBOT,"But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear."
5384,5385,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.30,JOHN TALBOT,"There is no hope that ever I will stay,"
5385,5386,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.31,JOHN TALBOT,If the first hour I shrink and run away.
5386,5387,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.32,JOHN TALBOT,"Here on my knee I beg mortality,"
5387,5388,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,4.5.33,JOHN TALBOT,Rather than life preserved with infamy.
5388,5389,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,4.5.34,TALBOT,Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
5389,5390,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,4.5.35,JOHN TALBOT,"Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb."
5390,5391,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,4.5.36,TALBOT,"Upon my blessing, I command thee go."
5391,5392,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,4.5.37,JOHN TALBOT,"To fight I will, but not to fly the foe."
5392,5393,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,4.5.38,TALBOT,Part of thy father may be saved in thee.
5393,5394,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,4.5.39,JOHN TALBOT,No part of him but will be shame in me.
5394,5395,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,4.5.40,TALBOT,"Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it."

5455,5456,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,4.6.43,JOHN TALBOT,These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:

5463,5464,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,4.6.51,JOHN TALBOT,"An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:"
5464,5465,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,4.6.52,JOHN TALBOT,"Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot,"

5763,5764,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,5.3.82,SUFFOLK,Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
5764,5765,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,5.3.83,MARGARET,"I were best to leave him, for he will not hear."
5765,5766,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,5.3.84,SUFFOLK,"There all is marr'd, there lies a cooling card."
5766,5767,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,5.3.85,MARGARET,"He talks at random, sure, the man is mad."
5767,5768,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,5.3.86,SUFFOLK,And yet a dispensation may be had.
5768,5769,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,5.3.87,MARGARET,And yet I would that you would answer me.
5769,5770,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,5.3.88,SUFFOLK,I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
5770,5771,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,5.3.89,SUFFOLK,"Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!"
5771,5772,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,5.3.90,MARGARET,He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
5772,5773,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.3.91,SUFFOLK,"Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,"
5773,5774,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.3.92,SUFFOLK,And peace established between these realms
5774,5775,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.3.93,SUFFOLK,"But there remains a scruple in that too,"
5775,5776,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.3.94,SUFFOLK,"For though her father be the King of Naples,"
5776,5777,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.3.95,SUFFOLK,"Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,"
5777,5778,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.3.96,SUFFOLK,And our nobility will scorn the match.
5778,5779,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,5.3.97,MARGARET,"Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?"
5779,5780,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,5.3.98,SUFFOLK,"It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much."
5780,5781,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,5.3.99,SUFFOLK,Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
5781,5782,Henry VI Part 1,27.0,5.3.100,SUFFOLK,"Madam, I have a secret to reveal."
5782,5783,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,5.3.101,MARGARET,"What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,"
5783,5784,Henry VI Part 1,28.0,5.3.102,MARGARET,And will not any way dishonour me.
5784,5785,Henry VI Part 1,29.0,5.3.103,SUFFOLK,"Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say."
5785,5786,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,5.3.104,MARGARET,"Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French,"
5786,5787,Henry VI Part 1,30.0,5.3.105,MARGARET,And then I need not crave his courtesy.
5787,5788,Henry VI Part 1,31.0,5.3.106,SUFFOLK,"Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--"
5788,5789,Henry VI Part 1,32.0,5.3.107,MARGARET,"Tush, women have been captivate ere now."
5789,5790,Henry VI Part 1,33.0,5.3.108,SUFFOLK,"Lady, wherefore talk you so?"
5790,5791,Henry VI Part 1,34.0,5.3.109,MARGARET,"I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo."
5791,5792,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,5.3.110,SUFFOLK,"Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose"
5792,5793,Henry VI Part 1,35.0,5.3.111,SUFFOLK,"Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?"
5793,5794,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,5.3.112,MARGARET,To be a queen in bondage is more vile
5794,5795,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,5.3.113,MARGARET,"Than is a slave in base servility,"
5795,5796,Henry VI Part 1,36.0,5.3.114,MARGARET,For princes should be free.
5796,5797,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,5.3.115,SUFFOLK,"And so shall you,"
5797,5798,Henry VI Part 1,37.0,5.3.116,SUFFOLK,If happy England's royal king be free.
5798,5799,Henry VI Part 1,38.0,5.3.117,MARGARET,"Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?"
5799,5800,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,5.3.118,SUFFOLK,"I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,"
5800,5801,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,5.3.119,SUFFOLK,To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
5801,5802,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,5.3.120,SUFFOLK,"And set a precious crown upon thy head,"
5802,5803,Henry VI Part 1,39.0,5.3.121,SUFFOLK,If thou wilt condescend to be my--
5803,5804,Henry VI Part 1,40.0,5.3.122,MARGARET,What?
5804,5805,Henry VI Part 1,41.0,5.3.123,SUFFOLK,His love.
5805,5806,Henry VI Part 1,42.0,5.3.124,MARGARET,I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
5806,5807,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,5.3.125,SUFFOLK,"No, gentle madam, I unworthy am"
5807,5808,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,5.3.126,SUFFOLK,"To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,"
5808,5809,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,5.3.127,SUFFOLK,And have no portion in the choice myself.
5809,5810,Henry VI Part 1,43.0,5.3.128,SUFFOLK,"How say you, madam, are ye so content?"
5810,5811,Henry VI Part 1,44.0,5.3.129,MARGARET,"An if my father please, I am content."
5811,5812,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,5.3.130,SUFFOLK,Then call our captains and our colours forth.
5812,5813,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,5.3.131,SUFFOLK,"And, madam, at your father's castle walls"
5813,5814,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,5.3.132,SUFFOLK,"We'll crave a parley, to confer with him."
5814,5815,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,,SUFFOLK,A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls
5815,5816,Henry VI Part 1,45.0,5.3.133,SUFFOLK,"See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!"
5816,5817,Henry VI Part 1,46.0,5.3.134,REIGNIER,To whom?
5817,5818,Henry VI Part 1,47.0,5.3.135,SUFFOLK,To me.
5818,5819,Henry VI Part 1,48.0,5.3.136,REIGNIER,"Suffolk, what remedy?"
5819,5820,Henry VI Part 1,48.0,5.3.137,REIGNIER,"I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,"
5820,5821,Henry VI Part 1,48.0,5.3.138,REIGNIER,Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.
5821,5822,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,5.3.139,SU FFOLK,"Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:"
5822,5823,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,5.3.140,SU FFOLK,"Consent, and for thy honour give consent,"
5823,5824,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,5.3.141,SU FFOLK,"Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,"
5824,5825,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,5.3.142,SU FFOLK,"Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto,"
5825,5826,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,5.3.143,SU FFOLK,And this her easy-held imprisonment
5826,5827,Henry VI Part 1,49.0,5.3.144,SU FFOLK,Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
5827,5828,Henry VI Part 1,50.0,5.3.145,REIGNIER,Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
5828,5829,Henry VI Part 1,51.0,5.3.146,SUFFOLK,Fair Margaret knows
5829,5830,Henry VI Part 1,51.0,5.3.147,SUFFOLK,"That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign."
5830,5831,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,5.3.148,REIGNIER,"Upon thy princely warrant, I descend"
5831,5832,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,5.3.149,REIGNIER,To give thee answer of thy just demand.
5832,5833,Henry VI Part 1,52.0,,REIGNIER,Exit from the walls
5833,5834,Henry VI Part 1,53.0,5.3.150,SUFFOLK,And here I will expect thy coming.
5834,5835,Henry VI Part 1,53.0,,SUFFOLK,"Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below"
5835,5836,Henry VI Part 1,54.0,5.3.151,REIGNIER,"Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:"
5836,5837,Henry VI Part 1,54.0,5.3.152,REIGNIER,Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.
5837,5838,Henry VI Part 1,55.0,5.3.153,SUFFOLK,"Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,"
5838,5839,Henry VI Part 1,55.0,5.3.154,SUFFOLK,Fit to be made companion with a king:
5839,5840,Henry VI Part 1,55.0,5.3.155,SUFFOLK,What answer makes your grace unto my suit?
5840,5841,Henry VI Part 1,56.0,5.3.156,REIGNIER,Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
5841,5842,Henry VI Part 1,56.0,5.3.157,REIGNIER,"To be the princely bride of such a lord,"
5842,5843,Henry VI Part 1,56.0,5.3.158,REIGNIER,Upon condition I may quietly
5843,5844,Henry VI Part 1,56.0,5.3.159,REIGNIER,"Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,"
5844,5845,Henry VI Part 1,56.0,5.3.160,REIGNIER,"Free from oppression or the stroke of war,"
5845,5846,Henry VI Part 1,56.0,5.3.161,REIGNIER,"My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please."
5846,5847,Henry VI Part 1,57.0,5.3.162,SUFFOLK,"That is her ransom, I deliver her,"
5847,5848,Henry VI Part 1,57.0,5.3.163,SUFFOLK,And those two counties I will undertake
5848,5849,Henry VI Part 1,57.0,5.3.164,SUFFOLK,Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
5849,5850,Henry VI Part 1,58.0,5.3.165,REIGNIER,"And I again, in Henry's royal name,"
5850,5851,Henry VI Part 1,58.0,5.3.166,REIGNIER,"As deputy unto that gracious king,"
5851,5852,Henry VI Part 1,58.0,5.3.167,REIGNIER,"Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith."
5852,5853,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.168,SUFFOLK,"Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,"
5853,5854,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.169,SUFFOLK,Because this is in traffic of a king.
5854,5855,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,,SUFFOLK,Aside
5855,5856,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.170,SUFFOLK,"And yet, methinks, I could be well content"
5856,5857,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.171,SUFFOLK,To be mine own attorney in this case.
5857,5858,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.172,SUFFOLK,"I'll over then to England with this news,"
5858,5859,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.173,SUFFOLK,And make this marriage to be solemnized.
5859,5860,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.174,SUFFOLK,"So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe"
5860,5861,Henry VI Part 1,59.0,5.3.175,SUFFOLK,"In golden palaces, as it becomes."
5861,5862,Henry VI Part 1,60.0,5.3.176,REIGNIER,"I do embrace thee, as I would embrace"
5862,5863,Henry VI Part 1,60.0,5.3.177,REIGNIER,"The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here."
5863,5864,Henry VI Part 1,61.0,5.3.178,MARGARET,"Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers"
5864,5865,Henry VI Part 1,61.0,5.3.179,MARGARET,Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
5865,5866,Henry VI Part 1,61.0,,MARGARET,Going
5866,5867,Henry VI Part 1,62.0,5.3.180,SUFFOLK,"Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret,"
5867,5868,Henry VI Part 1,62.0,5.3.181,SUFFOLK,No princely commendations to my king?
5868,5869,Henry VI Part 1,63.0,5.3.182,MARGARET,"Such commendations as becomes a maid,"
5869,5870,Henry VI Part 1,63.0,5.3.183,MARGARET,"A virgin and his servant, say to him."
5870,5871,Henry VI Part 1,64.0,5.3.184,SUFFOLK,Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
5871,5872,Henry VI Part 1,64.0,5.3.185,SUFFOLK,"But madam, I must trouble you again,"
5872,5873,Henry VI Part 1,64.0,5.3.186,SUFFOLK,No loving token to his majesty?
5873,5874,Henry VI Part 1,65.0,5.3.187,MARGARET,"Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,"
5874,5875,Henry VI Part 1,65.0,5.3.188,MARGARET,"Never yet taint with love, I send the king."
5875,5876,Henry VI Part 1,66.0,5.3.189,SUFFOLK,And this withal.
5876,5877,Henry VI Part 1,66.0,,SUFFOLK,Kisses her
5877,5878,Henry VI Part 1,67.0,5.3.190,MARGARET,That for thyself: I will not so presume
5878,5879,Henry VI Part 1,67.0,5.3.191,MARGARET,To send such peevish tokens to a king.
5879,5880,Henry VI Part 1,67.0,,MARGARET,Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
5880,5881,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.192,SUFFOLK,"O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay,"
5881,5882,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.193,SUFFOLK,"Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth,"
5882,5883,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.194,SUFFOLK,There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
5883,5884,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.195,SUFFOLK,Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
5884,5885,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.196,SUFFOLK,"Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,"
5885,5886,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.197,SUFFOLK,"And natural graces that extinguish art,"
5886,5887,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.198,SUFFOLK,"Repeat their semblance often on the seas,"
5887,5888,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.199,SUFFOLK,"That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,"
5888,5889,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,5.3.200,SUFFOLK,Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
5889,5890,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,,SUFFOLK,Exit
5890,5891,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,,SUFFOLK,SCENE IV. Camp of the YORK in Anjou.
5891,5892,Henry VI Part 1,68.0,,SUFFOLK,"Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others"
5892,5893,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,5.4.1,YORK,Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
5893,5894,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,,YORK,"Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd"
5894,5895,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.4.2,Shepherd,"Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!"
5895,5896,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.4.3,Shepherd,"Have I sought every country far and near,"
5896,5897,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.4.4,Shepherd,"And, now it is my chance to find thee out,"
5897,5898,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.4.5,Shepherd,Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
5898,5899,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.4.6,Shepherd,"Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!"
5899,5900,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,5.4.7,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
5900,5901,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,5.4.8,JOAN LA PUCELLE,I am descended of a gentler blood:
5901,5902,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,5.4.9,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
5902,5903,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.4.10,Shepherd,"Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so,"
5903,5904,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.4.11,Shepherd,"I did beget her, all the parish knows:"
5904,5905,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.4.12,Shepherd,"Her mother liveth yet, can testify"
5905,5906,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.4.13,Shepherd,She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.
5906,5907,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,5.4.14,WARWICK,Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
5907,5908,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,5.4.15,YORK,"This argues what her kind of life hath been,"
5908,5909,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,5.4.16,YORK,"Wicked and vile, and so her death concludes."
5909,5910,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.4.17,Shepherd,"Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!"
5910,5911,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.4.18,Shepherd,"God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,"
5911,5912,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.4.19,Shepherd,And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:
5912,5913,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.4.20,Shepherd,"Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan."
5913,5914,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,5.4.21,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,"
5914,5915,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,5.4.22,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
5915,5916,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.23,Shepherd,"'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest"
5916,5917,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.24,Shepherd,The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
5917,5918,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.25,Shepherd,"Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl."
5918,5919,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.26,Shepherd,Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
5919,5920,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.27,Shepherd,Of thy nativity! I would the milk
5920,5921,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.28,Shepherd,"Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,"
5921,5922,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.29,Shepherd,Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
5922,5923,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.30,Shepherd,"Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,"
5923,5924,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.31,Shepherd,I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
5924,5925,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.32,Shepherd,"Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?"
5925,5926,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.4.33,Shepherd,"O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good."
5926,5927,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,,Shepherd,Exit
5927,5928,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.4.34,YORK,"Take her away, for she hath lived too long,"
5928,5929,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.4.35,YORK,To fill the world with vicious qualities.
5929,5930,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.36,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:"
5930,5931,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.37,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,"
5931,5932,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.38,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But issued from the progeny of kings,"
5932,5933,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.39,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Virtuous and holy, chosen from above,"
5933,5934,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.40,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"By inspiration of celestial grace,"
5934,5935,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.41,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To work exceeding miracles on earth.
5935,5936,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.42,JOAN LA PUCELLE,I never had to do with wicked spirits:
5936,5937,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.43,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But you, that are polluted with your lusts,"
5937,5938,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.44,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,"
5938,5939,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.45,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,"
5939,5940,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.46,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Because you want the grace that others have,"
5940,5941,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.47,JOAN LA PUCELLE,You judge it straight a thing impossible
5941,5942,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.48,JOAN LA PUCELLE,To compass wonders but by help of devils.
5942,5943,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.49,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been"

5945,5946,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.52,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,"
5946,5947,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.4.53,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
5947,5948,Henry VI Part 1,12.0,5.4.54,YORK,"Ay, ay: away with her to execution!"
5948,5949,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,5.4.55,WARWICK,"And hark ye, sirs, because she is a maid,"
5949,5950,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,5.4.56,WARWICK,"Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:"
5950,5951,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,5.4.57,WARWICK,"Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,"
5951,5952,Henry VI Part 1,13.0,5.4.58,WARWICK,That so her torture may be shortened.
5952,5953,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,5.4.59,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
5953,5954,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,5.4.60,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,"
5954,5955,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,5.4.61,JOAN LA PUCELLE,That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
5955,5956,Henry VI Part 1,14.0,5.4.62,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"I am with child, ye bloody homicides:"

5959,5960,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,5.4.66,WARWICK,The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
5960,5961,Henry VI Part 1,16.0,5.4.67,WARWICK,Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
5961,5962,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,5.4.68,YORK,She and the Dauphin have been juggling:
5962,5963,Henry VI Part 1,17.0,5.4.69,YORK,I did imagine what would be her refuge.
5963,5964,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,5.4.70,WARWICK,"Well, go to, we'll have no bastards live,"
5964,5965,Henry VI Part 1,18.0,5.4.71,WARWICK,Especially since Charles must father it.
5965,5966,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,5.4.72,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"You are deceived, my child is none of his:"
5966,5967,Henry VI Part 1,19.0,5.4.73,JOAN LA PUCELLE,It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
5967,5968,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,5.4.74,YORK,Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!
5968,5969,Henry VI Part 1,20.0,5.4.75,YORK,"It dies, an if it had a thousand lives."
5969,5970,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,5.4.76,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"O, give me leave, I have deluded you:"
5970,5971,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,5.4.77,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,"
5971,5972,Henry VI Part 1,21.0,5.4.78,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd."
5972,5973,Henry VI Part 1,22.0,5.4.79,WARWICK,A married man! that's most intolerable.
5973,5974,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,5.4.80,YORK,"Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,"
5974,5975,Henry VI Part 1,23.0,5.4.81,YORK,"There were so many, whom she may accuse."
5975,5976,Henry VI Part 1,24.0,5.4.82,WARWICK,It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
5976,5977,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.4.83,YORK,"And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure."
5977,5978,Henry VI Part 1,25.0,5.4.84,YORK,"Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:"

5979,5980,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,5.4.86,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Then lead me hence, with whom I leave my curse:"
5980,5981,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,5.4.87,JOAN LA PUCELLE,May never glorious sun reflex his beams
5981,5982,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,5.4.88,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Upon the country where you make abode,"
5982,5983,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,5.4.89,JOAN LA PUCELLE,But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
5983,5984,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,5.4.90,JOAN LA PUCELLE,"Environ you, till mischief and despair"
5984,5985,Henry VI Part 1,26.0,5.4.91,JOAN LA PUCELLE,Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!

6080,6081,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,5.5.4,KING HENRY VI,Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
6081,6082,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,5.5.5,KING HENRY VI,And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
6082,6083,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,5.5.6,KING HENRY VI,"Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,"
6083,6084,Henry VI Part 1,1.0,5.5.7,KING HENRY VI,So am I driven by breath of her renown

6087,6088,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.11,SUFFOLK,"Is but a preface of her worthy praise,"
6088,6089,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.12,SUFFOLK,The chief perfections of that lovely dame

6090,6091,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.14,SUFFOLK,"Would make a volume of enticing lines,"
6091,6092,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.15,SUFFOLK,Able to ravish any dull conceit:
6092,6093,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.16,SUFFOLK,"And, which is more, she is not so divine,"
6093,6094,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.17,SUFFOLK,"So full-replete with choice of all delights,"
6094,6095,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.18,SUFFOLK,But with as humble lowliness of mind
6095,6096,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.19,SUFFOLK,"She is content to be at your command,"
6096,6097,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.20,SUFFOLK,"Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,"
6097,6098,Henry VI Part 1,2.0,5.5.21,SUFFOLK,To love and honour Henry as her lord.
6098,6099,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,5.5.22,KING HENRY VI,And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
6099,6100,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,5.5.23,KING HENRY VI,"Therefore, my lord protector, give consent"
6100,6101,Henry VI Part 1,3.0,5.5.24,KING HENRY VI,That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
6101,6102,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.5.25,GLOUCESTER,So should I give consent to flatter sin.
6102,6103,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.5.26,GLOUCESTER,"You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd"
6103,6104,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.5.27,GLOUCESTER,Unto another lady of esteem:
6104,6105,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.5.28,GLOUCESTER,"How shall we then dispense with that contract,"
6105,6106,Henry VI Part 1,4.0,5.5.29,GLOUCESTER,And not deface your honour with reproach?
6106,6107,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,5.5.30,SUFFOLK,"As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,"
6107,6108,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,5.5.31,SUFFOLK,"Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd"
6108,6109,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,5.5.32,SUFFOLK,"To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists"
6109,6110,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,5.5.33,SUFFOLK,By reason of his adversary's odds:
6110,6111,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,5.5.34,SUFFOLK,"A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,"
6111,6112,Henry VI Part 1,5.0,5.5.35,SUFFOLK,And therefore may be broke without offence.
6112,6113,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,5.5.36,GLOUCESTER,"Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?"
6113,6114,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,5.5.37,GLOUCESTER,"Her father is no better than an earl,"
6114,6115,Henry VI Part 1,6.0,5.5.38,GLOUCESTER,Although in glorious titles he excel.
6115,6116,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.5.39,SUFFOLK,"Yes, lord, her father is a king,"
6116,6117,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.5.40,SUFFOLK,"The King of Naples and Jerusalem,"
6117,6118,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.5.41,SUFFOLK,And of such great authority in France
6118,6119,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.5.42,SUFFOLK,As his alliance will confirm our peace
6119,6120,Henry VI Part 1,7.0,5.5.43,SUFFOLK,And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
6120,6121,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,5.5.44,GLOUCESTER,"And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,"
6121,6122,Henry VI Part 1,8.0,5.5.45,GLOUCESTER,Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
6122,6123,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.5.46,EXETER,"Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,"
6123,6124,Henry VI Part 1,9.0,5.5.47,EXETER,Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
6124,6125,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.48,SUFFOLK,"A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,"
6125,6126,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.49,SUFFOLK,"That he should be so abject, base and poor,"
6126,6127,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.50,SUFFOLK,To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
6127,6128,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.51,SUFFOLK,Henry is able to enrich his queen
6128,6129,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.52,SUFFOLK,And not seek a queen to make him rich:

6130,6131,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.54,SUFFOLK,"As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse."
6131,6132,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.55,SUFFOLK,Marriage is a matter of more worth
6132,6133,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.56,SUFFOLK,"Than to be dealt in by attorneyship,"

6136,6137,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.60,SUFFOLK,"It most of all these reasons bindeth us,"
6137,6138,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.61,SUFFOLK,In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
6138,6139,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.62,SUFFOLK,"For what is wedlock forced but a hell,"
6139,6140,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.63,SUFFOLK,An age of discord and continual strife?
6140,6141,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.64,SUFFOLK,"Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,"
6141,6142,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.65,SUFFOLK,And is a pattern of celestial peace.

6145,6146,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.69,SUFFOLK,Approves her fit for none but for a king:
6146,6147,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.70,SUFFOLK,"Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,"
6147,6148,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.71,SUFFOLK,"More than in women commonly is seen,"
6148,6149,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.72,SUFFOLK,"Will answer our hope in issue of a king,"
6149,6150,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.73,SUFFOLK,"For Henry, son unto a conqueror,"
6150,6151,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.74,SUFFOLK,"Is likely to beget more conquerors,"
6151,6152,Henry VI Part 1,10.0,5.5.75,SUFFOLK,If with a lady of so high resolve

6161,6162,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.5.85,KING HENRY VI,"Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,"
6162,6163,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.5.86,KING HENRY VI,As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
6163,6164,Henry VI Part 1,11.0,5.5.87,KING HENRY VI,"Take, therefore, shipping, post, my lord, to France,"

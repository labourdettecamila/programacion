72001,72002,Othello,59.0,,BENEDICK,SCENE I. Venice. A street.
72002,72003,Othello,59.0,,BENEDICK,Enter RODERIGO and IAGO
72003,72004,Othello,1.0,1.1.1,RODERIGO,"Tush! never tell me, I take it much unkindly"
72004,72005,Othello,1.0,1.1.2,RODERIGO,"That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse"
72005,72006,Othello,1.0,1.1.3,RODERIGO,"As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this."
72006,72007,Othello,2.0,1.1.4,IAGO,"'Sblood, but you will not hear me:"
72007,72008,Othello,2.0,1.1.5,IAGO,"If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me."
72008,72009,Othello,3.0,1.1.6,RODERIGO,Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
72009,72010,Othello,4.0,1.1.7,IAGO,"Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,"
72010,72011,Othello,4.0,1.1.8,IAGO,"In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,"
72011,72012,Othello,4.0,1.1.9,IAGO,"Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,"
72012,72013,Othello,4.0,1.1.10,IAGO,"I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:"
72013,72014,Othello,4.0,1.1.11,IAGO,"But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,"
72014,72015,Othello,4.0,1.1.12,IAGO,"Evades them, with a bombast circumstance"
72015,72016,Othello,4.0,1.1.13,IAGO,"Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war,"
72016,72017,Othello,4.0,1.1.14,IAGO,"And, in conclusion,"
72017,72018,Othello,4.0,1.1.15,IAGO,"Nonsuits my mediators, for, 'Certes,' says he,"
72018,72019,Othello,4.0,1.1.16,IAGO,'I have already chose my officer.'
72019,72020,Othello,4.0,1.1.17,IAGO,And what was he?
72020,72021,Othello,4.0,1.1.18,IAGO,"Forsooth, a great arithmetician,"
72021,72022,Othello,4.0,1.1.19,IAGO,"One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,"
72022,72023,Othello,4.0,1.1.20,IAGO,"A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife,"
72023,72024,Othello,4.0,1.1.21,IAGO,"That never set a squadron in the field,"
72024,72025,Othello,4.0,1.1.22,IAGO,Nor the division of a battle knows
72025,72026,Othello,4.0,1.1.23,IAGO,"More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,"
72026,72027,Othello,4.0,1.1.24,IAGO,Wherein the toged consuls can propose
72027,72028,Othello,4.0,1.1.25,IAGO,"As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,"
72028,72029,Othello,4.0,1.1.26,IAGO,"Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:"
72029,72030,Othello,4.0,1.1.27,IAGO,"And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof"
72030,72031,Othello,4.0,1.1.28,IAGO,"At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds"
72031,72032,Othello,4.0,1.1.29,IAGO,"Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd"
72032,72033,Othello,4.0,1.1.30,IAGO,"By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,"
72033,72034,Othello,4.0,1.1.31,IAGO,"He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,"
72034,72035,Othello,4.0,1.1.32,IAGO,And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.
72035,72036,Othello,5.0,1.1.33,RODERIGO,"By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman."
72036,72037,Othello,6.0,1.1.34,IAGO,"Why, there's no remedy, 'tis the curse of service,"
72037,72038,Othello,6.0,1.1.35,IAGO,"Preferment goes by letter and affection,"
72038,72039,Othello,6.0,1.1.36,IAGO,"And not by old gradation, where each second"
72039,72040,Othello,6.0,1.1.37,IAGO,"Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,"
72040,72041,Othello,6.0,1.1.38,IAGO,Whether I in any just term am affined
72041,72042,Othello,6.0,1.1.39,IAGO,To love the Moor.
72042,72043,Othello,7.0,1.1.40,RODERIGO,I would not follow him then.
72043,72044,Othello,8.0,1.1.41,IAGO,"O, sir, content you,"
72044,72045,Othello,8.0,1.1.42,IAGO,I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
72045,72046,Othello,8.0,1.1.43,IAGO,"We cannot all be masters, nor all masters"
72046,72047,Othello,8.0,1.1.44,IAGO,Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
72047,72048,Othello,8.0,1.1.45,IAGO,"Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,"
72048,72049,Othello,8.0,1.1.46,IAGO,"That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,"
72049,72050,Othello,8.0,1.1.47,IAGO,"Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,"
72050,72051,Othello,8.0,1.1.48,IAGO,"For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:"
72051,72052,Othello,8.0,1.1.49,IAGO,Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
72052,72053,Othello,8.0,1.1.50,IAGO,"Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,"
72053,72054,Othello,8.0,1.1.51,IAGO,"Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,"
72054,72055,Othello,8.0,1.1.52,IAGO,"And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,"
72055,72056,Othello,8.0,1.1.53,IAGO,Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
72056,72057,Othello,8.0,1.1.54,IAGO,their coats
72057,72058,Othello,8.0,1.1.55,IAGO,"Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul,"
72058,72059,Othello,8.0,1.1.56,IAGO,"And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,"
72059,72060,Othello,8.0,1.1.57,IAGO,"It is as sure as you are Roderigo,"
72060,72061,Othello,8.0,1.1.58,IAGO,"Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:"
72061,72062,Othello,8.0,1.1.59,IAGO,"In following him, I follow but myself,"
72062,72063,Othello,8.0,1.1.60,IAGO,"Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,"
72063,72064,Othello,8.0,1.1.61,IAGO,"But seeming so, for my peculiar end:"
72064,72065,Othello,8.0,1.1.62,IAGO,For when my outward action doth demonstrate
72065,72066,Othello,8.0,1.1.63,IAGO,The native act and figure of my heart
72066,72067,Othello,8.0,1.1.64,IAGO,"In compliment extern, 'tis not long after"
72067,72068,Othello,8.0,1.1.65,IAGO,But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
72068,72069,Othello,8.0,1.1.66,IAGO,For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
72069,72070,Othello,9.0,1.1.67,RODERIGO,What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
72070,72071,Othello,9.0,1.1.68,RODERIGO,If he can carry't thus!
72071,72072,Othello,10.0,1.1.69,IAGO,"Call up her father,"
72072,72073,Othello,10.0,1.1.70,IAGO,"Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,"
72073,72074,Othello,10.0,1.1.71,IAGO,"Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,"
72074,72075,Othello,10.0,1.1.72,IAGO,"And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,"
72075,72076,Othello,10.0,1.1.73,IAGO,"Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,"
72076,72077,Othello,10.0,1.1.74,IAGO,"Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,"
72077,72078,Othello,10.0,1.1.75,IAGO,As it may lose some colour.
72078,72079,Othello,11.0,1.1.76,RODERIGO,"Here is her father's house, I'll call aloud."
72079,72080,Othello,12.0,1.1.77,IAGO,"Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell"
72080,72081,Othello,12.0,1.1.78,IAGO,"As when, by night and negligence, the fire"
72081,72082,Othello,12.0,1.1.79,IAGO,Is spied in populous cities.
72082,72083,Othello,13.0,1.1.80,RODERIGO,"What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!"
72083,72084,Othello,14.0,1.1.81,IAGO,"Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!"
72084,72085,Othello,14.0,1.1.82,IAGO,"Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!"
72085,72086,Othello,14.0,1.1.83,IAGO,Thieves! thieves!
72086,72087,Othello,14.0,,IAGO,"BRABANTIO appears above, at a window"
72087,72088,Othello,15.0,1.1.84,BRABANTIO,What is the reason of this terrible summons?
72088,72089,Othello,15.0,1.1.85,BRABANTIO,What is the matter there?
72089,72090,Othello,16.0,1.1.86,RODERIGO,"Signior, is all your family within?"
72090,72091,Othello,17.0,1.1.87,IAGO,Are your doors lock'd?
72091,72092,Othello,18.0,1.1.88,BRABANTIO,"Why, wherefore ask you this?"
72092,72093,Othello,19.0,1.1.89,IAGO,"'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd, for shame, put on"
72093,72094,Othello,19.0,1.1.90,IAGO,"your gown,"
72094,72095,Othello,19.0,1.1.91,IAGO,"Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul,"
72095,72096,Othello,19.0,1.1.92,IAGO,"Even now, now, very now, an old black ram"
72096,72097,Othello,19.0,1.1.93,IAGO,"Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise,"
72097,72098,Othello,19.0,1.1.94,IAGO,"Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,"
72098,72099,Othello,19.0,1.1.95,IAGO,Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
72099,72100,Othello,19.0,1.1.96,IAGO,"Arise, I say."
72100,72101,Othello,20.0,1.1.97,BRABANTIO,"What, have you lost your wits?"
72101,72102,Othello,21.0,1.1.98,RODERIGO,"Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?"
72102,72103,Othello,22.0,1.1.99,BRABANTIO,Not I	what are you?
72103,72104,Othello,23.0,1.1.100,RODERIGO,My name is Roderigo.
72104,72105,Othello,24.0,1.1.101,BRABANTIO,The worser welcome:
72105,72106,Othello,24.0,1.1.102,BRABANTIO,I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
72106,72107,Othello,24.0,1.1.103,BRABANTIO,In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
72107,72108,Othello,24.0,1.1.104,BRABANTIO,"My daughter is not for thee, and now, in madness,"
72108,72109,Othello,24.0,1.1.105,BRABANTIO,"Being full of supper and distempering draughts,"
72109,72110,Othello,24.0,1.1.106,BRABANTIO,"Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come"
72110,72111,Othello,24.0,1.1.107,BRABANTIO,To start my quiet.
72111,72112,Othello,25.0,1.1.108,RODERIGO,"Sir, sir, sir,--"
72112,72113,Othello,26.0,1.1.109,BRABANTIO,But thou must needs be sure
72113,72114,Othello,26.0,1.1.110,BRABANTIO,My spirit and my place have in them power
72114,72115,Othello,26.0,1.1.111,BRABANTIO,To make this bitter to thee.
72115,72116,Othello,27.0,1.1.112,RODERIGO,"Patience, good sir."
72116,72117,Othello,28.0,1.1.113,BRABANTIO,"What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice,"
72117,72118,Othello,28.0,1.1.114,BRABANTIO,My house is not a grange.
72118,72119,Othello,29.0,1.1.115,RODERIGO,"Most grave Brabantio,"
72119,72120,Othello,29.0,1.1.116,RODERIGO,In simple and pure soul I come to you.
72120,72121,Othello,30.0,1.1.117,IAGO,"'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not"
72121,72122,Othello,30.0,1.1.118,IAGO,"serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to"
72122,72123,Othello,30.0,1.1.119,IAGO,"do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll"
72123,72124,Othello,30.0,1.1.120,IAGO,"have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse,"
72124,72125,Othello,30.0,1.1.121,IAGO,"you'll have your nephews neigh to you, you'll have"
72125,72126,Othello,30.0,1.1.122,IAGO,coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
72126,72127,Othello,31.0,1.1.123,BRABANTIO,What profane wretch art thou?
72127,72128,Othello,32.0,1.1.124,IAGO,"I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter"
72128,72129,Othello,32.0,1.1.125,IAGO,and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
72129,72130,Othello,33.0,1.1.126,BRABANTIO,Thou art a villain.
72130,72131,Othello,34.0,1.1.127,IAGO,You are--a senator.
72131,72132,Othello,35.0,1.1.128,BRABANTIO,"This thou shalt answer, I know thee, Roderigo."
72132,72133,Othello,36.0,1.1.129,RODERIGO,"Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,"
72133,72134,Othello,36.0,1.1.130,RODERIGO,"If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,"
72134,72135,Othello,36.0,1.1.131,RODERIGO,"As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,"
72135,72136,Othello,36.0,1.1.132,RODERIGO,"At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,"
72136,72137,Othello,36.0,1.1.133,RODERIGO,"Transported, with no worse nor better guard"
72137,72138,Othello,36.0,1.1.134,RODERIGO,"But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,"
72138,72139,Othello,36.0,1.1.135,RODERIGO,To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
72139,72140,Othello,36.0,1.1.136,RODERIGO,"If this be known to you and your allowance,"
72140,72141,Othello,36.0,1.1.137,RODERIGO,"We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs,"
72141,72142,Othello,36.0,1.1.138,RODERIGO,"But if you know not this, my manners tell me"
72142,72143,Othello,36.0,1.1.139,RODERIGO,We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
72143,72144,Othello,36.0,1.1.140,RODERIGO,"That, from the sense of all civility,"
72144,72145,Othello,36.0,1.1.141,RODERIGO,I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
72145,72146,Othello,36.0,1.1.142,RODERIGO,"Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,"
72146,72147,Othello,36.0,1.1.143,RODERIGO,"I say again, hath made a gross revolt,"
72147,72148,Othello,36.0,1.1.144,RODERIGO,"Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes"
72148,72149,Othello,36.0,1.1.145,RODERIGO,In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
72149,72150,Othello,36.0,1.1.146,RODERIGO,Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
72150,72151,Othello,36.0,1.1.147,RODERIGO,"If she be in her chamber or your house,"
72151,72152,Othello,36.0,1.1.148,RODERIGO,Let loose on me the justice of the state
72152,72153,Othello,36.0,1.1.149,RODERIGO,For thus deluding you.
72153,72154,Othello,37.0,1.1.150,BRABANTIO,"Strike on the tinder, ho!"
72154,72155,Othello,37.0,1.1.151,BRABANTIO,Give me a taper! call up all my people!
72155,72156,Othello,37.0,1.1.152,BRABANTIO,This accident is not unlike my dream:
72156,72157,Othello,37.0,1.1.153,BRABANTIO,Belief of it oppresses me already.
72157,72158,Othello,37.0,1.1.154,BRABANTIO,"Light, I say! light!"
72158,72159,Othello,37.0,,BRABANTIO,Exit above
72159,72160,Othello,38.0,1.1.155,IAGO,"Farewell, for I must leave you:"
72160,72161,Othello,38.0,1.1.156,IAGO,"It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,"
72161,72162,Othello,38.0,1.1.157,IAGO,"To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--"
72162,72163,Othello,38.0,1.1.158,IAGO,"Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,"
72163,72164,Othello,38.0,1.1.159,IAGO,"However this may gall him with some cheque,"
72164,72165,Othello,38.0,1.1.160,IAGO,"Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd"
72165,72166,Othello,38.0,1.1.161,IAGO,"With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,"
72166,72167,Othello,38.0,1.1.162,IAGO,"Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,"
72167,72168,Othello,38.0,1.1.163,IAGO,"Another of his fathom they have none,"
72168,72169,Othello,38.0,1.1.164,IAGO,"To lead their business: in which regard,"
72169,72170,Othello,38.0,1.1.165,IAGO,Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
72170,72171,Othello,38.0,1.1.166,IAGO,"Yet, for necessity of present life,"
72171,72172,Othello,38.0,1.1.167,IAGO,"I must show out a flag and sign of love,"
72172,72173,Othello,38.0,1.1.168,IAGO,"Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,"
72173,72174,Othello,38.0,1.1.169,IAGO,"Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,"
72174,72175,Othello,38.0,1.1.170,IAGO,"And there will I be with him. So, farewell."
72175,72176,Othello,38.0,,IAGO,Exit
72176,72177,Othello,38.0,,IAGO,"Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches"
72177,72178,Othello,39.0,1.1.171,BRABANTIO,"It is too true an evil: gone she is,"
72178,72179,Othello,39.0,1.1.172,BRABANTIO,And what's to come of my despised time
72179,72180,Othello,39.0,1.1.173,BRABANTIO,"Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,"
72180,72181,Othello,39.0,1.1.174,BRABANTIO,Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
72181,72182,Othello,39.0,1.1.175,BRABANTIO,"With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!"

72185,72186,Othello,40.0,1.1.179,RODERIGO,"Truly, I think they are."
72186,72187,Othello,41.0,1.1.180,BRABANTIO,O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!

72248,72249,Othello,10.0,1.2.43,OTHELLO,"What is the matter, think you?"
72249,72250,Othello,11.0,1.2.44,CASSIO,Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
72250,72251,Othello,11.0,1.2.45,CASSIO,It is a business of some heat: the galleys
72251,72252,Othello,11.0,1.2.46,CASSIO,Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
72252,72253,Othello,11.0,1.2.47,CASSIO,"This very night at one another's heels,"

72283,72284,Othello,26.0,1.2.74,OTHELLO,Than with your weapons.
72284,72285,Othello,27.0,1.2.75,BRABANTIO,"O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?"
72285,72286,Othello,27.0,1.2.76,BRABANTIO,"Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,"
72286,72287,Othello,27.0,1.2.77,BRABANTIO,"For I'll refer me to all things of sense,"

72288,72289,Othello,27.0,1.2.79,BRABANTIO,"Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,"

72293,72294,Othello,27.0,1.2.84,BRABANTIO,"Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight."
72294,72295,Othello,27.0,1.2.85,BRABANTIO,"Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense"
72295,72296,Othello,27.0,1.2.86,BRABANTIO,"That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,"

72321,72322,Othello,32.0,1.2.112,BRABANTIO,In this time of the night! Bring him away:

72354,72355,Othello,11.0,1.3.24,First Senator,To keep us in false gaze. When we consider

72396,72397,Othello,22.0,1.3.63,BRABANTIO,And it is still itself.
72397,72398,Othello,23.0,1.3.64,DUKE OF VENICE,"Why, what's the matter?"
72398,72399,Othello,24.0,1.3.65,BRABANTIO,"My daughter! O, my daughter!"

72425,72426,Othello,34.0,1.3.92,OTHELLO,And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
72426,72427,Othello,34.0,1.3.93,OTHELLO,"For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,"

72443,72444,Othello,35.0,1.3.110,BRABANTIO,It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect

72446,72447,Othello,35.0,1.3.113,BRABANTIO,"To find out practises of cunning hell,"

72449,72450,Othello,35.0,1.3.116,BRABANTIO,"Or with some dram conjured to this effect,"
72450,72451,Othello,35.0,1.3.117,BRABANTIO,He wrought upon her.
72451,72452,Othello,36.0,1.3.118,DUKE OF VENICE,"To vouch this, is no proof,"

72453,72454,Othello,36.0,1.3.120,DUKE OF VENICE,Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods

72494,72495,Othello,42.0,1.3.160,OTHELLO,Would Desdemona seriously incline:
72495,72496,Othello,42.0,1.3.161,OTHELLO,But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
72496,72497,Othello,42.0,1.3.162,OTHELLO,"Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,"
72497,72498,Othello,42.0,1.3.163,OTHELLO,"She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear"

72504,72505,Othello,42.0,1.3.170,OTHELLO,"And often did beguile her of her tears,"
72505,72506,Othello,42.0,1.3.171,OTHELLO,When I did speak of some distressful stroke
72506,72507,Othello,42.0,1.3.172,OTHELLO,"That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,"

72513,72514,Othello,42.0,1.3.179,OTHELLO,I should but teach him how to tell my story.
72514,72515,Othello,42.0,1.3.180,OTHELLO,And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
72515,72516,Othello,42.0,1.3.181,OTHELLO,"She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,"
72516,72517,Othello,42.0,1.3.182,OTHELLO,And I loved her that she did pity them.
72517,72518,Othello,42.0,1.3.183,OTHELLO,This only is the witchcraft I have used:

72522,72523,Othello,43.0,1.3.187,DUKE OF VENICE,Take up this mangled matter at the best:
72523,72524,Othello,43.0,1.3.188,DUKE OF VENICE,Men do their broken weapons rather use
72524,72525,Othello,43.0,1.3.189,DUKE OF VENICE,Than their bare hands.
72525,72526,Othello,44.0,1.3.190,BRABANTIO,"I pray you, hear her speak:"
72526,72527,Othello,44.0,1.3.191,BRABANTIO,"If she confess that she was half the wooer,"
72527,72528,Othello,44.0,1.3.192,BRABANTIO,"Destruction on my head, if my bad blame"

72530,72531,Othello,44.0,1.3.195,BRABANTIO,Where most you owe obedience?
72531,72532,Othello,45.0,1.3.196,DESDEMONA,"My noble father,"
72532,72533,Othello,45.0,1.3.197,DESDEMONA,I do perceive here a divided duty:
72533,72534,Othello,45.0,1.3.198,DESDEMONA,"To you I am bound for life and education,"
72534,72535,Othello,45.0,1.3.199,DESDEMONA,My life and education both do learn me
72535,72536,Othello,45.0,1.3.200,DESDEMONA,"How to respect you, you are the lord of duty,"
72536,72537,Othello,45.0,1.3.201,DESDEMONA,"I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,"
72537,72538,Othello,45.0,1.3.202,DESDEMONA,And so much duty as my mother show'd
72538,72539,Othello,45.0,1.3.203,DESDEMONA,"To you, preferring you before her father,"
72539,72540,Othello,45.0,1.3.204,DESDEMONA,So much I challenge that I may profess

72542,72543,Othello,46.0,1.3.207,BRABANTIO,"Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:"
72543,72544,Othello,46.0,1.3.208,BRABANTIO,I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
72544,72545,Othello,46.0,1.3.209,BRABANTIO,"Come hither, Moor:"

72548,72549,Othello,46.0,1.3.213,BRABANTIO,I am glad at soul I have no other child:
72549,72550,Othello,46.0,1.3.214,BRABANTIO,"For thy escape would teach me tyranny,"
72550,72551,Othello,46.0,1.3.215,BRABANTIO,"To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord."

72731,72732,Othello,80.0,1.3.393,IAGO,"thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many"
72732,72733,Othello,80.0,1.3.394,IAGO,events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
72733,72734,Othello,80.0,1.3.395,IAGO,"Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more"
72734,72735,Othello,80.0,1.3.396,IAGO,of this to-morrow. Adieu.

72736,72737,Othello,82.0,1.3.398,IAGO,At my lodging.
72737,72738,Othello,83.0,1.3.399,RODERIGO,I'll be with thee betimes.
72738,72739,Othello,84.0,1.3.400,IAGO,"Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?"
72739,72740,Othello,85.0,1.3.401,RODERIGO,What say you?
72740,72741,Othello,86.0,1.3.402,IAGO,"No more of drowning, do you hear?"
72741,72742,Othello,87.0,1.3.403,RODERIGO,I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

72745,72746,Othello,88.0,1.3.406,IAGO,If I would time expend with such a snipe.
72746,72747,Othello,88.0,1.3.407,IAGO,But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
72747,72748,Othello,88.0,1.3.408,IAGO,"And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets"
72748,72749,Othello,88.0,1.3.409,IAGO,"He has done my office: I know not if't be true,"
72749,72750,Othello,88.0,1.3.410,IAGO,"But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,"
72750,72751,Othello,88.0,1.3.411,IAGO,"Will do as if for surety. He holds me well,"
72751,72752,Othello,88.0,1.3.412,IAGO,The better shall my purpose work on him.
72752,72753,Othello,88.0,1.3.413,IAGO,Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
72753,72754,Othello,88.0,1.3.414,IAGO,To get his place and to plume up my will
72754,72755,Othello,88.0,1.3.415,IAGO,"In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--"
72755,72756,Othello,88.0,1.3.416,IAGO,"After some time, to abuse Othello's ear"
72756,72757,Othello,88.0,1.3.417,IAGO,That he is too familiar with his wife.
72757,72758,Othello,88.0,1.3.418,IAGO,He hath a person and a smooth dispose
72758,72759,Othello,88.0,1.3.419,IAGO,"To be suspected, framed to make women false."
72759,72760,Othello,88.0,1.3.420,IAGO,"The Moor is of a free and open nature,"
72760,72761,Othello,88.0,1.3.421,IAGO,"That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,"
72761,72762,Othello,88.0,1.3.422,IAGO,And will as tenderly be led by the nose
72762,72763,Othello,88.0,1.3.423,IAGO,As asses are.
72763,72764,Othello,88.0,1.3.424,IAGO,I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
72764,72765,Othello,88.0,1.3.425,IAGO,Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
72765,72766,Othello,88.0,,IAGO,Exit

72771,72772,Othello,2.0,2.1.3,First Gentleman,"I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,"
72772,72773,Othello,2.0,2.1.4,First Gentleman,Descry a sail.
72773,72774,Othello,3.0,2.1.5,MONTANO,"Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land,"
72774,72775,Othello,3.0,2.1.6,MONTANO,A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
72775,72776,Othello,3.0,2.1.7,MONTANO,"If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,"
72776,72777,Othello,3.0,2.1.8,MONTANO,"What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,"
72777,72778,Othello,3.0,2.1.9,MONTANO,Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
72778,72779,Othello,4.0,2.1.10,Second Gentleman,A segregation of the Turkish fleet:

72780,72781,Othello,4.0,2.1.12,Second Gentleman,"The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,"
72781,72782,Othello,4.0,2.1.13,Second Gentleman,"The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,"
72782,72783,Othello,4.0,2.1.14,Second Gentleman,"seems to cast water on the burning bear,"
72783,72784,Othello,4.0,2.1.15,Second Gentleman,And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
72784,72785,Othello,4.0,2.1.16,Second Gentleman,I never did like molestation view
72785,72786,Othello,4.0,2.1.17,Second Gentleman,On the enchafed flood.
72786,72787,Othello,5.0,2.1.18,MONTANO,If that the Turkish fleet
72787,72788,Othello,5.0,2.1.19,MONTANO,"Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:"
72788,72789,Othello,5.0,2.1.20,MONTANO,It is impossible they bear it out.

72792,72793,Othello,6.0,2.1.23,Third Gentleman,That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
72793,72794,Othello,6.0,2.1.24,Third Gentleman,Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
72794,72795,Othello,6.0,2.1.25,Third Gentleman,On most part of their fleet.
72795,72796,Othello,7.0,2.1.26,MONTANO,How! is this true?
72796,72797,Othello,8.0,2.1.27,Third Gentleman,"The ship is here put in,"
72797,72798,Othello,8.0,2.1.28,Third Gentleman,"A Veronesa, Michael Cassio,"

72802,72803,Othello,10.0,2.1.33,Third Gentleman,"But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort"
72803,72804,Othello,10.0,2.1.34,Third Gentleman,"Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,"
72804,72805,Othello,10.0,2.1.35,Third Gentleman,"And prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted"
72805,72806,Othello,10.0,2.1.36,Third Gentleman,With foul and violent tempest.
72806,72807,Othello,11.0,2.1.37,MONTANO,"Pray heavens he be,"
72807,72808,Othello,11.0,2.1.38,MONTANO,"For I have served him, and the man commands"
72808,72809,Othello,11.0,2.1.39,MONTANO,"Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!"
72809,72810,Othello,11.0,2.1.40,MONTANO,As well to see the vessel that's come in
72810,72811,Othello,11.0,2.1.41,MONTANO,"As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,"
72811,72812,Othello,11.0,2.1.42,MONTANO,Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
72812,72813,Othello,11.0,2.1.43,MONTANO,An indistinct regard.
72813,72814,Othello,12.0,2.1.44,Third Gentleman,"Come, let's do so:"
72814,72815,Othello,12.0,2.1.45,Third Gentleman,For every minute is expectancy
72815,72816,Othello,12.0,2.1.46,Third Gentleman,Of more arrivance.
72816,72817,Othello,12.0,,Third Gentleman,Enter CASSIO
72817,72818,Othello,13.0,2.1.47,CASSIO,"Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,"

72820,72821,Othello,13.0,2.1.50,CASSIO,For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.
72821,72822,Othello,14.0,2.1.51,MONTANO,Is he well shipp'd?
72822,72823,Othello,15.0,2.1.52,CASSIO,"His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot"
72823,72824,Othello,15.0,2.1.53,CASSIO,"Of very expert and approved allowance,"
72824,72825,Othello,15.0,2.1.54,CASSIO,"Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,"
72825,72826,Othello,15.0,2.1.55,CASSIO,Stand in bold cure.
72826,72827,Othello,15.0,2.1.55,CASSIO,"A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'"

72834,72835,Othello,19.0,2.1.61,Second Gentlemen,Our friends at least.
72835,72836,Othello,20.0,2.1.62,CASSIO,"I pray you, sir, go forth,"
72836,72837,Othello,20.0,2.1.63,CASSIO,And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

72842,72843,Othello,23.0,2.1.68,CASSIO,"One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,"
72843,72844,Othello,23.0,2.1.69,CASSIO,And in the essential vesture of creation
72844,72845,Othello,23.0,2.1.70,CASSIO,Does tire the ingener.

72856,72857,Othello,27.0,2.1.81,CASSIO,"She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,"
72857,72858,Othello,27.0,2.1.82,CASSIO,"Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,"
72858,72859,Othello,27.0,2.1.83,CASSIO,Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts

73450,73451,Othello,84.0,2.3.293,CASSIO,"a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men"

73472,73473,Othello,90.0,2.3.315,CASSIO,"I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!"
73473,73474,Othello,91.0,2.3.316,IAGO,"You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man."
73474,73475,Othello,91.0,2.3.317,IAGO,I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
73475,73476,Othello,91.0,2.3.318,IAGO,"is now the general: may say so in this respect, for"
73476,73477,Othello,91.0,2.3.319,IAGO,that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
73477,73478,Othello,91.0,2.3.320,IAGO,"contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and"
73478,73479,Othello,91.0,2.3.321,IAGO,"graces: confess yourself freely to her, importune"
73479,73480,Othello,91.0,2.3.322,IAGO,her help to put you in your place again: she is of
73480,73481,Othello,91.0,2.3.323,IAGO,"so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,"
73481,73482,Othello,91.0,2.3.324,IAGO,she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
73482,73483,Othello,91.0,2.3.325,IAGO,than she is requested: this broken joint between
73483,73484,Othello,91.0,2.3.326,IAGO,"you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my"
73484,73485,Othello,91.0,2.3.327,IAGO,"fortunes against any lay worth naming, this"
73485,73486,Othello,91.0,2.3.328,IAGO,crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
73486,73487,Othello,92.0,2.3.329,CASSIO,You advise me well.
73487,73488,Othello,93.0,2.3.330,IAGO,"I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness."
73488,73489,Othello,94.0,2.3.331,CASSIO,"I think it freely, and betimes in the morning I will"
73489,73490,Othello,94.0,2.3.332,CASSIO,beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
73490,73491,Othello,94.0,2.3.333,CASSIO,I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.
73491,73492,Othello,95.0,2.3.334,IAGO,"You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I"
73492,73493,Othello,95.0,2.3.335,IAGO,must to the watch.
73493,73494,Othello,95.0,2.3.336,IAGO,"CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago."
73494,73495,Othello,95.0,,IAGO,Exit
73495,73496,Othello,96.0,2.3.337,IAGO,And what's he then that says I play the villain?
73496,73497,Othello,96.0,2.3.338,IAGO,"When this advice is free I give and honest,"
73497,73498,Othello,96.0,2.3.339,IAGO,Probal to thinking and indeed the course
73498,73499,Othello,96.0,2.3.340,IAGO,To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
73499,73500,Othello,96.0,2.3.341,IAGO,The inclining Desdemona to subdue
73500,73501,Othello,96.0,2.3.342,IAGO,In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
73501,73502,Othello,96.0,2.3.343,IAGO,As the free elements. And then for her
73502,73503,Othello,96.0,2.3.344,IAGO,"To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,"
73503,73504,Othello,96.0,2.3.345,IAGO,"All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,"
73504,73505,Othello,96.0,2.3.346,IAGO,"His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,"
73505,73506,Othello,96.0,2.3.347,IAGO,"That she may make, unmake, do what she list,"
73506,73507,Othello,96.0,2.3.348,IAGO,Even as her appetite shall play the god
73507,73508,Othello,96.0,2.3.349,IAGO,With his weak function. How am I then a villain
73508,73509,Othello,96.0,2.3.350,IAGO,"To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,"
73509,73510,Othello,96.0,2.3.351,IAGO,Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
73510,73511,Othello,96.0,2.3.352,IAGO,"When devils will the blackest sins put on,"
73511,73512,Othello,96.0,2.3.353,IAGO,"They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,"
73512,73513,Othello,96.0,2.3.354,IAGO,As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
73513,73514,Othello,96.0,2.3.355,IAGO,Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
73514,73515,Othello,96.0,2.3.356,IAGO,"And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,"
73515,73516,Othello,96.0,2.3.357,IAGO,"I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,"
73516,73517,Othello,96.0,2.3.358,IAGO,"That she repeals him for her body's lust,"
73517,73518,Othello,96.0,2.3.359,IAGO,"And by how much she strives to do him good,"
73518,73519,Othello,96.0,2.3.360,IAGO,She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
73519,73520,Othello,96.0,2.3.361,IAGO,"So will I turn her virtue into pitch,"
73520,73521,Othello,96.0,2.3.362,IAGO,And out of her own goodness make the net
73521,73522,Othello,96.0,2.3.363,IAGO,That shall enmesh them all.
73522,73523,Othello,96.0,,IAGO,Re-enter RODERIGO
73523,73524,Othello,96.0,2.3.364,IAGO,"How now, Roderigo!"
73524,73525,Othello,97.0,2.3.365,RODERIGO,"I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that"
73525,73526,Othello,97.0,2.3.366,RODERIGO,"hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is"
73526,73527,Othello,97.0,2.3.367,RODERIGO,"almost spent, I have been to-night exceedingly well"
73527,73528,Othello,97.0,2.3.368,RODERIGO,"cudgelled, and I think the issue will be, I shall"
73528,73529,Othello,97.0,2.3.369,RODERIGO,"have so much experience for my pains, and so, with"
73529,73530,Othello,97.0,2.3.370,RODERIGO,"no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice."
73530,73531,Othello,98.0,2.3.371,IAGO,How poor are they that have not patience!
73531,73532,Othello,98.0,2.3.372,IAGO,What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
73532,73533,Othello,98.0,2.3.373,IAGO,"Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,"
73533,73534,Othello,98.0,2.3.374,IAGO,And wit depends on dilatory time.
73534,73535,Othello,98.0,2.3.375,IAGO,Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
73535,73536,Othello,98.0,2.3.376,IAGO,"And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:"
73536,73537,Othello,98.0,2.3.377,IAGO,"Though other things grow fair against the sun,"
73537,73538,Othello,98.0,2.3.378,IAGO,Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
73538,73539,Othello,98.0,2.3.379,IAGO,"Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning,"
73539,73540,Othello,98.0,2.3.380,IAGO,Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
73540,73541,Othello,98.0,2.3.381,IAGO,"Retire thee, go where thou art billeted:"
73541,73542,Othello,98.0,2.3.382,IAGO,"Away, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter:"
73542,73543,Othello,98.0,2.3.383,IAGO,"Nay, get thee gone."
73543,73544,Othello,98.0,,IAGO,Exit RODERIGO
73544,73545,Othello,98.0,2.3.384,IAGO,Two things are to be done:
73545,73546,Othello,98.0,2.3.385,IAGO,"My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress,"
73546,73547,Othello,98.0,2.3.386,IAGO,"I'll set her on,"
73547,73548,Othello,98.0,2.3.387,IAGO,"Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,"
73548,73549,Othello,98.0,2.3.388,IAGO,And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
73549,73550,Othello,98.0,2.3.389,IAGO,"Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way"
73550,73551,Othello,98.0,2.3.390,IAGO,Dull not device by coldness and delay.
73551,73552,Othello,98.0,,IAGO,Exit

73560,73561,Othello,2.0,3.1.4,Clown,that they speak i' the nose thus?
73561,73562,Othello,3.0,3.1.5,First Musician,"How, sir, how!"
73562,73563,Othello,4.0,3.1.6,Clown,"Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?"
73563,73564,Othello,5.0,3.1.7,First Musician,"Ay, marry, are they, sir."
73564,73565,Othello,6.0,3.1.8,Clown,"O, thereby hangs a tail."
73565,73566,Othello,7.0,3.1.9,First Musician,"Whereby hangs a tale, sir?"
73566,73567,Othello,8.0,3.1.10,Clown,"Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know."
73567,73568,Othello,8.0,3.1.11,Clown,"But, masters, here's money for you: and the general"

73569,73570,Othello,8.0,3.1.13,Clown,"sake, to make no more noise with it."
73570,73571,Othello,9.0,3.1.14,First Musician,"Well, sir, we will not."

73573,73574,Othello,10.0,3.1.17,Clown,does not greatly care.
73574,73575,Othello,11.0,3.1.18,First Musician,"We have none such, sir."
73575,73576,Othello,12.0,3.1.19,Clown,"Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:"

73581,73582,Othello,15.0,3.1.24,CASSIO,of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends

73583,73584,Othello,15.0,3.1.26,CASSIO,one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
73584,73585,Othello,15.0,3.1.27,CASSIO,wilt thou do this?
73585,73586,Othello,16.0,3.1.28,Clown,"She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I"
73586,73587,Othello,16.0,3.1.29,Clown,shall seem to notify unto her.

73593,73594,Othello,19.0,3.1.34,CASSIO,"Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,"
73594,73595,Othello,19.0,3.1.35,CASSIO,To send in to your wife: my suit to her
73595,73596,Othello,19.0,3.1.36,CASSIO,"Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona"
73596,73597,Othello,19.0,3.1.37,CASSIO,Procure me some access.
73597,73598,Othello,20.0,3.1.38,IAGO,"I'll send her to you presently,"

73608,73609,Othello,22.0,3.1.47,EMILIA,"The general and his wife are talking of it,"
73609,73610,Othello,22.0,3.1.48,EMILIA,"And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,"
73610,73611,Othello,22.0,3.1.49,EMILIA,"That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,"
73611,73612,Othello,22.0,3.1.50,EMILIA,"And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom"
73612,73613,Othello,22.0,3.1.51,EMILIA,"He might not but refuse you, but he protests he loves you"

73642,73643,Othello,3.0,3.3.6,DESDEMONA,But I will have my lord and you again

73663,73664,Othello,7.0,3.3.27,DESDEMONA,I'll intermingle every thing he does
73664,73665,Othello,7.0,3.3.28,DESDEMONA,"With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio,"
73665,73666,Othello,7.0,3.3.29,DESDEMONA,For thy solicitor shall rather die
73666,73667,Othello,7.0,3.3.30,DESDEMONA,Than give thy cause away.
73667,73668,Othello,8.0,3.3.31,EMILIA,"Madam, here comes my lord."
73668,73669,Othello,9.0,3.3.32,CASSIO,"Madam, I'll take my leave."
73669,73670,Othello,10.0,3.3.33,DESDEMONA,"Why, stay, and hear me speak."
73670,73671,Othello,11.0,3.3.34,CASSIO,"Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,"
73671,73672,Othello,11.0,3.3.35,CASSIO,Unfit for mine own purposes.
73672,73673,Othello,12.0,3.3.36,DESDEMONA,"Well, do your discretion."
73673,73674,Othello,12.0,,DESDEMONA,Exit CASSIO
73674,73675,Othello,12.0,,DESDEMONA,Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
73675,73676,Othello,13.0,3.3.37,IAGO,Ha! I like not that.
73676,73677,Othello,14.0,3.3.38,OTHELLO,What dost thou say?
73677,73678,Othello,15.0,3.3.39,IAGO,"Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what."
73678,73679,Othello,16.0,3.3.40,OTHELLO,Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
73679,73680,Othello,17.0,3.3.41,IAGO,"Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,"
73680,73681,Othello,17.0,3.3.42,IAGO,"That he would steal away so guilty-like,"
73681,73682,Othello,17.0,3.3.43,IAGO,Seeing you coming.
73682,73683,Othello,18.0,3.3.44,OTHELLO,I do believe 'twas he.
73683,73684,Othello,19.0,3.3.45,DESDEMONA,"How now, my lord!"
73684,73685,Othello,19.0,3.3.46,DESDEMONA,"I have been talking with a suitor here,"
73685,73686,Othello,19.0,3.3.47,DESDEMONA,A man that languishes in your displeasure.
73686,73687,Othello,20.0,3.3.48,OTHELLO,Who is't you mean?
73687,73688,Othello,21.0,3.3.49,DESDEMONA,"Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,"
73688,73689,Othello,21.0,3.3.50,DESDEMONA,"If I have any grace or power to move you,"
73689,73690,Othello,21.0,3.3.51,DESDEMONA,"His present reconciliation take,"
73690,73691,Othello,21.0,3.3.52,DESDEMONA,"For if he be not one that truly loves you,"
73691,73692,Othello,21.0,3.3.53,DESDEMONA,"That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,"
73692,73693,Othello,21.0,3.3.54,DESDEMONA,I have no judgment in an honest face:
73693,73694,Othello,21.0,3.3.55,DESDEMONA,"I prithee, call him back."
73694,73695,Othello,22.0,3.3.56,OTHELLO,Went he hence now?
73695,73696,Othello,23.0,3.3.57,DESDEMONA,"Ay, sooth, so humbled"
73696,73697,Othello,23.0,3.3.58,DESDEMONA,"That he hath left part of his grief with me,"
73697,73698,Othello,23.0,3.3.59,DESDEMONA,"To suffer with him. Good love, call him back."
73698,73699,Othello,24.0,3.3.60,OTHELLO,"Not now, sweet Desdemona, some other time."
73699,73700,Othello,25.0,3.3.61,DESDEMONA,But shall't be shortly?
73700,73701,Othello,26.0,3.3.62,OTHELLO,"The sooner, sweet, for you."
73701,73702,Othello,27.0,3.3.63,DESDEMONA,Shall't be to-night at supper?
73702,73703,Othello,28.0,3.3.64,OTHELLO,"No, not to-night."
73703,73704,Othello,29.0,3.3.65,DESDEMONA,"To-morrow dinner, then?"
73704,73705,Othello,30.0,3.3.66,OTHELLO,"I shall not dine at home,"
73705,73706,Othello,30.0,3.3.67,OTHELLO,I meet the captains at the citadel.
73706,73707,Othello,31.0,3.3.68,DESDEMONA,"Why, then, to-morrow night, or Tuesday morn,"
73707,73708,Othello,31.0,3.3.69,DESDEMONA,"On Tuesday noon, or night, on Wednesday morn:"
73708,73709,Othello,31.0,3.3.70,DESDEMONA,"I prithee, name the time, but let it not"
73709,73710,Othello,31.0,3.3.71,DESDEMONA,"Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent,"
73710,73711,Othello,31.0,3.3.72,DESDEMONA,"And yet his trespass, in our common reason--"
73711,73712,Othello,31.0,3.3.73,DESDEMONA,"Save that, they say, the wars must make examples"
73712,73713,Othello,31.0,3.3.74,DESDEMONA,Out of their best--is not almost a fault
73713,73714,Othello,31.0,3.3.75,DESDEMONA,To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
73714,73715,Othello,31.0,3.3.76,DESDEMONA,"Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,"
73715,73716,Othello,31.0,3.3.77,DESDEMONA,"What you would ask me, that I should deny,"
73716,73717,Othello,31.0,3.3.78,DESDEMONA,"Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,"
73717,73718,Othello,31.0,3.3.79,DESDEMONA,"That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,"
73718,73719,Othello,31.0,3.3.80,DESDEMONA,"When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,"
73719,73720,Othello,31.0,3.3.81,DESDEMONA,"Hath ta'en your part, to have so much to do"
73720,73721,Othello,31.0,3.3.82,DESDEMONA,"To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--"
73721,73722,Othello,32.0,3.3.83,OTHELLO,"Prithee, no more: let him come when he will,"
73722,73723,Othello,32.0,3.3.84,OTHELLO,I will deny thee nothing.
73723,73724,Othello,33.0,3.3.85,DESDEMONA,"Why, this is not a boon,"
73724,73725,Othello,33.0,3.3.86,DESDEMONA,"'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,"
73725,73726,Othello,33.0,3.3.87,DESDEMONA,"Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,"
73726,73727,Othello,33.0,3.3.88,DESDEMONA,Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
73727,73728,Othello,33.0,3.3.89,DESDEMONA,"To your own person: nay, when I have a suit"
73728,73729,Othello,33.0,3.3.90,DESDEMONA,"Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,"
73729,73730,Othello,33.0,3.3.91,DESDEMONA,It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
73730,73731,Othello,33.0,3.3.92,DESDEMONA,And fearful to be granted.
73731,73732,Othello,34.0,3.3.93,OTHELLO,I will deny thee nothing:
73732,73733,Othello,34.0,3.3.94,OTHELLO,"Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,"
73733,73734,Othello,34.0,3.3.95,OTHELLO,To leave me but a little to myself.
73734,73735,Othello,35.0,3.3.96,DESDEMONA,"Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord."
73735,73736,Othello,36.0,3.3.97,OTHELLO,"Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight."
73736,73737,Othello,37.0,3.3.98,DESDEMONA,"Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you,"
73737,73738,Othello,37.0,3.3.99,DESDEMONA,"Whate'er you be, I am obedient."
73738,73739,Othello,37.0,,DESDEMONA,Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
73739,73740,Othello,38.0,3.3.100,OTHELLO,"Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,"
73740,73741,Othello,38.0,3.3.101,OTHELLO,"But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,"
73741,73742,Othello,38.0,3.3.102,OTHELLO,Chaos is come again.
73742,73743,Othello,39.0,3.3.103,IAGO,My noble lord--
73743,73744,Othello,40.0,3.3.104,OTHELLO,"What dost thou say, Iago?"
73744,73745,Othello,41.0,3.3.105,IAGO,"Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,"
73745,73746,Othello,41.0,3.3.106,IAGO,Know of your love?
73746,73747,Othello,42.0,3.3.107,OTHELLO,"He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?"
73747,73748,Othello,43.0,3.3.108,IAGO,"But for a satisfaction of my thought,"
73748,73749,Othello,43.0,3.3.109,IAGO,No further harm.
73749,73750,Othello,44.0,3.3.110,OTHELLO,"Why of thy thought, Iago?"
73750,73751,Othello,45.0,3.3.111,IAGO,I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
73751,73752,Othello,46.0,3.3.112,OTHELLO,"O, yes, and went between us very oft."
73752,73753,Othello,47.0,3.3.113,IAGO,Indeed!
73753,73754,Othello,48.0,3.3.114,OTHELLO,"Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?"
73754,73755,Othello,48.0,3.3.115,OTHELLO,Is he not honest?
73755,73756,Othello,49.0,3.3.116,IAGO,"Honest, my lord!"
73756,73757,Othello,50.0,3.3.117,OTHELLO,"Honest! ay, honest."
73757,73758,Othello,51.0,3.3.118,IAGO,"My lord, for aught I know."
73758,73759,Othello,52.0,3.3.119,OTHELLO,What dost thou think?
73759,73760,Othello,53.0,3.3.120,IAGO,"Think, my lord!"
73760,73761,Othello,54.0,3.3.121,OTHELLO,"Think, my lord!"
73761,73762,Othello,54.0,3.3.122,OTHELLO,"By heaven, he echoes me,"
73762,73763,Othello,54.0,3.3.123,OTHELLO,As if there were some monster in his thought
73763,73764,Othello,54.0,3.3.124,OTHELLO,Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
73764,73765,Othello,54.0,3.3.125,OTHELLO,"I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,"
73765,73766,Othello,54.0,3.3.126,OTHELLO,When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
73766,73767,Othello,54.0,3.3.127,OTHELLO,And when I told thee he was of my counsel
73767,73768,Othello,54.0,3.3.128,OTHELLO,"In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'"
73768,73769,Othello,54.0,3.3.129,OTHELLO,"And didst contract and purse thy brow together,"
73769,73770,Othello,54.0,3.3.130,OTHELLO,As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
73770,73771,Othello,54.0,3.3.131,OTHELLO,"Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,"
73771,73772,Othello,54.0,3.3.132,OTHELLO,Show me thy thought.
73772,73773,Othello,55.0,3.3.133,IAGO,"My lord, you know I love you."
73773,73774,Othello,56.0,3.3.134,OTHELLO,"I think thou dost,"
73774,73775,Othello,56.0,3.3.135,OTHELLO,"And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,"
73775,73776,Othello,56.0,3.3.136,OTHELLO,"And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,"
73776,73777,Othello,56.0,3.3.137,OTHELLO,Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
73777,73778,Othello,56.0,3.3.138,OTHELLO,For such things in a false disloyal knave
73778,73779,Othello,56.0,3.3.139,OTHELLO,"Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just"
73779,73780,Othello,56.0,3.3.140,OTHELLO,"They are close delations, working from the heart"
73780,73781,Othello,56.0,3.3.141,OTHELLO,That passion cannot rule.
73781,73782,Othello,57.0,3.3.142,IAGO,"For Michael Cassio,"
73782,73783,Othello,57.0,3.3.143,IAGO,I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
73783,73784,Othello,58.0,3.3.144,OTHELLO,I think so too.
73784,73785,Othello,59.0,3.3.145,IAGO,"Men should be what they seem,"
73785,73786,Othello,59.0,3.3.146,IAGO,"Or those that be not, would they might seem none!"
73786,73787,Othello,60.0,3.3.147,OTHELLO,"Certain, men should be what they seem."
73787,73788,Othello,61.0,3.3.148,IAGO,"Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man."
73788,73789,Othello,62.0,3.3.149,OTHELLO,"Nay, yet there's more in this:"
73789,73790,Othello,62.0,3.3.150,OTHELLO,"I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,"
73790,73791,Othello,62.0,3.3.151,OTHELLO,"As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts"
73791,73792,Othello,62.0,3.3.152,OTHELLO,The worst of words.
73792,73793,Othello,63.0,3.3.153,IAGO,"Good my lord, pardon me:"
73793,73794,Othello,63.0,3.3.154,IAGO,"Though I am bound to every act of duty,"
73794,73795,Othello,63.0,3.3.155,IAGO,I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
73795,73796,Othello,63.0,3.3.156,IAGO,"Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false,"
73796,73797,Othello,63.0,3.3.157,IAGO,As where's that palace whereinto foul things
73797,73798,Othello,63.0,3.3.158,IAGO,"Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,"
73798,73799,Othello,63.0,3.3.159,IAGO,But some uncleanly apprehensions
73799,73800,Othello,63.0,3.3.160,IAGO,Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
73800,73801,Othello,63.0,3.3.161,IAGO,With meditations lawful?
73801,73802,Othello,64.0,3.3.162,OTHELLO,"Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,"
73802,73803,Othello,64.0,3.3.163,OTHELLO,If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
73803,73804,Othello,64.0,3.3.164,OTHELLO,A stranger to thy thoughts.
73804,73805,Othello,65.0,3.3.165,IAGO,I do beseech you--
73805,73806,Othello,65.0,3.3.166,IAGO,"Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,"
73806,73807,Othello,65.0,3.3.167,IAGO,"As, I confess, it is my nature's plague"
73807,73808,Othello,65.0,3.3.168,IAGO,"To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy"
73808,73809,Othello,65.0,3.3.169,IAGO,"Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,"
73809,73810,Othello,65.0,3.3.170,IAGO,"From one that so imperfectly conceits,"
73810,73811,Othello,65.0,3.3.171,IAGO,"Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble"
73811,73812,Othello,65.0,3.3.172,IAGO,Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
73812,73813,Othello,65.0,3.3.173,IAGO,"It were not for your quiet nor your good,"
73813,73814,Othello,65.0,3.3.174,IAGO,"Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,"
73814,73815,Othello,65.0,3.3.175,IAGO,To let you know my thoughts.
73815,73816,Othello,66.0,3.3.176,OTHELLO,What dost thou mean?
73816,73817,Othello,67.0,3.3.177,IAGO,"Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,"
73817,73818,Othello,67.0,3.3.178,IAGO,Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
73818,73819,Othello,67.0,3.3.179,IAGO,"Who steals my purse steals trash, 'tis something, nothing,"
73819,73820,Othello,67.0,3.3.180,IAGO,"'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:"
73820,73821,Othello,67.0,3.3.181,IAGO,But he that filches from me my good name
73821,73822,Othello,67.0,3.3.182,IAGO,Robs me of that which not enriches him
73822,73823,Othello,67.0,3.3.183,IAGO,And makes me poor indeed.
73823,73824,Othello,68.0,3.3.184,OTHELLO,"By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts."
73824,73825,Othello,69.0,3.3.185,IAGO,"You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,"
73825,73826,Othello,69.0,3.3.186,IAGO,"Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody."
73826,73827,Othello,70.0,3.3.187,OTHELLO,Ha!
73827,73828,Othello,71.0,3.3.188,IAGO,"O, beware, my lord, of jealousy,"
73828,73829,Othello,71.0,3.3.189,IAGO,It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
73829,73830,Othello,71.0,3.3.190,IAGO,"The meat it feeds on, that cuckold lives in bliss"
73830,73831,Othello,71.0,3.3.191,IAGO,"Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger,"
73831,73832,Othello,71.0,3.3.192,IAGO,"But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er"
73832,73833,Othello,71.0,3.3.193,IAGO,"Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!"
73833,73834,Othello,72.0,3.3.194,OTHELLO,O misery!
73834,73835,Othello,73.0,3.3.195,IAGO,"Poor and content is rich and rich enough,"
73835,73836,Othello,73.0,3.3.196,IAGO,But riches fineless is as poor as winter
73836,73837,Othello,73.0,3.3.197,IAGO,To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
73837,73838,Othello,73.0,3.3.198,IAGO,"Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend"
73838,73839,Othello,73.0,3.3.199,IAGO,From jealousy!
73839,73840,Othello,74.0,3.3.200,OTHELLO,"Why, why is this?"
73840,73841,Othello,74.0,3.3.201,OTHELLO,"Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,"
73841,73842,Othello,74.0,3.3.202,OTHELLO,To follow still the changes of the moon
73842,73843,Othello,74.0,3.3.203,OTHELLO,"With fresh suspicions? No, to be once in doubt"
73843,73844,Othello,74.0,3.3.204,OTHELLO,"Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,"
73844,73845,Othello,74.0,3.3.205,OTHELLO,When I shall turn the business of my soul

74029,74030,Othello,124.0,3.3.383,OTHELLO,I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
74030,74031,Othello,124.0,3.3.384,OTHELLO,"He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,"
74031,74032,Othello,124.0,3.3.385,OTHELLO,"Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all."
74032,74033,Othello,125.0,3.3.386,IAGO,I am sorry to hear this.
74033,74034,Othello,126.0,3.3.387,OTHELLO,"I had been happy, if the general camp,"
74034,74035,Othello,126.0,3.3.388,OTHELLO,"Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,"
74035,74036,Othello,126.0,3.3.389,OTHELLO,"So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever"
74036,74037,Othello,126.0,3.3.390,OTHELLO,Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
74037,74038,Othello,126.0,3.3.391,OTHELLO,"Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,"
74038,74039,Othello,126.0,3.3.392,OTHELLO,"That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!"
74039,74040,Othello,126.0,3.3.393,OTHELLO,"Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,"
74040,74041,Othello,126.0,3.3.394,OTHELLO,"The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,"
74041,74042,Othello,126.0,3.3.395,OTHELLO,"The royal banner, and all quality,"
74042,74043,Othello,126.0,3.3.396,OTHELLO,"Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!"
74043,74044,Othello,126.0,3.3.397,OTHELLO,"And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats"
74044,74045,Othello,126.0,3.3.398,OTHELLO,"The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,"
74045,74046,Othello,126.0,3.3.399,OTHELLO,Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
74046,74047,Othello,127.0,3.3.400,IAGO,"Is't possible, my lord?"
74047,74048,Othello,128.0,3.3.401,OTHELLO,"Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,"
74048,74049,Othello,128.0,3.3.402,OTHELLO,"Be sure of it, give me the ocular proof:"
74049,74050,Othello,128.0,3.3.403,OTHELLO,"Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,"
74050,74051,Othello,128.0,3.3.404,OTHELLO,Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
74051,74052,Othello,128.0,3.3.405,OTHELLO,Than answer my waked wrath!
74052,74053,Othello,129.0,3.3.406,IAGO,Is't come to this?
74053,74054,Othello,130.0,3.3.407,OTHELLO,"Make me to see't, or, at the least, so prove it,"
74054,74055,Othello,130.0,3.3.408,OTHELLO,That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
74055,74056,Othello,130.0,3.3.409,OTHELLO,"To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!"
74056,74057,Othello,131.0,3.3.410,IAGO,"My noble lord,--"
74057,74058,Othello,132.0,3.3.411,OTHELLO,"If thou dost slander her and torture me,"
74058,74059,Othello,132.0,3.3.412,OTHELLO,"Never pray more, abandon all remorse,"
74059,74060,Othello,132.0,3.3.413,OTHELLO,"On horror's head horrors accumulate,"
74060,74061,Othello,132.0,3.3.414,OTHELLO,"Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed,"
74061,74062,Othello,132.0,3.3.415,OTHELLO,For nothing canst thou to damnation add
74062,74063,Othello,132.0,3.3.416,OTHELLO,Greater than that.
74063,74064,Othello,133.0,3.3.417,IAGO,O grace! O heaven forgive me!
74064,74065,Othello,133.0,3.3.418,IAGO,Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
74065,74066,Othello,133.0,3.3.419,IAGO,"God be wi' you, take mine office. O wretched fool."
74066,74067,Othello,133.0,3.3.420,IAGO,That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
74067,74068,Othello,133.0,3.3.421,IAGO,"O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,"
74068,74069,Othello,133.0,3.3.422,IAGO,To be direct and honest is not safe.
74069,74070,Othello,133.0,3.3.423,IAGO,"I thank you for this profit, and from hence"
74070,74071,Othello,133.0,3.3.424,IAGO,"I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence."
74071,74072,Othello,134.0,3.3.425,OTHELLO,"Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest."
74072,74073,Othello,135.0,3.3.426,IAGO,"I should be wise, for honesty's a fool"
74073,74074,Othello,135.0,3.3.427,IAGO,And loses that it works for.
74074,74075,Othello,136.0,3.3.428,OTHELLO,"By the world,"
74075,74076,Othello,136.0,3.3.429,OTHELLO,"I think my wife be honest and think she is not,"
74076,74077,Othello,136.0,3.3.430,OTHELLO,I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
74077,74078,Othello,136.0,3.3.431,OTHELLO,"I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh"
74078,74079,Othello,136.0,3.3.432,OTHELLO,"As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black"
74079,74080,Othello,136.0,3.3.433,OTHELLO,"As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,"
74080,74081,Othello,136.0,3.3.434,OTHELLO,"Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,"
74081,74082,Othello,136.0,3.3.435,OTHELLO,I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
74082,74083,Othello,137.0,3.3.436,IAGO,"I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:"
74083,74084,Othello,137.0,3.3.437,IAGO,I do repent me that I put it to you.
74084,74085,Othello,137.0,3.3.438,IAGO,You would be satisfied?
74085,74086,Othello,138.0,3.3.439,OTHELLO,"Would! nay, I will."
74086,74087,Othello,139.0,3.3.440,IAGO,"And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?"
74087,74088,Othello,139.0,3.3.441,IAGO,"Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--"
74088,74089,Othello,139.0,3.3.442,IAGO,Behold her topp'd?
74089,74090,Othello,140.0,3.3.443,OTHELLO,Death and damnation! O!
74090,74091,Othello,141.0,3.3.444,IAGO,"It were a tedious difficulty, I think,"
74091,74092,Othello,141.0,3.3.445,IAGO,"To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,"
74092,74093,Othello,141.0,3.3.446,IAGO,If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
74093,74094,Othello,141.0,3.3.447,IAGO,More than their own! What then? how then?
74094,74095,Othello,141.0,3.3.448,IAGO,What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
74095,74096,Othello,141.0,3.3.449,IAGO,"It is impossible you should see this,"
74096,74097,Othello,141.0,3.3.450,IAGO,"Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,"
74097,74098,Othello,141.0,3.3.451,IAGO,"As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross"
74098,74099,Othello,141.0,3.3.452,IAGO,"As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,"
74099,74100,Othello,141.0,3.3.453,IAGO,"If imputation and strong circumstances,"
74100,74101,Othello,141.0,3.3.454,IAGO,"Which lead directly to the door of truth,"
74101,74102,Othello,141.0,3.3.455,IAGO,"Will give you satisfaction, you may have't."
74102,74103,Othello,142.0,3.3.456,OTHELLO,Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
74103,74104,Othello,143.0,3.3.457,IAGO,I do not like the office:
74104,74105,Othello,143.0,3.3.458,IAGO,"But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,"
74105,74106,Othello,143.0,3.3.459,IAGO,"Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,"
74106,74107,Othello,143.0,3.3.460,IAGO,"I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,"
74107,74108,Othello,143.0,3.3.461,IAGO,"And, being troubled with a raging tooth,"
74108,74109,Othello,143.0,3.3.462,IAGO,I could not sleep.
74109,74110,Othello,143.0,3.3.463,IAGO,"There are a kind of men so loose of soul,"
74110,74111,Othello,143.0,3.3.464,IAGO,That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
74111,74112,Othello,143.0,3.3.465,IAGO,One of this kind is Cassio:
74112,74113,Othello,143.0,3.3.466,IAGO,"In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,"
74113,74114,Othello,143.0,3.3.467,IAGO,"Let us be wary, let us hide our loves,'"
74114,74115,Othello,143.0,3.3.468,IAGO,"And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,"
74115,74116,Othello,143.0,3.3.469,IAGO,"Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,"
74116,74117,Othello,143.0,3.3.470,IAGO,As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
74117,74118,Othello,143.0,3.3.471,IAGO,That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
74118,74119,Othello,143.0,3.3.472,IAGO,"Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd, and then"
74119,74120,Othello,143.0,3.3.473,IAGO,Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'
74120,74121,Othello,144.0,3.3.474,OTHELLO,O monstrous! monstrous!
74121,74122,Othello,145.0,3.3.475,IAGO,"Nay, this was but his dream."
74122,74123,Othello,146.0,3.3.476,OTHELLO,But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
74123,74124,Othello,146.0,3.3.477,OTHELLO,"'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream."
74124,74125,Othello,147.0,3.3.478,IAGO,And this may help to thicken other proofs
74125,74126,Othello,147.0,3.3.479,IAGO,That do demonstrate thinly.
74126,74127,Othello,148.0,3.3.480,OTHELLO,I'll tear her all to pieces.
74127,74128,Othello,149.0,3.3.481,IAGO,"Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done,"
74128,74129,Othello,149.0,3.3.482,IAGO,"She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,"
74129,74130,Othello,149.0,3.3.483,IAGO,Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
74130,74131,Othello,149.0,3.3.484,IAGO,Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
74131,74132,Othello,150.0,3.3.485,OTHELLO,"I gave her such a one, 'twas my first gift."
74132,74133,Othello,151.0,3.3.486,IAGO,"I know not that, but such a handkerchief--"
74133,74134,Othello,151.0,3.3.487,IAGO,I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
74134,74135,Othello,151.0,3.3.488,IAGO,See Cassio wipe his beard with.
74135,74136,Othello,152.0,3.3.489,OTHELLO,If it be that--
74136,74137,Othello,153.0,3.3.490,IAGO,"If it be that, or any that was hers,"
74137,74138,Othello,153.0,3.3.491,IAGO,It speaks against her with the other proofs.
74138,74139,Othello,154.0,3.3.492,OTHELLO,"O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!"
74139,74140,Othello,154.0,3.3.493,OTHELLO,"One is too poor, too weak for my revenge."
74140,74141,Othello,154.0,3.3.494,OTHELLO,"Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago,"
74141,74142,Othello,154.0,3.3.495,OTHELLO,All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
74142,74143,Othello,154.0,3.3.496,OTHELLO,'Tis gone.
74143,74144,Othello,154.0,3.3.497,OTHELLO,"Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!"
74144,74145,Othello,154.0,3.3.498,OTHELLO,"Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne"
74145,74146,Othello,154.0,3.3.499,OTHELLO,"To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,"
74146,74147,Othello,154.0,3.3.500,OTHELLO,For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
74147,74148,Othello,155.0,3.3.501,IAGO,Yet be content.
74148,74149,Othello,156.0,3.3.502,OTHELLO,"O, blood, blood, blood!"
74149,74150,Othello,157.0,3.3.503,IAGO,"Patience, I say, your mind perhaps may change."
74150,74151,Othello,158.0,3.3.504,OTHELLO,"Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,"
74151,74152,Othello,158.0,3.3.505,OTHELLO,Whose icy current and compulsive course
74152,74153,Othello,158.0,3.3.506,OTHELLO,"Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on"
74153,74154,Othello,158.0,3.3.507,OTHELLO,"To the Propontic and the Hellespont,"
74154,74155,Othello,158.0,3.3.508,OTHELLO,"Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,"
74155,74156,Othello,158.0,3.3.509,OTHELLO,"Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,"
74156,74157,Othello,158.0,3.3.510,OTHELLO,Till that a capable and wide revenge
74157,74158,Othello,158.0,3.3.511,OTHELLO,"Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,"
74158,74159,Othello,158.0,,OTHELLO,Kneels
74159,74160,Othello,158.0,3.3.512,OTHELLO,In the due reverence of a sacred vow
74160,74161,Othello,158.0,3.3.513,OTHELLO,I here engage my words.
74161,74162,Othello,159.0,3.3.514,IAGO,Do not rise yet.
74162,74163,Othello,159.0,,IAGO,Kneels

74164,74165,Othello,159.0,3.3.516,IAGO,"You elements that clip us round about,"
74165,74166,Othello,159.0,3.3.517,IAGO,Witness that here Iago doth give up
74166,74167,Othello,159.0,3.3.518,IAGO,"The execution of his wit, hands, heart,"
74167,74168,Othello,159.0,3.3.519,IAGO,"To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,"
74168,74169,Othello,159.0,3.3.520,IAGO,"And to obey shall be in me remorse,"
74169,74170,Othello,159.0,3.3.521,IAGO,What bloody business ever.
74170,74171,Othello,159.0,,IAGO,They rise
74171,74172,Othello,160.0,3.3.522,OTHELLO,"I greet thy love,"
74172,74173,Othello,160.0,3.3.523,OTHELLO,"Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,"
74173,74174,Othello,160.0,3.3.524,OTHELLO,And will upon the instant put thee to't:
74174,74175,Othello,160.0,3.3.525,OTHELLO,Within these three days let me hear thee say
74175,74176,Othello,160.0,3.3.526,OTHELLO,That Cassio's not alive.
74176,74177,Othello,161.0,3.3.527,IAGO,"My friend is dead, 'tis done at your request:"
74177,74178,Othello,161.0,3.3.528,IAGO,But let her live.
74178,74179,Othello,162.0,3.3.529,OTHELLO,"Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!"
74179,74180,Othello,162.0,3.3.530,OTHELLO,"Come, go with me apart, I will withdraw,"
74180,74181,Othello,162.0,3.3.531,OTHELLO,To furnish me with some swift means of death
74181,74182,Othello,162.0,3.3.532,OTHELLO,For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
74182,74183,Othello,163.0,3.3.533,IAGO,I am your own for ever.
74183,74184,Othello,163.0,,IAGO,Exeunt

74186,74187,Othello,1.0,3.4.1,DESDEMONA,"Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?"
74187,74188,Othello,2.0,3.4.2,Clown,I dare not say he lies any where.
74188,74189,Othello,3.0,3.4.3,DESDEMONA,"Why, man?"
74189,74190,Othello,4.0,3.4.4,Clown,"He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,"
74190,74191,Othello,4.0,3.4.5,Clown,is stabbing.
74191,74192,Othello,5.0,3.4.6,DESDEMONA,Go to: where lodges he?
74192,74193,Othello,6.0,3.4.7,Clown,"To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie."
74193,74194,Othello,7.0,3.4.8,DESDEMONA,Can any thing be made of this?
74194,74195,Othello,8.0,3.4.9,Clown,"I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a"
74195,74196,Othello,8.0,3.4.10,Clown,"lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were"
74196,74197,Othello,8.0,3.4.11,Clown,to lie in mine own throat.
74197,74198,Othello,9.0,3.4.12,DESDEMONA,"Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?"
74198,74199,Othello,10.0,3.4.13,Clown,"I will catechise the world for him, that is, make"
74199,74200,Othello,10.0,3.4.14,Clown,"questions, and by them answer."
74200,74201,Othello,11.0,3.4.15,DESDEMONA,"Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have"
74201,74202,Othello,11.0,3.4.16,DESDEMONA,"moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well."
74202,74203,Othello,12.0,3.4.17,Clown,To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
74203,74204,Othello,12.0,3.4.18,Clown,therefore I will attempt the doing it.
74204,74205,Othello,12.0,,Clown,Exit

74207,74208,Othello,15.0,3.4.21,DESDEMONA,"Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse"
74208,74209,Othello,15.0,3.4.22,DESDEMONA,"Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor"
74209,74210,Othello,15.0,3.4.23,DESDEMONA,Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
74210,74211,Othello,15.0,3.4.24,DESDEMONA,"As jealous creatures are, it were enough"
74211,74212,Othello,15.0,3.4.25,DESDEMONA,To put him to ill thinking.
74212,74213,Othello,16.0,3.4.26,EMILIA,Is he not jealous?
74213,74214,Othello,17.0,3.4.27,DESDEMONA,"Who, he? I think the sun where he was born"
74214,74215,Othello,17.0,3.4.28,DESDEMONA,Drew all such humours from him.
74215,74216,Othello,18.0,3.4.29,EMILIA,"Look, where he comes."
74216,74217,Othello,19.0,3.4.30,DESDEMONA,I will not leave him now till Cassio
74217,74218,Othello,19.0,3.4.31,DESDEMONA,Be call'd to him.
74218,74219,Othello,19.0,,DESDEMONA,Enter OTHELLO
74219,74220,Othello,19.0,3.4.32,DESDEMONA,"How is't with you, my lord"
74220,74221,Othello,20.0,3.4.33,OTHELLO,"Well, my good lady."
74221,74222,Othello,20.0,,OTHELLO,Aside
74222,74223,Othello,20.0,3.4.34,OTHELLO,"O, hardness to dissemble!--"
74223,74224,Othello,20.0,3.4.35,OTHELLO,"How do you, Desdemona?"
74224,74225,Othello,21.0,3.4.36,DESDEMONA,"Well, my good lord."
74225,74226,Othello,22.0,3.4.37,OTHELLO,"Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady."
74226,74227,Othello,23.0,3.4.38,DESDEMONA,It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
74227,74228,Othello,24.0,3.4.39,OTHELLO,This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
74228,74229,Othello,24.0,3.4.40,OTHELLO,"Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires"
74229,74230,Othello,24.0,3.4.41,OTHELLO,"A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,"
74230,74231,Othello,24.0,3.4.42,OTHELLO,"Much castigation, exercise devout,"
74231,74232,Othello,24.0,3.4.43,OTHELLO,"For here's a young and sweating devil here,"
74232,74233,Othello,24.0,3.4.44,OTHELLO,"That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,"
74233,74234,Othello,24.0,3.4.45,OTHELLO,A frank one.
74234,74235,Othello,25.0,3.4.46,DESDEMONA,"You may, indeed, say so,"
74235,74236,Othello,25.0,3.4.47,DESDEMONA,For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
74236,74237,Othello,26.0,3.4.48,OTHELLO,"A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands,"
74237,74238,Othello,26.0,3.4.49,OTHELLO,"But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts."
74238,74239,Othello,27.0,3.4.50,DESDEMONA,"I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise."
74239,74240,Othello,28.0,3.4.51,OTHELLO,"What promise, chuck?"
74240,74241,Othello,29.0,3.4.52,DESDEMONA,I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
74241,74242,Othello,30.0,3.4.53,OTHELLO,"I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me,"
74242,74243,Othello,30.0,3.4.54,OTHELLO,Lend me thy handkerchief.
74243,74244,Othello,31.0,3.4.55,DESDEMONA,"Here, my lord."
74244,74245,Othello,32.0,3.4.56,OTHELLO,That which I gave you.
74245,74246,Othello,33.0,3.4.57,DESDEMONA,I have it not about me.
74246,74247,Othello,34.0,3.4.58,OTHELLO,Not?
74247,74248,Othello,35.0,3.4.59,DESDEMONA,"No, indeed, my lord."
74248,74249,Othello,36.0,3.4.60,OTHELLO,That is a fault.
74249,74250,Othello,36.0,3.4.61,OTHELLO,That handkerchief
74250,74251,Othello,36.0,3.4.62,OTHELLO,"Did an Egyptian to my mother give,"
74251,74252,Othello,36.0,3.4.63,OTHELLO,"She was a charmer, and could almost read"
74252,74253,Othello,36.0,3.4.64,OTHELLO,"The thoughts of people: she told her, while"
74253,74254,Othello,36.0,3.4.65,OTHELLO,"she kept it,"
74254,74255,Othello,36.0,3.4.66,OTHELLO,'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father

74256,74257,Othello,36.0,3.4.68,OTHELLO,"Or made gift of it, my father's eye"
74257,74258,Othello,36.0,3.4.69,OTHELLO,Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
74258,74259,Othello,36.0,3.4.70,OTHELLO,"After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me,"
74259,74260,Othello,36.0,3.4.71,OTHELLO,"And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,"
74260,74261,Othello,36.0,3.4.72,OTHELLO,"To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't,"
74261,74262,Othello,36.0,3.4.73,OTHELLO,"Make it a darling like your precious eye,"
74262,74263,Othello,36.0,3.4.74,OTHELLO,To lose't or give't away were such perdition
74263,74264,Othello,36.0,3.4.75,OTHELLO,As nothing else could match.
74264,74265,Othello,37.0,3.4.76,DESDEMONA,Is't possible?
74265,74266,Othello,38.0,3.4.77,OTHELLO,'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
74266,74267,Othello,38.0,3.4.78,OTHELLO,"A sibyl, that had number'd in the world"
74267,74268,Othello,38.0,3.4.79,OTHELLO,"The sun to course two hundred compasses,"
74268,74269,Othello,38.0,3.4.80,OTHELLO,"In her prophetic fury sew'd the work,"
74269,74270,Othello,38.0,3.4.81,OTHELLO,"The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk,"
74270,74271,Othello,38.0,3.4.82,OTHELLO,And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
74271,74272,Othello,38.0,3.4.83,OTHELLO,Conserved of maidens' hearts.
74272,74273,Othello,39.0,3.4.84,DESDEMONA,Indeed! is't true?
74273,74274,Othello,40.0,3.4.85,OTHELLO,"Most veritable, therefore look to't well."
74274,74275,Othello,41.0,3.4.86,DESDEMONA,Then would to God that I had never seen't!
74275,74276,Othello,42.0,3.4.87,OTHELLO,Ha! wherefore?
74276,74277,Othello,43.0,3.4.88,DESDEMONA,Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
74277,74278,Othello,44.0,3.4.89,OTHELLO,"Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out"
74278,74279,Othello,44.0,3.4.90,OTHELLO,o' the way?
74279,74280,Othello,45.0,3.4.91,DESDEMONA,Heaven bless us!
74280,74281,Othello,46.0,3.4.92,OTHELLO,Say you?
74281,74282,Othello,47.0,3.4.93,DESDEMONA,"It is not lost, but what an if it were?"
74282,74283,Othello,48.0,3.4.94,OTHELLO,How!
74283,74284,Othello,49.0,3.4.95,DESDEMONA,"I say, it is not lost."
74284,74285,Othello,50.0,3.4.96,OTHELLO,"Fetch't, let me see't."
74285,74286,Othello,51.0,3.4.97,DESDEMONA,"Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now."
74286,74287,Othello,51.0,3.4.98,DESDEMONA,This is a trick to put me from my suit:
74287,74288,Othello,51.0,3.4.99,DESDEMONA,"Pray you, let Cassio be received again."
74288,74289,Othello,52.0,3.4.100,OTHELLO,Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.
74289,74290,Othello,53.0,3.4.101,DESDEMONA,"Come, come,"
74290,74291,Othello,53.0,3.4.102,DESDEMONA,You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
74291,74292,Othello,54.0,3.4.103,OTHELLO,The handkerchief!
74292,74293,Othello,55.0,3.4.104,DESDEMONA,"I pray, talk me of Cassio."
74293,74294,Othello,56.0,3.4.105,OTHELLO,The handkerchief!
74294,74295,Othello,57.0,3.4.106,DESDEMONA,A man that all his time
74295,74296,Othello,57.0,3.4.107,DESDEMONA,"Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,"
74296,74297,Othello,57.0,3.4.108,DESDEMONA,"Shared dangers with you,--"
74297,74298,Othello,58.0,3.4.109,OTHELLO,The handkerchief!
74298,74299,Othello,59.0,3.4.110,DESDEMONA,"In sooth, you are to blame."
74299,74300,Othello,60.0,3.4.111,OTHELLO,Away!
74300,74301,Othello,60.0,,OTHELLO,Exit
74301,74302,Othello,61.0,3.4.112,EMILIA,Is not this man jealous?
74302,74303,Othello,62.0,3.4.113,DESDEMONA,I ne'er saw this before.
74303,74304,Othello,62.0,3.4.114,DESDEMONA,"Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:"
74304,74305,Othello,62.0,3.4.115,DESDEMONA,I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
74305,74306,Othello,63.0,3.4.116,EMILIA,'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
74306,74307,Othello,63.0,3.4.117,EMILIA,"They are all but stomachs, and we all but food,"
74307,74308,Othello,63.0,3.4.118,EMILIA,"To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,"
74308,74309,Othello,63.0,3.4.119,EMILIA,"They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!"
74309,74310,Othello,63.0,,EMILIA,Enter CASSIO and IAGO
74310,74311,Othello,64.0,3.4.120,IAGO,"There is no other way, 'tis she must do't:"
74311,74312,Othello,64.0,3.4.121,IAGO,"And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her."
74312,74313,Othello,65.0,3.4.122,DESDEMONA,"How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?"
74313,74314,Othello,66.0,3.4.123,CASSIO,"Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you"
74314,74315,Othello,66.0,3.4.124,CASSIO,That by your virtuous means I may again
74315,74316,Othello,66.0,3.4.125,CASSIO,"Exist, and be a member of his love"
74316,74317,Othello,66.0,3.4.126,CASSIO,Whom I with all the office of my heart
74317,74318,Othello,66.0,3.4.127,CASSIO,Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
74318,74319,Othello,66.0,3.4.128,CASSIO,If my offence be of such mortal kind
74319,74320,Othello,66.0,3.4.129,CASSIO,"That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,"
74320,74321,Othello,66.0,3.4.130,CASSIO,"Nor purposed merit in futurity,"
74321,74322,Othello,66.0,3.4.131,CASSIO,"Can ransom me into his love again,"
74322,74323,Othello,66.0,3.4.132,CASSIO,"But to know so must be my benefit,"
74323,74324,Othello,66.0,3.4.133,CASSIO,"So shall I clothe me in a forced content,"
74324,74325,Othello,66.0,3.4.134,CASSIO,"And shut myself up in some other course,"
74325,74326,Othello,66.0,3.4.135,CASSIO,To fortune's alms.
74326,74327,Othello,67.0,3.4.136,DESDEMONA,"Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!"
74327,74328,Othello,67.0,3.4.137,DESDEMONA,"My advocation is not now in tune,"
74328,74329,Othello,67.0,3.4.138,DESDEMONA,"My lord is not my lord, nor should I know him,"
74329,74330,Othello,67.0,3.4.139,DESDEMONA,Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
74330,74331,Othello,67.0,3.4.140,DESDEMONA,"So help me every spirit sanctified,"
74331,74332,Othello,67.0,3.4.141,DESDEMONA,As I have spoken for you all my best
74332,74333,Othello,67.0,3.4.142,DESDEMONA,And stood within the blank of his displeasure
74333,74334,Othello,67.0,3.4.143,DESDEMONA,For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
74334,74335,Othello,67.0,3.4.144,DESDEMONA,"What I can do I will, and more I will"
74335,74336,Othello,67.0,3.4.145,DESDEMONA,Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
74336,74337,Othello,68.0,3.4.146,IAGO,Is my lord angry?
74337,74338,Othello,69.0,3.4.147,EMILIA,"He went hence but now,"
74338,74339,Othello,69.0,3.4.148,EMILIA,And certainly in strange unquietness.
74339,74340,Othello,70.0,3.4.149,IAGO,"Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,"
74340,74341,Othello,70.0,3.4.150,IAGO,"When it hath blown his ranks into the air,"
74341,74342,Othello,70.0,3.4.151,IAGO,"And, like the devil, from his very arm"
74342,74343,Othello,70.0,3.4.152,IAGO,Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
74343,74344,Othello,70.0,3.4.153,IAGO,Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
74344,74345,Othello,70.0,3.4.154,IAGO,"There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry."
74345,74346,Othello,71.0,3.4.155,DESDEMONA,"I prithee, do so."
74346,74347,Othello,71.0,,DESDEMONA,Exit IAGO
74347,74348,Othello,71.0,3.4.156,DESDEMONA,"Something, sure, of state,"
74348,74349,Othello,71.0,3.4.157,DESDEMONA,"Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise"
74349,74350,Othello,71.0,3.4.158,DESDEMONA,"Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,"
74350,74351,Othello,71.0,3.4.159,DESDEMONA,Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
74351,74352,Othello,71.0,3.4.160,DESDEMONA,"Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,"
74352,74353,Othello,71.0,3.4.161,DESDEMONA,"Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so,"
74353,74354,Othello,71.0,3.4.162,DESDEMONA,"For let our finger ache, and it indues"
74354,74355,Othello,71.0,3.4.163,DESDEMONA,Our other healthful members even to that sense
74355,74356,Othello,71.0,3.4.164,DESDEMONA,"Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,"
74356,74357,Othello,71.0,3.4.165,DESDEMONA,Nor of them look for such observances
74357,74358,Othello,71.0,3.4.166,DESDEMONA,"As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,"
74358,74359,Othello,71.0,3.4.167,DESDEMONA,"I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,"
74359,74360,Othello,71.0,3.4.168,DESDEMONA,"Arraigning his unkindness with my soul,"
74360,74361,Othello,71.0,3.4.169,DESDEMONA,"But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,"
74361,74362,Othello,71.0,3.4.170,DESDEMONA,And he's indicted falsely.
74362,74363,Othello,72.0,3.4.171,EMILIA,"Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,"
74363,74364,Othello,72.0,3.4.172,EMILIA,And no conception nor no jealous toy
74364,74365,Othello,72.0,3.4.173,EMILIA,Concerning you.
74365,74366,Othello,73.0,3.4.174,DESDEMONA,Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
74366,74367,Othello,74.0,3.4.175,EMILIA,"But jealous souls will not be answer'd so,"
74367,74368,Othello,74.0,3.4.176,EMILIA,"They are not ever jealous for the cause,"
74368,74369,Othello,74.0,3.4.177,EMILIA,But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
74369,74370,Othello,74.0,3.4.178,EMILIA,"Begot upon itself, born on itself."
74370,74371,Othello,75.0,3.4.179,DESDEMONA,Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
74371,74372,Othello,76.0,3.4.180,EMILIA,"Lady, amen."
74372,74373,Othello,77.0,3.4.181,DESDEMONA,"I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:"
74373,74374,Othello,77.0,3.4.182,DESDEMONA,"If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit"
74374,74375,Othello,77.0,3.4.183,DESDEMONA,And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
74375,74376,Othello,78.0,3.4.184,CASSIO,I humbly thank your ladyship.
74376,74377,Othello,78.0,,CASSIO,Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
74377,74378,Othello,78.0,,CASSIO,Enter BIANCA
74378,74379,Othello,79.0,3.4.185,BIANCA,"Save you, friend Cassio!"
74379,74380,Othello,80.0,3.4.186,CASSIO,What make you from home?
74380,74381,Othello,80.0,3.4.187,CASSIO,"How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?"
74381,74382,Othello,80.0,3.4.188,CASSIO,"I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house."
74382,74383,Othello,81.0,3.4.189,BIANCA,"And I was going to your lodging, Cassio."
74383,74384,Othello,81.0,3.4.190,BIANCA,"What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?"
74384,74385,Othello,81.0,3.4.191,BIANCA,"Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,"
74385,74386,Othello,81.0,3.4.192,BIANCA,More tedious than the dial eight score times?
74386,74387,Othello,81.0,3.4.193,BIANCA,O weary reckoning!
74387,74388,Othello,82.0,3.4.194,CASSIO,"Pardon me, Bianca:"
74388,74389,Othello,82.0,3.4.195,CASSIO,I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
74389,74390,Othello,82.0,3.4.196,CASSIO,"But I shall, in a more continuate time,"
74390,74391,Othello,82.0,3.4.197,CASSIO,"Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,"
74391,74392,Othello,82.0,,CASSIO,Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief
74392,74393,Othello,82.0,3.4.198,CASSIO,Take me this work out.
74393,74394,Othello,83.0,3.4.199,BIANCA,"O Cassio, whence came this?"
74394,74395,Othello,83.0,3.4.200,BIANCA,This is some token from a newer friend:
74395,74396,Othello,83.0,3.4.201,BIANCA,To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
74396,74397,Othello,83.0,3.4.202,BIANCA,"Is't come to this? Well, well."
74397,74398,Othello,84.0,3.4.203,CASSIO,"Go to, woman!"
74398,74399,Othello,84.0,3.4.204,CASSIO,"Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,"
74399,74400,Othello,84.0,3.4.205,CASSIO,From whence you have them. You are jealous now
74400,74401,Othello,84.0,3.4.206,CASSIO,"That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:"
74401,74402,Othello,84.0,3.4.207,CASSIO,"No, in good troth, Bianca."
74402,74403,Othello,85.0,3.4.208,BIANCA,"Why, whose is it?"
74403,74404,Othello,86.0,3.4.209,CASSIO,"I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber."
74404,74405,Othello,86.0,3.4.210,CASSIO,I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
74405,74406,Othello,86.0,3.4.211,CASSIO,As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
74406,74407,Othello,86.0,3.4.212,CASSIO,"Take it, and do't, and leave me for this time."
74407,74408,Othello,87.0,3.4.213,BIANCA,Leave you! wherefore?
74408,74409,Othello,88.0,3.4.214,CASSIO,"I do attend here on the general,"
74409,74410,Othello,88.0,3.4.215,CASSIO,"And think it no addition, nor my wish,"
74410,74411,Othello,88.0,3.4.216,CASSIO,To have him see me woman'd.
74411,74412,Othello,89.0,3.4.217,BIANCA,"Why, I pray you?"
74412,74413,Othello,90.0,3.4.218,CASSIO,Not that I love you not.
74413,74414,Othello,91.0,3.4.219,BIANCA,But that you do not love me.
74414,74415,Othello,91.0,3.4.220,BIANCA,"I pray you, bring me on the way a little,"
74415,74416,Othello,91.0,3.4.221,BIANCA,And say if I shall see you soon at night.
74416,74417,Othello,92.0,3.4.222,CASSIO,"'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,"
74417,74418,Othello,92.0,3.4.223,CASSIO,For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.
74418,74419,Othello,93.0,3.4.224,BIANCA,"'Tis very good, I must be circumstanced."
74419,74420,Othello,93.0,,BIANCA,Exeunt
74420,74421,Othello,93.0,,BIANCA,ACT IV
74421,74422,Othello,93.0,,BIANCA,SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.
74422,74423,Othello,93.0,,BIANCA,Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
74423,74424,Othello,1.0,4.1.1,IAGO,Will you think so?
74424,74425,Othello,2.0,4.1.2,OTHELLO,"Think so, Iago!"
74425,74426,Othello,3.0,4.1.3,IAGO,"What,"
74426,74427,Othello,3.0,4.1.4,IAGO,To kiss in private?
74427,74428,Othello,4.0,4.1.5,OTHELLO,An unauthorized kiss.
74428,74429,Othello,5.0,4.1.6,IAGO,Or to be naked with her friend in bed
74429,74430,Othello,5.0,4.1.7,IAGO,"An hour or more, not meaning any harm?"
74430,74431,Othello,6.0,4.1.8,OTHELLO,"Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!"
74431,74432,Othello,6.0,4.1.9,OTHELLO,It is hypocrisy against the devil:
74432,74433,Othello,6.0,4.1.10,OTHELLO,"They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,"
74433,74434,Othello,6.0,4.1.11,OTHELLO,"The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven."
74434,74435,Othello,7.0,4.1.12,IAGO,"So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:"
74435,74436,Othello,7.0,4.1.13,IAGO,"But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--"
74436,74437,Othello,8.0,4.1.14,OTHELLO,What then?
74437,74438,Othello,9.0,4.1.15,IAGO,"Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord, and, being hers,"
74438,74439,Othello,9.0,4.1.16,IAGO,"She may, I think, bestow't on any man."
74439,74440,Othello,10.0,4.1.17,OTHELLO,She is protectress of her honour too:
74440,74441,Othello,10.0,4.1.18,OTHELLO,May she give that?
74441,74442,Othello,11.0,4.1.19,IAGO,"Her honour is an essence that's not seen,"
74442,74443,Othello,11.0,4.1.20,IAGO,They have it very oft that have it not:
74443,74444,Othello,11.0,4.1.21,IAGO,"But, for the handkerchief,--"
74444,74445,Othello,12.0,4.1.22,OTHELLO,"By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it."
74445,74446,Othello,12.0,4.1.23,OTHELLO,"Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,"
74446,74447,Othello,12.0,4.1.24,OTHELLO,"As doth the raven o'er the infected house,"
74447,74448,Othello,12.0,4.1.25,OTHELLO,Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.
74448,74449,Othello,13.0,4.1.26,IAGO,"Ay, what of that?"
74449,74450,Othello,14.0,4.1.27,OTHELLO,That's not so good now.
74450,74451,Othello,15.0,4.1.28,IAGO,"What,"
74451,74452,Othello,15.0,4.1.29,IAGO,If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
74452,74453,Othello,15.0,4.1.30,IAGO,"Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,"
74453,74454,Othello,15.0,4.1.31,IAGO,"Who having, by their own importunate suit,"
74454,74455,Othello,15.0,4.1.32,IAGO,"Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,"
74455,74456,Othello,15.0,4.1.33,IAGO,"Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose"
74456,74457,Othello,15.0,4.1.34,IAGO,But they must blab--
74457,74458,Othello,16.0,4.1.35,OTHELLO,Hath he said any thing?
74458,74459,Othello,17.0,4.1.36,IAGO,"He hath, my lord, but be you well assured,"
74459,74460,Othello,17.0,4.1.37,IAGO,No more than he'll unswear.
74460,74461,Othello,18.0,4.1.38,OTHELLO,What hath he said?
74461,74462,Othello,19.0,4.1.39,IAGO,"'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did."
74462,74463,Othello,20.0,4.1.40,OTHELLO,What? what?
74463,74464,Othello,21.0,4.1.41,IAGO,Lie--
74464,74465,Othello,22.0,4.1.42,OTHELLO,With her?
74465,74466,Othello,23.0,4.1.43,IAGO,"With her, on her, what you will."
74466,74467,Othello,24.0,4.1.44,OTHELLO,"Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when"
74467,74468,Othello,24.0,4.1.45,OTHELLO,they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
74468,74469,Othello,24.0,4.1.46,OTHELLO,--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
74469,74470,Othello,24.0,4.1.47,OTHELLO,"confess, and be hanged for his labour,--first, to be"
74470,74471,Othello,24.0,4.1.48,OTHELLO,"hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it."
74471,74472,Othello,24.0,4.1.49,OTHELLO,Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
74472,74473,Othello,24.0,4.1.50,OTHELLO,passion without some instruction. It is not words
74473,74474,Othello,24.0,4.1.51,OTHELLO,"that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips."
74474,74475,Othello,24.0,4.1.52,OTHELLO,--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--
74475,74476,Othello,24.0,,OTHELLO,Falls in a trance
74476,74477,Othello,25.0,4.1.53,IAGO,"Work on,"
74477,74478,Othello,25.0,4.1.54,IAGO,"My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,"
74478,74479,Othello,25.0,4.1.55,IAGO,"And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,"
74479,74480,Othello,25.0,4.1.56,IAGO,"All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!"
74480,74481,Othello,25.0,4.1.57,IAGO,"My lord, I say! Othello!"
74481,74482,Othello,25.0,,IAGO,Enter CASSIO
74482,74483,Othello,25.0,4.1.58,IAGO,"How now, Cassio!"
74483,74484,Othello,26.0,4.1.59,CASSIO,What's the matter?
74484,74485,Othello,27.0,4.1.60,IAGO,My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
74485,74486,Othello,27.0,4.1.61,IAGO,"This is his second fit, he had one yesterday."
74486,74487,Othello,28.0,4.1.62,CASSIO,Rub him about the temples.
74487,74488,Othello,29.0,4.1.63,IAGO,"No, forbear,"
74488,74489,Othello,29.0,4.1.64,IAGO,The lethargy must have his quiet course:
74489,74490,Othello,29.0,4.1.65,IAGO,"If not, he foams at mouth and by and by"
74490,74491,Othello,29.0,4.1.66,IAGO,Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
74491,74492,Othello,29.0,4.1.67,IAGO,"Do you withdraw yourself a little while,"
74492,74493,Othello,29.0,4.1.68,IAGO,"He will recover straight: when he is gone,"
74493,74494,Othello,29.0,4.1.69,IAGO,I would on great occasion speak with you.
74494,74495,Othello,29.0,,IAGO,Exit CASSIO
74495,74496,Othello,29.0,4.1.70,IAGO,"How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?"
74496,74497,Othello,30.0,4.1.71,OTHELLO,Dost thou mock me?
74497,74498,Othello,31.0,4.1.72,IAGO,"I mock you! no, by heaven."
74498,74499,Othello,31.0,4.1.73,IAGO,Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
74499,74500,Othello,32.0,4.1.74,OTHELLO,A horned man's a monster and a beast.
74500,74501,Othello,33.0,4.1.75,IAGO,"There's many a beast then in a populous city,"
74501,74502,Othello,33.0,4.1.76,IAGO,And many a civil monster.
74502,74503,Othello,34.0,4.1.77,OTHELLO,Did he confess it?
74503,74504,Othello,35.0,4.1.78,IAGO,"Good sir, be a man,"
74504,74505,Othello,35.0,4.1.79,IAGO,Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
74505,74506,Othello,35.0,4.1.80,IAGO,May draw with you: there's millions now alive
74506,74507,Othello,35.0,4.1.81,IAGO,That nightly lie in those unproper beds
74507,74508,Othello,35.0,4.1.82,IAGO,Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
74508,74509,Othello,35.0,4.1.83,IAGO,"O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,"
74509,74510,Othello,35.0,4.1.84,IAGO,"To lip a wanton in a secure couch,"
74510,74511,Othello,35.0,4.1.85,IAGO,"And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,"
74511,74512,Othello,35.0,4.1.86,IAGO,"And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be."
74512,74513,Othello,36.0,4.1.87,OTHELLO,"O, thou art wise, 'tis certain."
74513,74514,Othello,37.0,4.1.88,IAGO,"Stand you awhile apart,"
74514,74515,Othello,37.0,4.1.89,IAGO,Confine yourself but in a patient list.
74515,74516,Othello,37.0,4.1.90,IAGO,Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
74516,74517,Othello,37.0,4.1.91,IAGO,A passion most unsuiting such a man--
74517,74518,Othello,37.0,4.1.92,IAGO,"Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,"
74518,74519,Othello,37.0,4.1.93,IAGO,"And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,"
74519,74520,Othello,37.0,4.1.94,IAGO,"Bade him anon return and here speak with me,"
74520,74521,Othello,37.0,4.1.95,IAGO,"The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,"
74521,74522,Othello,37.0,4.1.96,IAGO,"And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,"
74522,74523,Othello,37.0,4.1.97,IAGO,"That dwell in every region of his face,"
74523,74524,Othello,37.0,4.1.98,IAGO,"For I will make him tell the tale anew,"
74524,74525,Othello,37.0,4.1.99,IAGO,"Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when"
74525,74526,Othello,37.0,4.1.100,IAGO,"He hath, and is again to cope your wife:"
74526,74527,Othello,37.0,4.1.101,IAGO,"I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,"
74527,74528,Othello,37.0,4.1.102,IAGO,"Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,"
74528,74529,Othello,37.0,4.1.103,IAGO,And nothing of a man.
74529,74530,Othello,38.0,4.1.104,OTHELLO,"Dost thou hear, Iago?"
74530,74531,Othello,38.0,4.1.105,OTHELLO,"I will be found most cunning in my patience,"
74531,74532,Othello,38.0,4.1.106,OTHELLO,But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.
74532,74533,Othello,39.0,4.1.107,IAGO,"That's not amiss,"
74533,74534,Othello,39.0,4.1.108,IAGO,But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
74534,74535,Othello,39.0,,IAGO,OTHELLO retires
74535,74536,Othello,39.0,4.1.109,IAGO,"Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,"
74536,74537,Othello,39.0,4.1.110,IAGO,A housewife that by selling her desires
74537,74538,Othello,39.0,4.1.111,IAGO,Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
74538,74539,Othello,39.0,4.1.112,IAGO,"That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague"
74539,74540,Othello,39.0,4.1.113,IAGO,To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
74540,74541,Othello,39.0,4.1.114,IAGO,"He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain"
74541,74542,Othello,39.0,4.1.115,IAGO,From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
74542,74543,Othello,39.0,,IAGO,Re-enter CASSIO
74543,74544,Othello,39.0,4.1.116,IAGO,"As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,"
74544,74545,Othello,39.0,4.1.117,IAGO,And his unbookish jealousy must construe
74545,74546,Othello,39.0,4.1.118,IAGO,"Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,"
74546,74547,Othello,39.0,4.1.119,IAGO,"Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?"
74547,74548,Othello,40.0,4.1.120,CASSIO,The worser that you give me the addition
74548,74549,Othello,40.0,4.1.121,CASSIO,Whose want even kills me.
74549,74550,Othello,41.0,4.1.122,IAGO,"Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't."
74550,74551,Othello,41.0,,IAGO,Speaking lower
74551,74552,Othello,41.0,4.1.123,IAGO,"Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,"
74552,74553,Othello,41.0,4.1.124,IAGO,How quickly should you speed!
74553,74554,Othello,42.0,4.1.125,CASSIO,"Alas, poor caitiff!"
74554,74555,Othello,43.0,4.1.126,OTHELLO,"Look, how he laughs already!"
74555,74556,Othello,44.0,4.1.127,IAGO,I never knew woman love man so.
74556,74557,Othello,45.0,4.1.128,CASSIO,"Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me."
74557,74558,Othello,46.0,4.1.129,OTHELLO,"Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out."
74558,74559,Othello,47.0,4.1.130,IAGO,"Do you hear, Cassio?"
74559,74560,Othello,48.0,4.1.131,OTHELLO,Now he importunes him
74560,74561,Othello,48.0,4.1.132,OTHELLO,"To tell it o'er: go to, well said, well said."
74561,74562,Othello,49.0,4.1.133,IAGO,She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
74562,74563,Othello,49.0,4.1.134,IAGO,Do you intend it?
74563,74564,Othello,50.0,4.1.135,CASSIO,"Ha, ha, ha!"
74564,74565,Othello,51.0,4.1.136,OTHELLO,"Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?"
74565,74566,Othello,52.0,4.1.137,CASSIO,"I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some"
74566,74567,Othello,52.0,4.1.138,CASSIO,charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
74567,74568,Othello,52.0,4.1.139,CASSIO,"Ha, ha, ha!"
74568,74569,Othello,53.0,4.1.140,OTHELLO,"So, so, so, so: they laugh that win."
74569,74570,Othello,54.0,4.1.141,IAGO,"'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her."
74570,74571,Othello,55.0,4.1.142,CASSIO,"Prithee, say true."
74571,74572,Othello,56.0,4.1.143,IAGO,I am a very villain else.
74572,74573,Othello,57.0,4.1.144,OTHELLO,Have you scored me? Well.
74573,74574,Othello,58.0,4.1.145,CASSIO,This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
74574,74575,Othello,58.0,4.1.146,CASSIO,"persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and"
74575,74576,Othello,58.0,4.1.147,CASSIO,"flattery, not out of my promise."
74576,74577,Othello,59.0,4.1.148,OTHELLO,"Iago beckons me, now he begins the story."
74577,74578,Othello,60.0,4.1.149,CASSIO,"She was here even now, she haunts me in every place."
74578,74579,Othello,60.0,4.1.150,CASSIO,I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
74579,74580,Othello,60.0,4.1.151,CASSIO,"certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble,"
74580,74581,Othello,60.0,4.1.152,CASSIO,"and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--"
74581,74582,Othello,61.0,4.1.153,OTHELLO,Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture

74889,74890,Othello,53.0,4.2.130,DESDEMONA,I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
74890,74891,Othello,53.0,4.2.131,DESDEMONA,Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
74891,74892,Othello,53.0,4.2.132,DESDEMONA,"He might have chid me so, for, in good faith,"
74892,74893,Othello,53.0,4.2.133,DESDEMONA,I am a child to chiding.

74898,74899,Othello,57.0,4.2.139,IAGO,"What name, fair lady?"
74899,74900,Othello,58.0,4.2.140,DESDEMONA,Such as she says my lord did say I was.
74900,74901,Othello,59.0,4.2.141,EMILIA,He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
74901,74902,Othello,59.0,4.2.142,EMILIA,Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.
74902,74903,Othello,60.0,4.2.143,IAGO,Why did he so?
74903,74904,Othello,61.0,4.2.144,DESDEMONA,"I do not know, I am sure I am none such."
74904,74905,Othello,62.0,4.2.145,IAGO,"Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!"

74907,74908,Othello,63.0,4.2.148,EMILIA,To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?
74908,74909,Othello,64.0,4.2.149,DESDEMONA,It is my wretched fortune.
74909,74910,Othello,65.0,4.2.150,IAGO,Beshrew him for't!
74910,74911,Othello,65.0,4.2.151,IAGO,How comes this trick upon him?
74911,74912,Othello,66.0,4.2.152,DESDEMONA,"Nay, heaven doth know."
74912,74913,Othello,67.0,4.2.153,EMILIA,"I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,"
74913,74914,Othello,67.0,4.2.154,EMILIA,"Some busy and insinuating rogue,"
74914,74915,Othello,67.0,4.2.155,EMILIA,"Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,"
74915,74916,Othello,67.0,4.2.156,EMILIA,"Have not devised this slander, I'll be hang'd else."
74916,74917,Othello,68.0,4.2.157,IAGO,"Fie, there is no such man, it is impossible."
74917,74918,Othello,69.0,4.2.158,DESDEMONA,"If any such there be, heaven pardon him!"
74918,74919,Othello,70.0,4.2.159,EMILIA,A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
74919,74920,Othello,70.0,4.2.160,EMILIA,Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
74920,74921,Othello,70.0,4.2.161,EMILIA,What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
74921,74922,Othello,70.0,4.2.162,EMILIA,"The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,"
74922,74923,Othello,70.0,4.2.163,EMILIA,"Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow."
74923,74924,Othello,70.0,4.2.164,EMILIA,"O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,"
74924,74925,Othello,70.0,4.2.165,EMILIA,And put in every honest hand a whip
74925,74926,Othello,70.0,4.2.166,EMILIA,To lash the rascals naked through the world
74926,74927,Othello,70.0,4.2.167,EMILIA,Even from the east to the west!
74927,74928,Othello,71.0,4.2.168,IAGO,Speak within door.
74928,74929,Othello,72.0,4.2.169,EMILIA,"O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was"
74929,74930,Othello,72.0,4.2.170,EMILIA,"That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,"
74930,74931,Othello,72.0,4.2.171,EMILIA,And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
74931,74932,Othello,73.0,4.2.172,IAGO,"You are a fool, go to."
74932,74933,Othello,74.0,4.2.173,DESDEMONA,"O good Iago,"
74933,74934,Othello,74.0,4.2.174,DESDEMONA,What shall I do to win my lord again?
74934,74935,Othello,74.0,4.2.175,DESDEMONA,"Good friend, go to him, for, by this light of heaven,"
74935,74936,Othello,74.0,4.2.176,DESDEMONA,I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
74936,74937,Othello,74.0,4.2.177,DESDEMONA,"If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,"
74937,74938,Othello,74.0,4.2.178,DESDEMONA,"Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,"
74938,74939,Othello,74.0,4.2.179,DESDEMONA,"Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,"
74939,74940,Othello,74.0,4.2.180,DESDEMONA,"Delighted them in any other form,"
74940,74941,Othello,74.0,4.2.181,DESDEMONA,"Or that I do not yet, and ever did."
74941,74942,Othello,74.0,4.2.182,DESDEMONA,And ever will--though he do shake me off
74942,74943,Othello,74.0,4.2.183,DESDEMONA,"To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,"
74943,74944,Othello,74.0,4.2.184,DESDEMONA,"Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much,"
74944,74945,Othello,74.0,4.2.185,DESDEMONA,"And his unkindness may defeat my life,"
74945,74946,Othello,74.0,4.2.186,DESDEMONA,But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
74946,74947,Othello,74.0,4.2.187,DESDEMONA,"It does abhor me now I speak the word,"
74947,74948,Othello,74.0,4.2.188,DESDEMONA,To do the act that might the addition earn
74948,74949,Othello,74.0,4.2.189,DESDEMONA,Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
74949,74950,Othello,75.0,4.2.190,IAGO,"I pray you, be content, 'tis but his humour:"
74950,74951,Othello,75.0,4.2.191,IAGO,"The business of the state does him offence,"
74951,74952,Othello,75.0,4.2.192,IAGO,And he does chide with you.
74952,74953,Othello,76.0,4.2.193,DESDEMONA,If 'twere no other--

74960,74961,Othello,77.0,4.2.198,IAGO,"How now, Roderigo!"
74961,74962,Othello,78.0,4.2.199,RODERIGO,I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
74962,74963,Othello,79.0,4.2.200,IAGO,What in the contrary?
74963,74964,Othello,80.0,4.2.201,RODERIGO,"Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago,"
74964,74965,Othello,80.0,4.2.202,RODERIGO,"and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me"
74965,74966,Othello,80.0,4.2.203,RODERIGO,all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
74966,74967,Othello,80.0,4.2.204,RODERIGO,advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
74967,74968,Othello,80.0,4.2.205,RODERIGO,"it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what"
74968,74969,Othello,80.0,4.2.206,RODERIGO,already I have foolishly suffered.
74969,74970,Othello,81.0,4.2.207,IAGO,"Will you hear me, Roderigo?"
74970,74971,Othello,82.0,4.2.208,RODERIGO,"'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and"
74971,74972,Othello,82.0,4.2.209,RODERIGO,performances are no kin together.
74972,74973,Othello,83.0,4.2.210,IAGO,You charge me most unjustly.
74973,74974,Othello,84.0,4.2.211,RODERIGO,With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
74974,74975,Othello,84.0,4.2.212,RODERIGO,my means. The jewels you have had from me to
74975,74976,Othello,84.0,4.2.213,RODERIGO,deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
74976,74977,Othello,84.0,4.2.214,RODERIGO,votarist: you have told me she hath received them
74977,74978,Othello,84.0,4.2.215,RODERIGO,and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
74978,74979,Othello,84.0,4.2.216,RODERIGO,"respect and acquaintance, but I find none."
74979,74980,Othello,85.0,4.2.217,IAGO,"Well, go to, very well."

74981,74982,Othello,86.0,4.2.219,RODERIGO,"not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin"
74982,74983,Othello,86.0,4.2.220,RODERIGO,to find myself fobbed in it.
74983,74984,Othello,87.0,4.2.221,IAGO,Very well.
74984,74985,Othello,88.0,4.2.222,RODERIGO,I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
74985,74986,Othello,88.0,4.2.223,RODERIGO,known to Desdemona: if she will return me my

74987,74988,Othello,88.0,4.2.225,RODERIGO,"unlawful solicitation, if not, assure yourself I"
74988,74989,Othello,88.0,4.2.226,RODERIGO,will seek satisfaction of you.
74989,74990,Othello,89.0,4.2.227,IAGO,You have said now.
74990,74991,Othello,90.0,4.2.228,RODERIGO,"Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing."
74991,74992,Othello,91.0,4.2.229,IAGO,"Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from"
74992,74993,Othello,91.0,4.2.230,IAGO,this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
74993,74994,Othello,91.0,4.2.231,IAGO,"ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast"
74994,74995,Othello,91.0,4.2.232,IAGO,"taken against me a most just exception, but yet, I"
74995,74996,Othello,91.0,4.2.233,IAGO,"protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair."
74996,74997,Othello,92.0,4.2.234,RODERIGO,It hath not appeared.
74997,74998,Othello,93.0,4.2.235,IAGO,"I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your"
74998,74999,Othello,93.0,4.2.236,IAGO,"suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,"
74999,75000,Othello,93.0,4.2.237,IAGO,"Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I"
75000,75001,Othello,93.0,4.2.238,IAGO,"have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean"
75001,75002,Othello,93.0,4.2.239,IAGO,"purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if"
75002,75003,Othello,93.0,4.2.240,IAGO,"thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,"
75003,75004,Othello,93.0,4.2.241,IAGO,take me from this world with treachery and devise
75004,75005,Othello,93.0,4.2.242,IAGO,engines for my life.
75005,75006,Othello,94.0,4.2.243,RODERIGO,"Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?"
75006,75007,Othello,95.0,4.2.244,IAGO,"Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice"
75007,75008,Othello,95.0,4.2.245,IAGO,to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
75008,75009,Othello,96.0,4.2.246,RODERIGO,"Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona"
75009,75010,Othello,96.0,4.2.247,RODERIGO,return again to Venice.
75010,75011,Othello,97.0,4.2.248,IAGO,"O, no, he goes into Mauritania and takes away with"
75011,75012,Othello,97.0,4.2.249,IAGO,"him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be"
75012,75013,Othello,97.0,4.2.250,IAGO,lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
75013,75014,Othello,97.0,4.2.251,IAGO,so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
75014,75015,Othello,98.0,4.2.252,RODERIGO,"How do you mean, removing of him?"
75015,75016,Othello,99.0,4.2.253,IAGO,"Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place,"
75016,75017,Othello,99.0,4.2.254,IAGO,knocking out his brains.
75017,75018,Othello,100.0,4.2.255,RODERIGO,And that you would have me to do?
75018,75019,Othello,101.0,4.2.256,IAGO,"Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right."
75019,75020,Othello,101.0,4.2.257,IAGO,"He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I"
75020,75021,Othello,101.0,4.2.258,IAGO,go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
75021,75022,Othello,101.0,4.2.259,IAGO,"fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which"
75022,75023,Othello,101.0,4.2.260,IAGO,"I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,"
75023,75024,Othello,101.0,4.2.261,IAGO,you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
75024,75025,Othello,101.0,4.2.262,IAGO,"to second your attempt, and he shall fall between"
75025,75026,Othello,101.0,4.2.263,IAGO,"us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with"
75026,75027,Othello,101.0,4.2.264,IAGO,"me, I will show you such a necessity in his death"
75027,75028,Othello,101.0,4.2.265,IAGO,that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
75028,75029,Othello,101.0,4.2.266,IAGO,"him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows"
75029,75030,Othello,101.0,4.2.267,IAGO,to waste: about it.
75030,75031,Othello,102.0,4.2.268,RODERIGO,I will hear further reason for this.
75031,75032,Othello,103.0,4.2.269,IAGO,And you shall be satisfied.

75063,75064,Othello,18.0,4.3.28,DESDEMONA,My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:

75074,75075,Othello,21.0,4.3.39,EMILIA,A very handsome man.

75106,75107,Othello,30.0,4.3.69,DESDEMONA,Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
75107,75108,Othello,31.0,4.3.70,EMILIA,"Why, would not you?"

75110,75111,Othello,33.0,4.3.73,EMILIA,I might do't as well i' the dark.
75111,75112,Othello,34.0,4.3.74,DESDEMONA,Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

75113,75114,Othello,35.0,4.3.76,EMILIA,For a small vice.
75114,75115,Othello,36.0,4.3.77,DESDEMONA,"In troth, I think thou wouldst not."
75115,75116,Othello,37.0,4.3.78,EMILIA,"In troth, I think I should, and undo't when I had"

75141,75142,Othello,41.0,4.3.104,EMILIA,When they change us for others? Is it sport?
75142,75143,Othello,41.0,4.3.105,EMILIA,I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
75143,75144,Othello,41.0,4.3.106,EMILIA,I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?

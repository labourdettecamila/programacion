67110,67111,A Midsummer nights dream,19.0,1.1.110,LYSANDER,"And won her soul, and she, sweet lady, dotes,"
67111,67112,A Midsummer nights dream,19.0,1.1.111,LYSANDER,"Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,"
67112,67113,A Midsummer nights dream,19.0,1.1.112,LYSANDER,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

67114,67115,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.114,THESEUS,"And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof,"
67115,67116,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.115,THESEUS,"But, being over-full of self-affairs,"
67116,67117,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.116,THESEUS,"My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come,"
67117,67118,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.117,THESEUS,"And come, Egeus, you shall go with me,"

67121,67122,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.121,THESEUS,Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
67122,67123,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.122,THESEUS,Which by no means we may extenuate--
67123,67124,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.123,THESEUS,"To death, or to a vow of single life."
67124,67125,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.124,THESEUS,"Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?"
67125,67126,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,1.1.125,THESEUS,"Demetrius and Egeus, go along:"

67132,67133,A Midsummer nights dream,22.0,1.1.131,LYSANDER,How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
67133,67134,A Midsummer nights dream,23.0,1.1.132,HERMIA,"Belike for want of rain, which I could well"
67134,67135,A Midsummer nights dream,23.0,1.1.133,HERMIA,Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
67135,67136,A Midsummer nights dream,24.0,1.1.134,LYSANDER,"Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,"
67136,67137,A Midsummer nights dream,24.0,1.1.135,LYSANDER,"Could ever hear by tale or history,"
67137,67138,A Midsummer nights dream,24.0,1.1.136,LYSANDER,"The course of true love never did run smooth,"
67138,67139,A Midsummer nights dream,24.0,1.1.137,LYSANDER,"But, either it was different in blood,--"
67139,67140,A Midsummer nights dream,25.0,1.1.138,HERMIA,O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
67140,67141,A Midsummer nights dream,26.0,1.1.139,LYSANDER,"Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--"
67141,67142,A Midsummer nights dream,27.0,1.1.140,HERMIA,O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
67142,67143,A Midsummer nights dream,28.0,1.1.141,LYSANDER,"Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--"
67143,67144,A Midsummer nights dream,29.0,1.1.142,HERMIA,O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
67144,67145,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.143,LYSANDER,"Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,"
67145,67146,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.144,LYSANDER,"War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,"
67146,67147,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.145,LYSANDER,"Making it momentany as a sound,"
67147,67148,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.146,LYSANDER,"Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,"
67148,67149,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.147,LYSANDER,"Brief as the lightning in the collied night,"
67149,67150,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.148,LYSANDER,"That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,"
67150,67151,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.149,LYSANDER,And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
67151,67152,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.150,LYSANDER,The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
67152,67153,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,1.1.151,LYSANDER,So quick bright things come to confusion.
67153,67154,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,1.1.152,HERMIA,"If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,"
67154,67155,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,1.1.153,HERMIA,It stands as an edict in destiny:
67155,67156,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,1.1.154,HERMIA,"Then let us teach our trial patience,"
67156,67157,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,1.1.155,HERMIA,"Because it is a customary cross,"
67157,67158,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,1.1.156,HERMIA,"As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,"
67158,67159,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,1.1.157,HERMIA,"Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers."
67159,67160,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.158,LYSANDER,"A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia."
67160,67161,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.159,LYSANDER,"I have a widow aunt, a dowager"
67161,67162,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.160,LYSANDER,"Of great revenue, and she hath no child:"
67162,67163,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.161,LYSANDER,"From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,"
67163,67164,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.162,LYSANDER,And she respects me as her only son.
67164,67165,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.163,LYSANDER,"There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,"
67165,67166,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.164,LYSANDER,And to that place the sharp Athenian law
67166,67167,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.165,LYSANDER,"Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,"
67167,67168,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.166,LYSANDER,"Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night,"
67168,67169,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.167,LYSANDER,"And in the wood, a league without the town,"
67169,67170,A Midsummer nights dream,32.0,1.1.168,LYSANDER,"Where I did meet thee once with Helena,"

67526,67527,A Midsummer nights dream,20.0,2.1.157,PUCK,I remember.
67527,67528,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.158,OBERON,"That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,"

67529,67530,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.160,OBERON,Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
67530,67531,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.161,OBERON,"At a fair vestal throned by the west,"
67531,67532,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.162,OBERON,"And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,"
67532,67533,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.163,OBERON,"As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,"
67533,67534,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.164,OBERON,But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft

67537,67538,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.168,OBERON,Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
67538,67539,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.169,OBERON,"It fell upon a little western flower,"

67540,67541,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.171,OBERON,And maidens call it love-in-idleness.

67542,67543,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.173,OBERON,The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid

67545,67546,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.176,OBERON,"Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again"
67546,67547,A Midsummer nights dream,21.0,2.1.177,OBERON,Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
67547,67548,A Midsummer nights dream,22.0,2.1.178,PUCK,I'll put a girdle round about the earth

67556,67557,A Midsummer nights dream,23.0,2.1.186,OBERON,She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
67557,67558,A Midsummer nights dream,23.0,2.1.187,OBERON,"And ere I take this charm from off her sight,"
67558,67559,A Midsummer nights dream,23.0,2.1.188,OBERON,"As I can take it with another herb,"
67559,67560,A Midsummer nights dream,23.0,2.1.189,OBERON,I'll make her render up her page to me.
67560,67561,A Midsummer nights dream,23.0,2.1.190,OBERON,"But who comes here? I am invisible,"

67573,67574,A Midsummer nights dream,25.0,2.1.202,HELENA,And I shall have no power to follow you.
67574,67575,A Midsummer nights dream,26.0,2.1.203,DEMETRIUS,Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
67575,67576,A Midsummer nights dream,26.0,2.1.204,DEMETRIUS,"Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth"
67576,67577,A Midsummer nights dream,26.0,2.1.205,DEMETRIUS,"Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?"

67587,67588,A Midsummer nights dream,28.0,2.1.216,DEMETRIUS,For I am sick when I do look on thee.
67588,67589,A Midsummer nights dream,29.0,2.1.217,HELENA,And I am sick when I look not on you.
67589,67590,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,2.1.218,DEMETRIUS,"You do impeach your modesty too much,"
67590,67591,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,2.1.219,DEMETRIUS,To leave the city and commit yourself

67592,67593,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,2.1.221,DEMETRIUS,To trust the opportunity of night

67594,67595,A Midsummer nights dream,30.0,2.1.223,DEMETRIUS,With the rich worth of your virginity.
67595,67596,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,2.1.224,HELENA,Your virtue is my privilege: for that

67597,67598,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,2.1.226,HELENA,"Therefore I think I am not in the night,"
67598,67599,A Midsummer nights dream,31.0,2.1.227,HELENA,"Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,"

67612,67613,A Midsummer nights dream,34.0,2.1.241,DEMETRIUS,But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
67613,67614,A Midsummer nights dream,35.0,2.1.242,HELENA,"Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,"
67614,67615,A Midsummer nights dream,35.0,2.1.243,HELENA,"You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!"

68233,68234,A Midsummer nights dream,41.0,3.2.193,LYSANDER,"Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,"
68234,68235,A Midsummer nights dream,41.0,3.2.194,LYSANDER,The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
68235,68236,A Midsummer nights dream,42.0,3.2.195,HERMIA,You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
68236,68237,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.196,HELENA,"Lo, she is one of this confederacy!"
68237,68238,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.197,HELENA,Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
68238,68239,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.198,HELENA,"To fashion this false sport, in spite of me."
68239,68240,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.199,HELENA,Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
68240,68241,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.200,HELENA,"Have you conspired, have you with these contrived"
68241,68242,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.201,HELENA,To bait me with this foul derision?
68242,68243,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.202,HELENA,"Is all the counsel that we two have shared,"
68243,68244,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.203,HELENA,"The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,"
68244,68245,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.204,HELENA,When we have chid the hasty-footed time
68245,68246,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.205,HELENA,"For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?"
68246,68247,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.206,HELENA,"All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?"
68247,68248,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.207,HELENA,"We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,"
68248,68249,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.208,HELENA,"Have with our needles created both one flower,"
68249,68250,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.209,HELENA,"Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,"
68250,68251,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.210,HELENA,"Both warbling of one song, both in one key,"
68251,68252,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.211,HELENA,"As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,"
68252,68253,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.212,HELENA,"Had been incorporate. So we grow together,"
68253,68254,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.213,HELENA,"Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,"
68254,68255,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.214,HELENA,"But yet an union in partition,"
68255,68256,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.215,HELENA,"Two lovely berries moulded on one stem,"
68256,68257,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.216,HELENA,"So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart,"
68257,68258,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.217,HELENA,"Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,"
68258,68259,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.218,HELENA,Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
68259,68260,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.219,HELENA,"And will you rent our ancient love asunder,"
68260,68261,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.220,HELENA,To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
68261,68262,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.221,HELENA,"It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:"
68262,68263,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.222,HELENA,"Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,"
68263,68264,A Midsummer nights dream,43.0,3.2.223,HELENA,Though I alone do feel the injury.
68264,68265,A Midsummer nights dream,44.0,3.2.224,HERMIA,I am amazed at your passionate words.
68265,68266,A Midsummer nights dream,44.0,3.2.225,HERMIA,I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
68266,68267,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.226,HELENA,"Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,"
68267,68268,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.227,HELENA,To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
68268,68269,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.228,HELENA,"And made your other love, Demetrius,"
68269,68270,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.229,HELENA,"Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,"
68270,68271,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.230,HELENA,"To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,"
68271,68272,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.231,HELENA,"Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this"
68272,68273,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.232,HELENA,To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
68273,68274,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.233,HELENA,"Deny your love, so rich within his soul,"
68274,68275,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.234,HELENA,"And tender me, forsooth, affection,"
68275,68276,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.235,HELENA,"But by your setting on, by your consent?"
68276,68277,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.236,HELENA,"What thought I be not so in grace as you,"
68277,68278,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.237,HELENA,"So hung upon with love, so fortunate,"
68278,68279,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.238,HELENA,"But miserable most, to love unloved?"
68279,68280,A Midsummer nights dream,45.0,3.2.239,HELENA,This you should pity rather than despise.
68280,68281,A Midsummer nights dream,46.0,3.2.240,HERNIA,I understand not what you mean by this.
68281,68282,A Midsummer nights dream,47.0,3.2.241,HELENA,"Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,"
68282,68283,A Midsummer nights dream,47.0,3.2.242,HELENA,"Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,"

68285,68286,A Midsummer nights dream,47.0,3.2.245,HELENA,"If you have any pity, grace, or manners,"
68286,68287,A Midsummer nights dream,47.0,3.2.246,HELENA,You would not make me such an argument.
68287,68288,A Midsummer nights dream,47.0,3.2.247,HELENA,"But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault,"
68288,68289,A Midsummer nights dream,47.0,3.2.248,HELENA,Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
68289,68290,A Midsummer nights dream,48.0,3.2.249,LYSANDER,"Stay, gentle Helena, hear my excuse:"
68290,68291,A Midsummer nights dream,48.0,3.2.250,LYSANDER,"My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!"
68291,68292,A Midsummer nights dream,49.0,3.2.251,HELENA,O excellent!
68292,68293,A Midsummer nights dream,50.0,3.2.252,HERMIA,"Sweet, do not scorn her so."
68293,68294,A Midsummer nights dream,51.0,3.2.253,DEMETRIUS,"If she cannot entreat, I can compel."
68294,68295,A Midsummer nights dream,52.0,3.2.254,LYSANDER,Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
68295,68296,A Midsummer nights dream,52.0,3.2.255,LYSANDER,Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
68296,68297,A Midsummer nights dream,52.0,3.2.256,LYSANDER,"Helen, I love thee, by my life, I do:"
68297,68298,A Midsummer nights dream,52.0,3.2.257,LYSANDER,"I swear by that which I will lose for thee,"
68298,68299,A Midsummer nights dream,52.0,3.2.258,LYSANDER,To prove him false that says I love thee not.
68299,68300,A Midsummer nights dream,53.0,3.2.259,DEMETRIUS,I say I love thee more than he can do.
68300,68301,A Midsummer nights dream,54.0,3.2.260,LYSANDER,"If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too."
68301,68302,A Midsummer nights dream,55.0,3.2.261,DEMETRIUS,"Quick, come!"
68302,68303,A Midsummer nights dream,56.0,3.2.262,HERMIA,"Lysander, whereto tends all this?"
68303,68304,A Midsummer nights dream,57.0,3.2.263,LYSANDER,"Away, you Ethiope!"
68304,68305,A Midsummer nights dream,58.0,3.2.264,DEMETRIUS,"No, no, he'll [        ]"
68305,68306,A Midsummer nights dream,58.0,3.2.265,DEMETRIUS,"Seem to break loose, take on as you would follow,"
68306,68307,A Midsummer nights dream,58.0,3.2.266,DEMETRIUS,"But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!"
68307,68308,A Midsummer nights dream,59.0,3.2.267,LYSANDER,"Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,"
68308,68309,A Midsummer nights dream,59.0,3.2.268,LYSANDER,Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
68309,68310,A Midsummer nights dream,60.0,3.2.269,HERMIA,Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
68310,68311,A Midsummer nights dream,60.0,3.2.270,HERMIA,"Sweet love,--"
68311,68312,A Midsummer nights dream,61.0,3.2.271,LYSANDER,"Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!"
68312,68313,A Midsummer nights dream,61.0,3.2.272,LYSANDER,"Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!"
68313,68314,A Midsummer nights dream,62.0,3.2.273,HERMIA,Do you not jest?
68314,68315,A Midsummer nights dream,63.0,3.2.274,HELENA,"Yes, sooth, and so do you."
68315,68316,A Midsummer nights dream,64.0,3.2.275,LYSANDER,"Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee."
68316,68317,A Midsummer nights dream,65.0,3.2.276,DEMETRIUS,"I would I had your bond, for I perceive"
68317,68318,A Midsummer nights dream,65.0,3.2.277,DEMETRIUS,A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
68318,68319,A Midsummer nights dream,66.0,3.2.278,LYSANDER,"What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?"
68319,68320,A Midsummer nights dream,66.0,3.2.279,LYSANDER,"Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so."
68320,68321,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.280,HERMIA,"What, can you do me greater harm than hate?"
68321,68322,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.281,HERMIA,"Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!"
68322,68323,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.282,HERMIA,Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
68323,68324,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.283,HERMIA,I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
68324,68325,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.284,HERMIA,"Since night you loved me, yet since night you left"
68325,68326,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.285,HERMIA,me:
68326,68327,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.286,HERMIA,"Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--"
68327,68328,A Midsummer nights dream,67.0,3.2.287,HERMIA,"In earnest, shall I say?"
68328,68329,A Midsummer nights dream,68.0,3.2.288,LYSANDER,"Ay, by my life,"
68329,68330,A Midsummer nights dream,68.0,3.2.289,LYSANDER,And never did desire to see thee more.
68330,68331,A Midsummer nights dream,68.0,3.2.290,LYSANDER,"Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt,"
68331,68332,A Midsummer nights dream,68.0,3.2.291,LYSANDER,"Be certain, nothing truer, 'tis no jest"
68332,68333,A Midsummer nights dream,68.0,3.2.292,LYSANDER,That I do hate thee and love Helena.
68333,68334,A Midsummer nights dream,69.0,3.2.293,HERMIA,O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
68334,68335,A Midsummer nights dream,69.0,3.2.294,HERMIA,"You thief of love! what, have you come by night"
68335,68336,A Midsummer nights dream,69.0,3.2.295,HERMIA,And stolen my love's heart from him?
68336,68337,A Midsummer nights dream,70.0,3.2.296,HELENA,"Fine, i'faith!"
68337,68338,A Midsummer nights dream,70.0,3.2.297,HELENA,"Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,"
68338,68339,A Midsummer nights dream,70.0,3.2.298,HELENA,"No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear"
68339,68340,A Midsummer nights dream,70.0,3.2.299,HELENA,Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
68340,68341,A Midsummer nights dream,70.0,3.2.300,HELENA,"Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!"
68341,68342,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.301,HERMIA,"Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game."
68342,68343,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.302,HERMIA,Now I perceive that she hath made compare
68343,68344,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.303,HERMIA,"Between our statures, she hath urged her height,"
68344,68345,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.304,HERMIA,"And with her personage, her tall personage,"
68345,68346,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.305,HERMIA,"Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him."
68346,68347,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.306,HERMIA,"And are you grown so high in his esteem,"
68347,68348,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.307,HERMIA,Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
68348,68349,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.308,HERMIA,"How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak,"
68349,68350,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.309,HERMIA,How low am I? I am not yet so low
68350,68351,A Midsummer nights dream,71.0,3.2.310,HERMIA,But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
68351,68352,A Midsummer nights dream,72.0,3.2.311,HELENA,"I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,"
68352,68353,A Midsummer nights dream,72.0,3.2.312,HELENA,"Let her not hurt me: I was never curst,"
68353,68354,A Midsummer nights dream,72.0,3.2.313,HELENA,"I have no gift at all in shrewishness,"
68354,68355,A Midsummer nights dream,72.0,3.2.314,HELENA,I am a right maid for my cowardice:
68355,68356,A Midsummer nights dream,72.0,3.2.315,HELENA,"Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,"
68356,68357,A Midsummer nights dream,72.0,3.2.316,HELENA,"Because she is something lower than myself,"
68357,68358,A Midsummer nights dream,72.0,3.2.317,HELENA,That I can match her.
68358,68359,A Midsummer nights dream,73.0,3.2.318,HERMIA,"Lower! hark, again."
68359,68360,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.319,HELENA,"Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me."
68360,68361,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.320,HELENA,"I evermore did love you, Hermia,"
68361,68362,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.321,HELENA,"Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you,"
68362,68363,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.322,HELENA,"Save that, in love unto Demetrius,"
68363,68364,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.323,HELENA,I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
68364,68365,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.324,HELENA,"He follow'd you, for love I follow'd him,"
68365,68366,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.325,HELENA,But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
68366,68367,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.326,HELENA,"To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:"
68367,68368,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.327,HELENA,"And now, so you will let me quiet go,"
68368,68369,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.328,HELENA,To Athens will I bear my folly back
68369,68370,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.329,HELENA,And follow you no further: let me go:
68370,68371,A Midsummer nights dream,74.0,3.2.330,HELENA,You see how simple and how fond I am.
68371,68372,A Midsummer nights dream,75.0,3.2.331,HERMIA,"Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?"
68372,68373,A Midsummer nights dream,76.0,3.2.332,HELENA,"A foolish heart, that I leave here behind."
68373,68374,A Midsummer nights dream,77.0,3.2.333,HERMIA,"What, with Lysander?"
68374,68375,A Midsummer nights dream,78.0,3.2.334,HELENA,With Demetrius.
68375,68376,A Midsummer nights dream,79.0,3.2.335,LYSANDER,"Be not afraid, she shall not harm thee, Helena."
68376,68377,A Midsummer nights dream,80.0,3.2.336,DEMETRIUS,"No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part."
68377,68378,A Midsummer nights dream,81.0,3.2.337,HELENA,"O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!"
68378,68379,A Midsummer nights dream,81.0,3.2.338,HELENA,"She was a vixen when she went to school,"
68379,68380,A Midsummer nights dream,81.0,3.2.339,HELENA,"And though she be but little, she is fierce."
68380,68381,A Midsummer nights dream,82.0,3.2.340,HERMIA,'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
68381,68382,A Midsummer nights dream,82.0,3.2.341,HERMIA,Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
68382,68383,A Midsummer nights dream,82.0,3.2.342,HERMIA,Let me come to her.
68383,68384,A Midsummer nights dream,83.0,3.2.343,LYSANDER,"Get you gone, you dwarf,"

68385,68386,A Midsummer nights dream,83.0,3.2.345,LYSANDER,"You bead, you acorn."
68386,68387,A Midsummer nights dream,84.0,3.2.346,DEMETRIUS,You are too officious
68387,68388,A Midsummer nights dream,84.0,3.2.347,DEMETRIUS,In her behalf that scorns your services.
68388,68389,A Midsummer nights dream,84.0,3.2.348,DEMETRIUS,"Let her alone: speak not of Helena,"

68392,68393,A Midsummer nights dream,85.0,3.2.352,LYSANDER,"Now she holds me not,"
68393,68394,A Midsummer nights dream,85.0,3.2.353,LYSANDER,"Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,"
68394,68395,A Midsummer nights dream,85.0,3.2.354,LYSANDER,"Of thine or mine, is most in Helena."
68395,68396,A Midsummer nights dream,86.0,3.2.355,DEMETRIUS,"Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole."

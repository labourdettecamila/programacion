78404,78405,Richard II,31.0,,GOWER,SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace.
78405,78406,Richard II,31.0,,GOWER,"Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants"
78406,78407,Richard II,1.0,1.1.1,KING RICHARD II,"Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,"
78407,78408,Richard II,1.0,1.1.2,KING RICHARD II,"Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,"
78408,78409,Richard II,1.0,1.1.3,KING RICHARD II,"Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,"
78409,78410,Richard II,1.0,1.1.4,KING RICHARD II,"Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,"
78410,78411,Richard II,1.0,1.1.5,KING RICHARD II,"Which then our leisure would not let us hear,"
78411,78412,Richard II,1.0,1.1.6,KING RICHARD II,"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?"
78412,78413,Richard II,2.0,1.1.7,JOHN OF GAUNT,"I have, my liege."
78413,78414,Richard II,3.0,1.1.8,KING RICHARD II,"Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,"
78414,78415,Richard II,3.0,1.1.9,KING RICHARD II,"If he appeal the duke on ancient malice,"
78415,78416,Richard II,3.0,1.1.10,KING RICHARD II,"Or worthily, as a good subject should,"
78416,78417,Richard II,3.0,1.1.11,KING RICHARD II,On some known ground of treachery in him?
78417,78418,Richard II,4.0,1.1.12,JOHN OF GAUNT,"As near as I could sift him on that argument,"
78418,78419,Richard II,4.0,1.1.13,JOHN OF GAUNT,On some apparent danger seen in him
78419,78420,Richard II,4.0,1.1.14,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice."
78420,78421,Richard II,5.0,1.1.15,KING RICHARD II,"Then call them to our presence, face to face,"
78421,78422,Richard II,5.0,1.1.16,KING RICHARD II,"And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear"
78422,78423,Richard II,5.0,1.1.17,KING RICHARD II,The accuser and the accused freely speak:
78423,78424,Richard II,5.0,1.1.18,KING RICHARD II,"High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,"
78424,78425,Richard II,5.0,1.1.19,KING RICHARD II,"In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire."
78425,78426,Richard II,5.0,,KING RICHARD II,Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY
78426,78427,Richard II,6.0,1.1.20,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Many years of happy days befal
78427,78428,Richard II,6.0,1.1.21,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!"
78428,78429,Richard II,7.0,1.1.22,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Each day still better other's happiness,"
78429,78430,Richard II,7.0,1.1.23,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,"
78430,78431,Richard II,7.0,1.1.24,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Add an immortal title to your crown!
78431,78432,Richard II,8.0,1.1.25,KING RICHARD II,"We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,"
78432,78433,Richard II,8.0,1.1.26,KING RICHARD II,"As well appeareth by the cause you come,"
78433,78434,Richard II,8.0,1.1.27,KING RICHARD II,Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
78434,78435,Richard II,8.0,1.1.28,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object"
78435,78436,Richard II,8.0,1.1.29,KING RICHARD II,"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?"
78436,78437,Richard II,9.0,1.1.30,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"First, heaven be the record to my speech!"
78437,78438,Richard II,9.0,1.1.31,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In the devotion of a subject's love,"
78438,78439,Richard II,9.0,1.1.32,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Tendering the precious safety of my prince,"
78439,78440,Richard II,9.0,1.1.33,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And free from other misbegotten hate,"
78440,78441,Richard II,9.0,1.1.34,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Come I appellant to this princely presence.
78441,78442,Richard II,9.0,1.1.35,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,"
78442,78443,Richard II,9.0,1.1.36,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And mark my greeting well, for what I speak"
78443,78444,Richard II,9.0,1.1.37,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My body shall make good upon this earth,"
78444,78445,Richard II,9.0,1.1.38,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
78445,78446,Richard II,9.0,1.1.39,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,"
78446,78447,Richard II,9.0,1.1.40,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Too good to be so and too bad to live,"
78447,78448,Richard II,9.0,1.1.41,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,"
78448,78449,Richard II,9.0,1.1.42,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
78449,78450,Richard II,9.0,1.1.43,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Once more, the more to aggravate the note,"
78450,78451,Richard II,9.0,1.1.44,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat,"
78451,78452,Richard II,9.0,1.1.45,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,"
78452,78453,Richard II,9.0,1.1.46,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
78453,78454,Richard II,10.0,1.1.47,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
78454,78455,Richard II,10.0,1.1.48,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,"
78455,78456,Richard II,10.0,1.1.49,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,"
78456,78457,Richard II,10.0,1.1.50,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain,"
78457,78458,Richard II,10.0,1.1.51,THOMAS MOWBRAY,The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
78458,78459,Richard II,10.0,1.1.52,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
78459,78460,Richard II,10.0,1.1.53,THOMAS MOWBRAY,As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
78460,78461,Richard II,10.0,1.1.54,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me"
78461,78462,Richard II,10.0,1.1.55,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,"
78462,78463,Richard II,10.0,1.1.56,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Which else would post until it had return'd
78463,78464,Richard II,10.0,1.1.57,THOMAS MOWBRAY,These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
78464,78465,Richard II,10.0,1.1.58,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Setting aside his high blood's royalty,"
78465,78466,Richard II,10.0,1.1.59,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And let him be no kinsman to my liege,"
78466,78467,Richard II,10.0,1.1.60,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I do defy him, and I spit at him,"
78467,78468,Richard II,10.0,1.1.61,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
78468,78469,Richard II,10.0,1.1.62,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which to maintain I would allow him odds,"
78469,78470,Richard II,10.0,1.1.63,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And meet him, were I tied to run afoot"
78470,78471,Richard II,10.0,1.1.64,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,"
78471,78472,Richard II,10.0,1.1.65,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Or any other ground inhabitable,"
78472,78473,Richard II,10.0,1.1.66,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
78473,78474,Richard II,10.0,1.1.67,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Mean time let this defend my loyalty,"
78474,78475,Richard II,10.0,1.1.68,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie."
78475,78476,Richard II,11.0,1.1.69,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,"
78476,78477,Richard II,11.0,1.1.70,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,"
78477,78478,Richard II,11.0,1.1.71,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And lay aside my high blood's royalty,"
78478,78479,Richard II,11.0,1.1.72,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except."
78479,78480,Richard II,11.0,1.1.73,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
78480,78481,Richard II,11.0,1.1.74,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:"
78481,78482,Richard II,11.0,1.1.75,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By that and all the rites of knighthood else,"
78482,78483,Richard II,11.0,1.1.76,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,"
78483,78484,Richard II,11.0,1.1.77,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise."
78484,78485,Richard II,12.0,1.1.78,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I take it up, and by that sword I swear"
78485,78486,Richard II,12.0,1.1.79,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,"
78486,78487,Richard II,12.0,1.1.80,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I'll answer thee in any fair degree,"
78487,78488,Richard II,12.0,1.1.81,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
78488,78489,Richard II,12.0,1.1.82,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And when I mount, alive may I not light,"
78489,78490,Richard II,12.0,1.1.83,THOMAS MOWBRAY,If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
78490,78491,Richard II,13.0,1.1.84,KING RICHARD II,What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
78491,78492,Richard II,13.0,1.1.85,KING RICHARD II,It must be great that can inherit us
78492,78493,Richard II,13.0,1.1.86,KING RICHARD II,So much as of a thought of ill in him.
78493,78494,Richard II,14.0,1.1.87,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true,"
78494,78495,Richard II,14.0,1.1.88,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
78495,78496,Richard II,14.0,1.1.89,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,"
78496,78497,Richard II,14.0,1.1.90,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,"
78497,78498,Richard II,14.0,1.1.91,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
78498,78499,Richard II,14.0,1.1.92,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Besides I say and will in battle prove,"
78499,78500,Richard II,14.0,1.1.93,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
78500,78501,Richard II,14.0,1.1.94,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That ever was survey'd by English eye,"
78501,78502,Richard II,14.0,1.1.95,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,That all the treasons for these eighteen years
78502,78503,Richard II,14.0,1.1.96,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Complotted and contrived in this land
78503,78504,Richard II,14.0,1.1.97,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
78504,78505,Richard II,14.0,1.1.98,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Further I say and further will maintain
78505,78506,Richard II,14.0,1.1.99,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Upon his bad life to make all this good,"
78506,78507,Richard II,14.0,1.1.100,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,"
78507,78508,Richard II,14.0,1.1.101,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,"
78508,78509,Richard II,14.0,1.1.102,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And consequently, like a traitor coward,"
78509,78510,Richard II,14.0,1.1.103,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
78510,78511,Richard II,14.0,1.1.104,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,"
78511,78512,Richard II,14.0,1.1.105,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,"
78512,78513,Richard II,14.0,1.1.106,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To me for justice and rough chastisement,"
78513,78514,Richard II,14.0,1.1.107,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, by the glorious worth of my descent,"
78514,78515,Richard II,14.0,1.1.108,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"This arm shall do it, or this life be spent."
78515,78516,Richard II,15.0,1.1.109,KING RICHARD II,How high a pitch his resolution soars!
78516,78517,Richard II,15.0,1.1.110,KING RICHARD II,"Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?"
78517,78518,Richard II,16.0,1.1.111,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"O, let my sovereign turn away his face"
78518,78519,Richard II,16.0,1.1.112,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And bid his ears a little while be deaf,"
78519,78520,Richard II,16.0,1.1.113,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Till I have told this slander of his blood,"
78520,78521,Richard II,16.0,1.1.114,THOMAS MOWBRAY,How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
78521,78522,Richard II,17.0,1.1.115,KING RICHARD II,"Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:"
78522,78523,Richard II,17.0,1.1.116,KING RICHARD II,"Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,"
78523,78524,Richard II,17.0,1.1.117,KING RICHARD II,"As he is but my father's brother's son,"
78524,78525,Richard II,17.0,1.1.118,KING RICHARD II,"Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,"
78525,78526,Richard II,17.0,1.1.119,KING RICHARD II,Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
78526,78527,Richard II,17.0,1.1.120,KING RICHARD II,"Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize"
78527,78528,Richard II,17.0,1.1.121,KING RICHARD II,The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
78528,78529,Richard II,17.0,1.1.122,KING RICHARD II,"He is our subject, Mowbray, so art thou:"
78529,78530,Richard II,17.0,1.1.123,KING RICHARD II,Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
78530,78531,Richard II,18.0,1.1.124,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,"
78531,78532,Richard II,18.0,1.1.125,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest."
78532,78533,Richard II,18.0,1.1.126,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
78533,78534,Richard II,18.0,1.1.127,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers,"
78534,78535,Richard II,18.0,1.1.128,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The other part reserved I by consent,"
78535,78536,Richard II,18.0,1.1.129,THOMAS MOWBRAY,For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
78536,78537,Richard II,18.0,1.1.130,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Upon remainder of a dear account,"
78537,78538,Richard II,18.0,1.1.131,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
78538,78539,Richard II,18.0,1.1.132,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,"
78539,78540,Richard II,18.0,1.1.133,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I slew him not, but to my own disgrace"
78540,78541,Richard II,18.0,1.1.134,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
78541,78542,Richard II,18.0,1.1.135,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,"
78542,78543,Richard II,18.0,1.1.136,THOMAS MOWBRAY,The honourable father to my foe
78543,78544,Richard II,18.0,1.1.137,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Once did I lay an ambush for your life,"
78544,78545,Richard II,18.0,1.1.138,THOMAS MOWBRAY,A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
78545,78546,Richard II,18.0,1.1.139,THOMAS MOWBRAY,But ere I last received the sacrament
78546,78547,Richard II,18.0,1.1.140,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I did confess it, and exactly begg'd"
78547,78548,Richard II,18.0,1.1.141,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it."
78548,78549,Richard II,18.0,1.1.142,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,"
78549,78550,Richard II,18.0,1.1.143,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"It issues from the rancour of a villain,"
78550,78551,Richard II,18.0,1.1.144,THOMAS MOWBRAY,A recreant and most degenerate traitor
78551,78552,Richard II,18.0,1.1.145,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Which in myself I boldly will defend,"
78552,78553,Richard II,18.0,1.1.146,THOMAS MOWBRAY,And interchangeably hurl down my gage
78553,78554,Richard II,18.0,1.1.147,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Upon this overweening traitor's foot,"
78554,78555,Richard II,18.0,1.1.148,THOMAS MOWBRAY,To prove myself a loyal gentleman
78555,78556,Richard II,18.0,1.1.149,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
78556,78557,Richard II,18.0,1.1.150,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"In haste whereof, most heartily I pray"
78557,78558,Richard II,18.0,1.1.151,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Your highness to assign our trial day.
78558,78559,Richard II,19.0,1.1.152,KING RICHARD II,"Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me,"
78559,78560,Richard II,19.0,1.1.153,KING RICHARD II,Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
78560,78561,Richard II,19.0,1.1.154,KING RICHARD II,"This we prescribe, though no physician,"
78561,78562,Richard II,19.0,1.1.155,KING RICHARD II,"Deep malice makes too deep incision,"
78562,78563,Richard II,19.0,1.1.156,KING RICHARD II,"Forget, forgive, conclude and be agreed,"
78563,78564,Richard II,19.0,1.1.157,KING RICHARD II,Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
78564,78565,Richard II,19.0,1.1.158,KING RICHARD II,"Good uncle, let this end where it begun,"
78565,78566,Richard II,19.0,1.1.159,KING RICHARD II,"We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son."
78566,78567,Richard II,20.0,1.1.160,JOHN OF GAUNT,To be a make-peace shall become my age:
78567,78568,Richard II,20.0,1.1.161,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage."
78568,78569,Richard II,21.0,1.1.162,KING RICHARD II,"And, Norfolk, throw down his."
78569,78570,Richard II,22.0,1.1.163,JOHN OF GAUNT,"When, Harry, when?"
78570,78571,Richard II,22.0,1.1.164,JOHN OF GAUNT,Obedience bids I should not bid again.
78571,78572,Richard II,23.0,1.1.165,KING RICHARD II,"Norfolk, throw down, we bid, there is no boot."
78572,78573,Richard II,24.0,1.1.166,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot."
78573,78574,Richard II,24.0,1.1.167,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:"
78574,78575,Richard II,24.0,1.1.168,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The one my duty owes, but my fair name,"
78575,78576,Richard II,24.0,1.1.169,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Despite of death that lives upon my grave,"
78576,78577,Richard II,24.0,1.1.170,THOMAS MOWBRAY,To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
78577,78578,Richard II,24.0,1.1.171,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,"
78578,78579,Richard II,24.0,1.1.172,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,"
78579,78580,Richard II,24.0,1.1.173,THOMAS MOWBRAY,The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
78580,78581,Richard II,24.0,1.1.174,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Which breathed this poison.
78581,78582,Richard II,25.0,1.1.175,KING RICHARD II,Rage must be withstood:
78582,78583,Richard II,25.0,1.1.176,KING RICHARD II,Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
78583,78584,Richard II,26.0,1.1.177,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame."
78584,78585,Richard II,26.0,1.1.178,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,"
78585,78586,Richard II,26.0,1.1.179,THOMAS MOWBRAY,The purest treasure mortal times afford
78586,78587,Richard II,26.0,1.1.180,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Is spotless reputation: that away,"
78587,78588,Richard II,26.0,1.1.181,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
78588,78589,Richard II,26.0,1.1.182,THOMAS MOWBRAY,A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
78589,78590,Richard II,26.0,1.1.183,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
78590,78591,Richard II,26.0,1.1.184,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Mine honour is my life, both grow in one:"
78591,78592,Richard II,26.0,1.1.185,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Take honour from me, and my life is done:"

78596,78597,Richard II,28.0,1.1.190,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
78597,78598,Richard II,28.0,1.1.191,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
78598,78599,Richard II,28.0,1.1.192,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
78599,78600,Richard II,28.0,1.1.193,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,"
78600,78601,Richard II,28.0,1.1.194,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear"
78601,78602,Richard II,28.0,1.1.195,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The slavish motive of recanting fear,"
78602,78603,Richard II,28.0,1.1.196,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,"
78603,78604,Richard II,28.0,1.1.197,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face."
78604,78605,Richard II,28.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Exit JOHN OF GAUNT
78605,78606,Richard II,29.0,1.1.198,KING RICHARD II,"We were not born to sue, but to command,"

78607,78608,Richard II,29.0,1.1.200,KING RICHARD II,"Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,"
78608,78609,Richard II,29.0,1.1.201,KING RICHARD II,"At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:"
78609,78610,Richard II,29.0,1.1.202,KING RICHARD II,There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
78610,78611,Richard II,29.0,1.1.203,KING RICHARD II,The swelling difference of your settled hate:
78611,78612,Richard II,29.0,1.1.204,KING RICHARD II,"Since we can not atone you, we shall see"
78612,78613,Richard II,29.0,1.1.205,KING RICHARD II,Justice design the victor's chivalry.
78613,78614,Richard II,29.0,1.1.206,KING RICHARD II,"Lord marshal, command our officers at arms"
78614,78615,Richard II,29.0,1.1.207,KING RICHARD II,Be ready to direct these home alarms.

78618,78619,Richard II,1.0,1.2.1,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood"
78619,78620,Richard II,1.0,1.2.2,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,"
78620,78621,Richard II,1.0,1.2.3,JOHN OF GAUNT,To stir against the butchers of his life!
78621,78622,Richard II,1.0,1.2.4,JOHN OF GAUNT,But since correction lieth in those hands
78622,78623,Richard II,1.0,1.2.5,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Which made the fault that we cannot correct,"
78623,78624,Richard II,1.0,1.2.6,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,"
78624,78625,Richard II,1.0,1.2.7,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,"
78625,78626,Richard II,1.0,1.2.8,JOHN OF GAUNT,Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
78626,78627,Richard II,2.0,1.2.9,DUCHESS,Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
78627,78628,Richard II,2.0,1.2.10,DUCHESS,Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
78628,78629,Richard II,2.0,1.2.11,DUCHESS,"Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,"
78629,78630,Richard II,2.0,1.2.12,DUCHESS,"Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,"
78630,78631,Richard II,2.0,1.2.13,DUCHESS,Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
78631,78632,Richard II,2.0,1.2.14,DUCHESS,"Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,"
78632,78633,Richard II,2.0,1.2.15,DUCHESS,"Some of those branches by the Destinies cut,"
78633,78634,Richard II,2.0,1.2.16,DUCHESS,"But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,"
78634,78635,Richard II,2.0,1.2.17,DUCHESS,"One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,"
78635,78636,Richard II,2.0,1.2.18,DUCHESS,"One flourishing branch of his most royal root,"
78636,78637,Richard II,2.0,1.2.19,DUCHESS,"Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,"
78637,78638,Richard II,2.0,1.2.20,DUCHESS,"Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,"
78638,78639,Richard II,2.0,1.2.21,DUCHESS,By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
78639,78640,Richard II,2.0,1.2.22,DUCHESS,"Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,"
78640,78641,Richard II,2.0,1.2.23,DUCHESS,"That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee"
78641,78642,Richard II,2.0,1.2.24,DUCHESS,"Made him a man, and though thou livest and breathest,"
78642,78643,Richard II,2.0,1.2.25,DUCHESS,Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
78643,78644,Richard II,2.0,1.2.26,DUCHESS,"In some large measure to thy father's death,"
78644,78645,Richard II,2.0,1.2.27,DUCHESS,"In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,"
78645,78646,Richard II,2.0,1.2.28,DUCHESS,Who was the model of thy father's life.
78646,78647,Richard II,2.0,1.2.29,DUCHESS,"Call it not patience, Gaunt, it is despair:"
78647,78648,Richard II,2.0,1.2.30,DUCHESS,"In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,"
78648,78649,Richard II,2.0,1.2.31,DUCHESS,"Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,"
78649,78650,Richard II,2.0,1.2.32,DUCHESS,Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
78650,78651,Richard II,2.0,1.2.33,DUCHESS,That which in mean men we intitle patience
78651,78652,Richard II,2.0,1.2.34,DUCHESS,Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
78652,78653,Richard II,2.0,1.2.35,DUCHESS,"What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,"
78653,78654,Richard II,2.0,1.2.36,DUCHESS,The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
78654,78655,Richard II,3.0,1.2.37,JOHN OF GAUNT,"God's is the quarrel, for God's substitute,"
78655,78656,Richard II,3.0,1.2.38,JOHN OF GAUNT,"His deputy anointed in His sight,"
78656,78657,Richard II,3.0,1.2.39,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,"
78657,78658,Richard II,3.0,1.2.40,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift"
78658,78659,Richard II,3.0,1.2.41,JOHN OF GAUNT,An angry arm against His minister.
78659,78660,Richard II,4.0,1.2.42,DUCHESS,"Where then, alas, may I complain myself?"
78660,78661,Richard II,5.0,1.2.43,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To God, the widow's champion and defence."
78661,78662,Richard II,6.0,1.2.44,DUCHESS,"Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt."
78662,78663,Richard II,6.0,1.2.45,DUCHESS,"Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold"
78663,78664,Richard II,6.0,1.2.46,DUCHESS,Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
78664,78665,Richard II,6.0,1.2.47,DUCHESS,"O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,"
78665,78666,Richard II,6.0,1.2.48,DUCHESS,That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
78666,78667,Richard II,6.0,1.2.49,DUCHESS,"Or, if misfortune miss the first career,"
78667,78668,Richard II,6.0,1.2.50,DUCHESS,"Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,"
78668,78669,Richard II,6.0,1.2.51,DUCHESS,"They may break his foaming courser's back,"
78669,78670,Richard II,6.0,1.2.52,DUCHESS,"And throw the rider headlong in the lists,"
78670,78671,Richard II,6.0,1.2.53,DUCHESS,A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
78671,78672,Richard II,6.0,1.2.54,DUCHESS,"Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife"
78672,78673,Richard II,6.0,1.2.55,DUCHESS,With her companion grief must end her life.
78673,78674,Richard II,7.0,1.2.56,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Sister, farewell, I must to Coventry:"
78674,78675,Richard II,7.0,1.2.57,JOHN OF GAUNT,As much good stay with thee as go with me!
78675,78676,Richard II,8.0,1.2.58,DUCHESS,"Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,"
78676,78677,Richard II,8.0,1.2.59,DUCHESS,"Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:"
78677,78678,Richard II,8.0,1.2.60,DUCHESS,"I take my leave before I have begun,"
78678,78679,Richard II,8.0,1.2.61,DUCHESS,For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
78679,78680,Richard II,8.0,1.2.62,DUCHESS,"Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York."
78680,78681,Richard II,8.0,1.2.63,DUCHESS,"Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so,"
78681,78682,Richard II,8.0,1.2.64,DUCHESS,"Though this be all, do not so quickly go,"
78682,78683,Richard II,8.0,1.2.65,DUCHESS,"I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--"
78683,78684,Richard II,8.0,1.2.66,DUCHESS,With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
78684,78685,Richard II,8.0,1.2.67,DUCHESS,"Alack, and what shall good old York there see"
78685,78686,Richard II,8.0,1.2.68,DUCHESS,"But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,"
78686,78687,Richard II,8.0,1.2.69,DUCHESS,"Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?"
78687,78688,Richard II,8.0,1.2.70,DUCHESS,And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
78688,78689,Richard II,8.0,1.2.71,DUCHESS,"Therefore commend me, let him not come there,"
78689,78690,Richard II,8.0,1.2.72,DUCHESS,To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
78690,78691,Richard II,8.0,1.2.73,DUCHESS,"Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:"
78691,78692,Richard II,8.0,1.2.74,DUCHESS,The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

78759,78760,Richard II,15.0,1.3.63,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My loving lord, I take my leave of you,"
78760,78761,Richard II,15.0,1.3.64,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle,"
78761,78762,Richard II,15.0,1.3.65,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Not sick, although I have to do with death,"
78762,78763,Richard II,15.0,1.3.66,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath."
78763,78764,Richard II,15.0,1.3.67,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet"
78764,78765,Richard II,15.0,1.3.68,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:"
78765,78766,Richard II,15.0,1.3.69,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O thou, the earthly author of my blood,"
78766,78767,Richard II,15.0,1.3.70,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,"
78767,78768,Richard II,15.0,1.3.71,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
78768,78769,Richard II,15.0,1.3.72,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To reach at victory above my head,"
78769,78770,Richard II,15.0,1.3.73,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,"
78770,78771,Richard II,15.0,1.3.74,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,"
78771,78772,Richard II,15.0,1.3.75,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,"
78772,78773,Richard II,15.0,1.3.76,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,"
78773,78774,Richard II,15.0,1.3.77,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Even in the lusty havior of his son.
78774,78775,Richard II,16.0,1.3.78,JOHN OF GAUNT,God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
78775,78776,Richard II,16.0,1.3.79,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Be swift like lightning in the execution,"
78776,78777,Richard II,16.0,1.3.80,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,"
78777,78778,Richard II,16.0,1.3.81,JOHN OF GAUNT,Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
78778,78779,Richard II,16.0,1.3.82,JOHN OF GAUNT,Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
78779,78780,Richard II,16.0,1.3.83,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live."
78780,78781,Richard II,17.0,1.3.84,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
78781,78782,Richard II,18.0,1.3.85,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"However God or fortune cast my lot,"
78782,78783,Richard II,18.0,1.3.86,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,"
78783,78784,Richard II,18.0,1.3.87,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A loyal, just and upright gentleman:"
78784,78785,Richard II,18.0,1.3.88,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Never did captive with a freer heart
78785,78786,Richard II,18.0,1.3.89,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
78786,78787,Richard II,18.0,1.3.90,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,"
78787,78788,Richard II,18.0,1.3.91,THOMAS MOWBRAY,More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
78788,78789,Richard II,18.0,1.3.92,THOMAS MOWBRAY,This feast of battle with mine adversary.
78789,78790,Richard II,18.0,1.3.93,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,"
78790,78791,Richard II,18.0,1.3.94,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
78791,78792,Richard II,18.0,1.3.95,THOMAS MOWBRAY,As gentle and as jocund as to jest
78792,78793,Richard II,18.0,1.3.96,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
78793,78794,Richard II,19.0,1.3.97,KING RICHARD II,"Farewell, my lord: securely I espy"
78794,78795,Richard II,19.0,1.3.98,KING RICHARD II,Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
78795,78796,Richard II,19.0,1.3.99,KING RICHARD II,"Order the trial, marshal, and begin."
78796,78797,Richard II,20.0,1.3.100,Lord Marshal,"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"
78797,78798,Richard II,20.0,1.3.101,Lord Marshal,"Receive thy lance, and God defend the right!"
78798,78799,Richard II,21.0,1.3.102,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen."
78799,78800,Richard II,22.0,1.3.103,Lord Marshal,"Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk."
78800,78801,Richard II,23.0,1.3.104,First Herald,"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,"
78801,78802,Richard II,23.0,1.3.105,First Herald,"Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,"
78802,78803,Richard II,23.0,1.3.106,First Herald,"On pain to be found false and recreant,"
78803,78804,Richard II,23.0,1.3.107,First Herald,"To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,"
78804,78805,Richard II,23.0,1.3.108,First Herald,"A traitor to his God, his king and him,"
78805,78806,Richard II,23.0,1.3.109,First Herald,And dares him to set forward to the fight.
78806,78807,Richard II,24.0,1.3.110,Second Herald,"Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,"
78807,78808,Richard II,24.0,1.3.111,Second Herald,"On pain to be found false and recreant,"
78808,78809,Richard II,24.0,1.3.112,Second Herald,Both to defend himself and to approve
78809,78810,Richard II,24.0,1.3.113,Second Herald,"Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,"
78810,78811,Richard II,24.0,1.3.114,Second Herald,"To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal,"
78811,78812,Richard II,24.0,1.3.115,Second Herald,Courageously and with a free desire
78812,78813,Richard II,24.0,1.3.116,Second Herald,Attending but the signal to begin.
78813,78814,Richard II,25.0,1.3.117,Lord Marshal,"Sound, trumpets, and set forward, combatants."
78814,78815,Richard II,25.0,,Lord Marshal,A charge sounded
78815,78816,Richard II,25.0,1.3.118,Lord Marshal,"Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down."
78816,78817,Richard II,26.0,1.3.119,KING RICHARD II,"Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,"
78817,78818,Richard II,26.0,1.3.120,KING RICHARD II,And both return back to their chairs again:
78818,78819,Richard II,26.0,1.3.121,KING RICHARD II,Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
78819,78820,Richard II,26.0,1.3.122,KING RICHARD II,While we return these dukes what we decree.
78820,78821,Richard II,26.0,,KING RICHARD II,A long flourish
78821,78822,Richard II,26.0,1.3.123,KING RICHARD II,"Draw near,"
78822,78823,Richard II,26.0,1.3.124,KING RICHARD II,And list what with our council we have done.
78823,78824,Richard II,26.0,1.3.125,KING RICHARD II,For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
78824,78825,Richard II,26.0,1.3.126,KING RICHARD II,"With that dear blood which it hath fostered,"
78825,78826,Richard II,26.0,1.3.127,KING RICHARD II,And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
78826,78827,Richard II,26.0,1.3.128,KING RICHARD II,"Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword,"
78827,78828,Richard II,26.0,1.3.129,KING RICHARD II,And for we think the eagle-winged pride
78828,78829,Richard II,26.0,1.3.130,KING RICHARD II,"Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,"
78829,78830,Richard II,26.0,1.3.131,KING RICHARD II,"With rival-hating envy, set on you"
78830,78831,Richard II,26.0,1.3.132,KING RICHARD II,"To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle"
78831,78832,Richard II,26.0,1.3.133,KING RICHARD II,"Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep,"
78832,78833,Richard II,26.0,1.3.134,KING RICHARD II,"Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,"
78833,78834,Richard II,26.0,1.3.135,KING RICHARD II,"With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,"
78834,78835,Richard II,26.0,1.3.136,KING RICHARD II,"And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,"
78835,78836,Richard II,26.0,1.3.137,KING RICHARD II,Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
78836,78837,Richard II,26.0,1.3.138,KING RICHARD II,"And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,"
78837,78838,Richard II,26.0,1.3.139,KING RICHARD II,"Therefore, we banish you our territories:"
78838,78839,Richard II,26.0,1.3.140,KING RICHARD II,"You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,"
78839,78840,Richard II,26.0,1.3.141,KING RICHARD II,Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
78840,78841,Richard II,26.0,1.3.142,KING RICHARD II,"Shall not regreet our fair dominions,"
78841,78842,Richard II,26.0,1.3.143,KING RICHARD II,But tread the stranger paths of banishment.
78842,78843,Richard II,27.0,1.3.144,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Your will be done: this must my comfort be,"
78843,78844,Richard II,27.0,1.3.145,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Sun that warms you here shall shine on me,"
78844,78845,Richard II,27.0,1.3.146,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And those his golden beams to you here lent
78845,78846,Richard II,27.0,1.3.147,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
78846,78847,Richard II,28.0,1.3.148,KING RICHARD II,"Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,"
78847,78848,Richard II,28.0,1.3.149,KING RICHARD II,Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
78848,78849,Richard II,28.0,1.3.150,KING RICHARD II,The sly slow hours shall not determinate
78849,78850,Richard II,28.0,1.3.151,KING RICHARD II,"The dateless limit of thy dear exile,"
78850,78851,Richard II,28.0,1.3.152,KING RICHARD II,The hopeless word of 'never to return'
78851,78852,Richard II,28.0,1.3.153,KING RICHARD II,"Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life."
78852,78853,Richard II,29.0,1.3.154,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,"
78853,78854,Richard II,29.0,1.3.155,THOMAS MOWBRAY,And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
78854,78855,Richard II,29.0,1.3.156,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"A dearer merit, not so deep a maim"
78855,78856,Richard II,29.0,1.3.157,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"As to be cast forth in the common air,"
78856,78857,Richard II,29.0,1.3.158,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
78857,78858,Richard II,29.0,1.3.159,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"The language I have learn'd these forty years,"
78858,78859,Richard II,29.0,1.3.160,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"My native English, now I must forego:"
78859,78860,Richard II,29.0,1.3.161,THOMAS MOWBRAY,And now my tongue's use is to me no more
78860,78861,Richard II,29.0,1.3.162,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Than an unstringed viol or a harp,"
78861,78862,Richard II,29.0,1.3.163,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Or like a cunning instrument cased up,"
78862,78863,Richard II,29.0,1.3.164,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Or, being open, put into his hands"
78863,78864,Richard II,29.0,1.3.165,THOMAS MOWBRAY,That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
78864,78865,Richard II,29.0,1.3.166,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,"
78865,78866,Richard II,29.0,1.3.167,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips,"
78866,78867,Richard II,29.0,1.3.168,THOMAS MOWBRAY,And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
78867,78868,Richard II,29.0,1.3.169,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
78868,78869,Richard II,29.0,1.3.170,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,"
78869,78870,Richard II,29.0,1.3.171,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Too far in years to be a pupil now:
78870,78871,Richard II,29.0,1.3.172,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"What is thy sentence then but speechless death,"
78871,78872,Richard II,29.0,1.3.173,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
78872,78873,Richard II,30.0,1.3.174,KING RICHARD II,It boots thee not to be compassionate:
78873,78874,Richard II,30.0,1.3.175,KING RICHARD II,After our sentence plaining comes too late.
78874,78875,Richard II,31.0,1.3.176,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Then thus I turn me from my country's light,"
78875,78876,Richard II,31.0,1.3.177,THOMAS MOWBRAY,To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.
78876,78877,Richard II,32.0,1.3.178,KING RICHARD II,"Return again, and take an oath with thee."
78877,78878,Richard II,32.0,1.3.179,KING RICHARD II,"Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands,"
78878,78879,Richard II,32.0,1.3.180,KING RICHARD II,Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
78879,78880,Richard II,32.0,1.3.181,KING RICHARD II,Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
78880,78881,Richard II,32.0,1.3.182,KING RICHARD II,To keep the oath that we administer:
78881,78882,Richard II,32.0,1.3.183,KING RICHARD II,"You never shall, so help you truth and God!"
78882,78883,Richard II,32.0,1.3.184,KING RICHARD II,"Embrace each other's love in banishment,"
78883,78884,Richard II,32.0,1.3.185,KING RICHARD II,"Nor never look upon each other's face,"
78884,78885,Richard II,32.0,1.3.186,KING RICHARD II,"Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile"
78885,78886,Richard II,32.0,1.3.187,KING RICHARD II,"This louring tempest of your home-bred hate,"
78886,78887,Richard II,32.0,1.3.188,KING RICHARD II,Nor never by advised purpose meet
78887,78888,Richard II,32.0,1.3.189,KING RICHARD II,"To plot, contrive, or complot any ill"
78888,78889,Richard II,32.0,1.3.190,KING RICHARD II,"'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land."
78889,78890,Richard II,33.0,1.3.191,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,I swear.
78890,78891,Richard II,34.0,1.3.192,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And I, to keep all this."
78891,78892,Richard II,35.0,1.3.193,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--"
78892,78893,Richard II,35.0,1.3.194,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By this time, had the king permitted us,"
78893,78894,Richard II,35.0,1.3.195,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
78894,78895,Richard II,35.0,1.3.196,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,"
78895,78896,Richard II,35.0,1.3.197,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
78896,78897,Richard II,35.0,1.3.198,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm,"
78897,78898,Richard II,35.0,1.3.199,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Since thou hast far to go, bear not along"
78898,78899,Richard II,35.0,1.3.200,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.
78899,78900,Richard II,36.0,1.3.201,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,"
78900,78901,Richard II,36.0,1.3.202,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"My name be blotted from the book of life,"
78901,78902,Richard II,36.0,1.3.203,THOMAS MOWBRAY,And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
78902,78903,Richard II,36.0,1.3.204,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know,"
78903,78904,Richard II,36.0,1.3.205,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue."
78904,78905,Richard II,36.0,1.3.206,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray,"
78905,78906,Richard II,36.0,1.3.207,THOMAS MOWBRAY,"Save back to England, all the world's my way."
78906,78907,Richard II,36.0,,THOMAS MOWBRAY,Exit
78907,78908,Richard II,37.0,1.3.208,KING RICHARD II,"Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes"
78908,78909,Richard II,37.0,1.3.209,KING RICHARD II,I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
78909,78910,Richard II,37.0,1.3.210,KING RICHARD II,Hath from the number of his banish'd years
78910,78911,Richard II,37.0,1.3.211,KING RICHARD II,Pluck'd four away.
78911,78912,Richard II,37.0,,KING RICHARD II,To HENRY BOLINGBROKE
78912,78913,Richard II,37.0,1.3.212,KING RICHARD II,"Six frozen winter spent,"
78913,78914,Richard II,37.0,1.3.213,KING RICHARD II,Return with welcome home from banishment.
78914,78915,Richard II,38.0,1.3.214,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,How long a time lies in one little word!
78915,78916,Richard II,38.0,1.3.215,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
78916,78917,Richard II,38.0,1.3.216,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
78917,78918,Richard II,39.0,1.3.217,JOHN OF GAUNT,"I thank my liege, that in regard of me"
78918,78919,Richard II,39.0,1.3.218,JOHN OF GAUNT,He shortens four years of my son's exile:
78919,78920,Richard II,39.0,1.3.219,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But little vantage shall I reap thereby,"
78920,78921,Richard II,39.0,1.3.220,JOHN OF GAUNT,"For, ere the six years that he hath to spend"
78921,78922,Richard II,39.0,1.3.221,JOHN OF GAUNT,Can change their moons and bring their times about
78922,78923,Richard II,39.0,1.3.222,JOHN OF GAUNT,My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
78923,78924,Richard II,39.0,1.3.223,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Shall be extinct with age and endless night,"
78924,78925,Richard II,39.0,1.3.224,JOHN OF GAUNT,"My inch of taper will be burnt and done,"
78925,78926,Richard II,39.0,1.3.225,JOHN OF GAUNT,And blindfold death not let me see my son.
78926,78927,Richard II,40.0,1.3.226,KING RICHARD II,"Why uncle, thou hast many years to live."
78927,78928,Richard II,41.0,1.3.227,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:"
78928,78929,Richard II,41.0,1.3.228,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,"
78929,78930,Richard II,41.0,1.3.229,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow,"
78930,78931,Richard II,41.0,1.3.230,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,"
78931,78932,Richard II,41.0,1.3.231,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage,"
78932,78933,Richard II,41.0,1.3.232,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Thy word is current with him for my death,"
78933,78934,Richard II,41.0,1.3.233,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath."
78934,78935,Richard II,42.0,1.3.234,KING RICHARD II,"Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,"
78935,78936,Richard II,42.0,1.3.235,KING RICHARD II,Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
78936,78937,Richard II,42.0,1.3.236,KING RICHARD II,Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?
78937,78938,Richard II,43.0,1.3.237,JOHN OF GAUNT,Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
78938,78939,Richard II,43.0,1.3.238,JOHN OF GAUNT,"You urged me as a judge, but I had rather"
78939,78940,Richard II,43.0,1.3.239,JOHN OF GAUNT,You would have bid me argue like a father.
78940,78941,Richard II,43.0,1.3.240,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, had it been a stranger, not my child,"
78941,78942,Richard II,43.0,1.3.241,JOHN OF GAUNT,To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
78942,78943,Richard II,43.0,1.3.242,JOHN OF GAUNT,"A partial slander sought I to avoid,"
78943,78944,Richard II,43.0,1.3.243,JOHN OF GAUNT,And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
78944,78945,Richard II,43.0,1.3.244,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,"
78945,78946,Richard II,43.0,1.3.245,JOHN OF GAUNT,"I was too strict to make mine own away,"
78946,78947,Richard II,43.0,1.3.246,JOHN OF GAUNT,But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
78947,78948,Richard II,43.0,1.3.247,JOHN OF GAUNT,Against my will to do myself this wrong.
78948,78949,Richard II,44.0,1.3.248,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin, farewell, and, uncle, bid him so:"
78949,78950,Richard II,44.0,1.3.249,KING RICHARD II,"Six years we banish him, and he shall go."

78954,78955,Richard II,46.0,1.3.253,Lord Marshal,"As far as land will let me, by your side."
78955,78956,Richard II,47.0,1.3.254,JOHN OF GAUNT,"O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,"
78956,78957,Richard II,47.0,1.3.255,JOHN OF GAUNT,That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
78957,78958,Richard II,48.0,1.3.256,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I have too few to take my leave of you,"
78958,78959,Richard II,48.0,1.3.257,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,When the tongue's office should be prodigal
78959,78960,Richard II,48.0,1.3.258,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
78960,78961,Richard II,49.0,1.3.259,JOHN OF GAUNT,Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
78961,78962,Richard II,50.0,1.3.260,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Joy absent, grief is present for that time."
78962,78963,Richard II,51.0,1.3.261,JOHN OF GAUNT,What is six winters? they are quickly gone.
78963,78964,Richard II,52.0,1.3.262,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To men in joy, but grief makes one hour ten."
78964,78965,Richard II,53.0,1.3.263,JOHN OF GAUNT,Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
78965,78966,Richard II,54.0,1.3.264,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,"
78966,78967,Richard II,54.0,1.3.265,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.
78967,78968,Richard II,55.0,1.3.266,JOHN OF GAUNT,The sullen passage of thy weary steps
78968,78969,Richard II,55.0,1.3.267,JOHN OF GAUNT,Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
78969,78970,Richard II,55.0,1.3.268,JOHN OF GAUNT,The precious jewel of thy home return.
78970,78971,Richard II,56.0,1.3.269,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make"
78971,78972,Richard II,56.0,1.3.270,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Will but remember me what a deal of world
78972,78973,Richard II,56.0,1.3.271,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,I wander from the jewels that I love.
78973,78974,Richard II,56.0,1.3.272,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
78974,78975,Richard II,56.0,1.3.273,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To foreign passages, and in the end,"
78975,78976,Richard II,56.0,1.3.274,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Having my freedom, boast of nothing else"
78976,78977,Richard II,56.0,1.3.275,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,But that I was a journeyman to grief?
78977,78978,Richard II,57.0,1.3.276,JOHN OF GAUNT,All places that the eye of heaven visits
78978,78979,Richard II,57.0,1.3.277,JOHN OF GAUNT,Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
78979,78980,Richard II,57.0,1.3.278,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Teach thy necessity to reason thus,"
78980,78981,Richard II,57.0,1.3.279,JOHN OF GAUNT,There is no virtue like necessity.
78981,78982,Richard II,57.0,1.3.280,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Think not the king did banish thee,"
78982,78983,Richard II,57.0,1.3.281,JOHN OF GAUNT,"But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,"
78983,78984,Richard II,57.0,1.3.282,JOHN OF GAUNT,Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
78984,78985,Richard II,57.0,1.3.283,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour"
78985,78986,Richard II,57.0,1.3.284,JOHN OF GAUNT,"And not the king exiled thee, or suppose"
78986,78987,Richard II,57.0,1.3.285,JOHN OF GAUNT,Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
78987,78988,Richard II,57.0,1.3.286,JOHN OF GAUNT,And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
78988,78989,Richard II,57.0,1.3.287,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it"
78989,78990,Richard II,57.0,1.3.288,JOHN OF GAUNT,"To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:"
78990,78991,Richard II,57.0,1.3.289,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Suppose the singing birds musicians,"
78991,78992,Richard II,57.0,1.3.290,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,"
78992,78993,Richard II,57.0,1.3.291,JOHN OF GAUNT,"The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more"
78993,78994,Richard II,57.0,1.3.292,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Than a delightful measure or a dance,"
78994,78995,Richard II,57.0,1.3.293,JOHN OF GAUNT,For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
78995,78996,Richard II,57.0,1.3.294,JOHN OF GAUNT,The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
78996,78997,Richard II,58.0,1.3.295,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O, who can hold a fire in his hand"
78997,78998,Richard II,58.0,1.3.296,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
78998,78999,Richard II,58.0,1.3.297,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
78999,79000,Richard II,58.0,1.3.298,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,By bare imagination of a feast?
79000,79001,Richard II,58.0,1.3.299,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Or wallow naked in December snow
79001,79002,Richard II,58.0,1.3.300,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
79002,79003,Richard II,58.0,1.3.301,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"O, no! the apprehension of the good"
79003,79004,Richard II,58.0,1.3.302,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
79004,79005,Richard II,58.0,1.3.303,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
79005,79006,Richard II,58.0,1.3.304,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore."
79006,79007,Richard II,59.0,1.3.305,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:"
79007,79008,Richard II,59.0,1.3.306,JOHN OF GAUNT,"Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay."
79008,79009,Richard II,60.0,1.3.307,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Then, England's ground, farewell, sweet soil, adieu,"
79009,79010,Richard II,60.0,1.3.308,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!"
79010,79011,Richard II,60.0,1.3.309,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,"

79019,79020,Richard II,3.0,1.4.5,KING RICHARD II,"And say, what store of parting tears were shed?"
79020,79021,Richard II,4.0,1.4.6,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Faith, none for me, except the north-east wind,"
79021,79022,Richard II,4.0,1.4.7,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Which then blew bitterly against our faces,"
79022,79023,Richard II,4.0,1.4.8,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance"
79023,79024,Richard II,4.0,1.4.9,DUKE OF AUMERLE,Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

79029,79030,Richard II,6.0,1.4.15,DUKE OF AUMERLE,That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.

79291,79292,Richard II,30.0,2.1.204,DUKE OF YORK,Call in the letters patent that he hath
79292,79293,Richard II,30.0,2.1.205,DUKE OF YORK,By his attorneys-general to sue
79293,79294,Richard II,30.0,2.1.206,DUKE OF YORK,"His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,"
79294,79295,Richard II,30.0,2.1.207,DUKE OF YORK,"You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,"
79295,79296,Richard II,30.0,2.1.208,DUKE OF YORK,You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
79296,79297,Richard II,30.0,2.1.209,DUKE OF YORK,"And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts"
79297,79298,Richard II,30.0,2.1.210,DUKE OF YORK,Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
79298,79299,Richard II,31.0,2.1.211,KING RICHARD II,"Think what you will, we seize into our hands"
79299,79300,Richard II,31.0,2.1.212,KING RICHARD II,"His plate, his goods, his money and his lands."
79300,79301,Richard II,32.0,2.1.213,DUKE OF YORK,"I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:"
79301,79302,Richard II,32.0,2.1.214,DUKE OF YORK,"What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell,"
79302,79303,Richard II,32.0,2.1.215,DUKE OF YORK,But by bad courses may be understood
79303,79304,Richard II,32.0,2.1.216,DUKE OF YORK,That their events can never fall out good.
79304,79305,Richard II,32.0,,DUKE OF YORK,Exit
79305,79306,Richard II,33.0,2.1.217,KING RICHARD II,"Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:"
79306,79307,Richard II,33.0,2.1.218,KING RICHARD II,Bid him repair to us to Ely House
79307,79308,Richard II,33.0,2.1.219,KING RICHARD II,To see this business. To-morrow next
79308,79309,Richard II,33.0,2.1.220,KING RICHARD II,"We will for Ireland, and 'tis time, I trow:"
79309,79310,Richard II,33.0,2.1.221,KING RICHARD II,"And we create, in absence of ourself,"
79310,79311,Richard II,33.0,2.1.222,KING RICHARD II,"Our uncle York lord governor of England,"
79311,79312,Richard II,33.0,2.1.223,KING RICHARD II,For he is just and always loved us well.
79312,79313,Richard II,33.0,2.1.224,KING RICHARD II,"Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part,"
79313,79314,Richard II,33.0,2.1.225,KING RICHARD II,"Be merry, for our time of stay is short"
79314,79315,Richard II,33.0,,KING RICHARD II,"Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II, QUEEN, DUKE OF AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, and BAGOT"
79315,79316,Richard II,34.0,2.1.226,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead."
79316,79317,Richard II,35.0,2.1.227,LORD ROSS,"And living too, for now his son is duke."
79317,79318,Richard II,36.0,2.1.228,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Barely in title, not in revenue."
79318,79319,Richard II,37.0,2.1.229,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Richly in both, if justice had her right."
79319,79320,Richard II,38.0,2.1.230,LORD ROSS,"My heart is great, but it must break with silence,"
79320,79321,Richard II,38.0,2.1.231,LORD ROSS,Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.
79321,79322,Richard II,39.0,2.1.232,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Nay, speak thy mind, and let him ne'er speak more"
79322,79323,Richard II,39.0,2.1.233,NORTHUMBERLAND,That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
79323,79324,Richard II,40.0,2.1.234,LORD WILLOUGHBY,Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
79324,79325,Richard II,40.0,2.1.235,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"If it be so, out with it boldly, man,"
79325,79326,Richard II,40.0,2.1.236,LORD WILLOUGHBY,Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
79326,79327,Richard II,41.0,2.1.237,LORD ROSS,"No good at all that I can do for him,"
79327,79328,Richard II,41.0,2.1.238,LORD ROSS,"Unless you call it good to pity him,"
79328,79329,Richard II,41.0,2.1.239,LORD ROSS,Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
79329,79330,Richard II,42.0,2.1.240,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne"
79330,79331,Richard II,42.0,2.1.241,NORTHUMBERLAND,"In him, a royal prince, and many moe"
79331,79332,Richard II,42.0,2.1.242,NORTHUMBERLAND,Of noble blood in this declining land.
79332,79333,Richard II,42.0,2.1.243,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The king is not himself, but basely led"
79333,79334,Richard II,42.0,2.1.244,NORTHUMBERLAND,"By flatterers, and what they will inform,"
79334,79335,Richard II,42.0,2.1.245,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,"
79335,79336,Richard II,42.0,2.1.246,NORTHUMBERLAND,That will the king severely prosecute
79336,79337,Richard II,42.0,2.1.247,NORTHUMBERLAND,"'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs."
79337,79338,Richard II,43.0,2.1.248,LORD ROSS,"The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,"
79338,79339,Richard II,43.0,2.1.249,LORD ROSS,And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
79339,79340,Richard II,43.0,2.1.250,LORD ROSS,"For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts."
79340,79341,Richard II,44.0,2.1.251,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And daily new exactions are devised,"
79341,79342,Richard II,44.0,2.1.252,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:"
79342,79343,Richard II,44.0,2.1.253,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?"
79343,79344,Richard II,45.0,2.1.254,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,"
79344,79345,Richard II,45.0,2.1.255,NORTHUMBERLAND,But basely yielded upon compromise
79345,79346,Richard II,45.0,2.1.256,NORTHUMBERLAND,That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
79346,79347,Richard II,45.0,2.1.257,NORTHUMBERLAND,More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
79347,79348,Richard II,46.0,2.1.258,LORD ROSS,The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
79348,79349,Richard II,47.0,2.1.259,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man."
79349,79350,Richard II,48.0,2.1.260,NORTHUMBERLAND,Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
79350,79351,Richard II,49.0,2.1.261,LORD ROSS,"He hath not money for these Irish wars,"
79351,79352,Richard II,49.0,2.1.262,LORD ROSS,"His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,"
79352,79353,Richard II,49.0,2.1.263,LORD ROSS,But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.
79353,79354,Richard II,50.0,2.1.264,NORTHUMBERLAND,His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
79354,79355,Richard II,50.0,2.1.265,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,"
79355,79356,Richard II,50.0,2.1.266,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm,"
79356,79357,Richard II,50.0,2.1.267,NORTHUMBERLAND,"We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,"
79357,79358,Richard II,50.0,2.1.268,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And yet we strike not, but securely perish."
79358,79359,Richard II,51.0,2.1.269,LORD ROSS,"We see the very wreck that we must suffer,"
79359,79360,Richard II,51.0,2.1.270,LORD ROSS,"And unavoided is the danger now,"
79360,79361,Richard II,51.0,2.1.271,LORD ROSS,For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
79361,79362,Richard II,52.0,2.1.272,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Not so, even through the hollow eyes of death"
79362,79363,Richard II,52.0,2.1.273,NORTHUMBERLAND,"I spy life peering, but I dare not say"
79363,79364,Richard II,52.0,2.1.274,NORTHUMBERLAND,How near the tidings of our comfort is.
79364,79365,Richard II,53.0,2.1.275,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours."
79365,79366,Richard II,54.0,2.1.276,LORD ROSS,"Be confident to speak, Northumberland:"
79366,79367,Richard II,54.0,2.1.277,LORD ROSS,"We three are but thyself, and, speaking so,"
79367,79368,Richard II,54.0,2.1.278,LORD ROSS,"Thy words are but as thoughts, therefore, be bold."
79368,79369,Richard II,55.0,2.1.279,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay"
79369,79370,Richard II,55.0,2.1.280,NORTHUMBERLAND,"In Brittany, received intelligence"
79370,79371,Richard II,55.0,2.1.281,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,"
79371,79372,Richard II,55.0,2.1.282,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,"
79372,79373,Richard II,55.0,2.1.283,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,"
79373,79374,Richard II,55.0,2.1.284,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,"
79374,79375,Richard II,55.0,2.1.285,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,"
79375,79376,Richard II,55.0,2.1.286,NORTHUMBERLAND,All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
79376,79377,Richard II,55.0,2.1.287,NORTHUMBERLAND,"With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,"
79377,79378,Richard II,55.0,2.1.288,NORTHUMBERLAND,Are making hither with all due expedience
79378,79379,Richard II,55.0,2.1.289,NORTHUMBERLAND,And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
79379,79380,Richard II,55.0,2.1.290,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay"
79380,79381,Richard II,55.0,2.1.291,NORTHUMBERLAND,The first departing of the king for Ireland.
79381,79382,Richard II,55.0,2.1.292,NORTHUMBERLAND,"If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,"
79382,79383,Richard II,55.0,2.1.293,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,"
79383,79384,Richard II,55.0,2.1.294,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,"
79384,79385,Richard II,55.0,2.1.295,NORTHUMBERLAND,Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
79385,79386,Richard II,55.0,2.1.296,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And make high majesty look like itself,"
79386,79387,Richard II,55.0,2.1.297,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh,"
79387,79388,Richard II,55.0,2.1.298,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But if you faint, as fearing to do so,"
79388,79389,Richard II,55.0,2.1.299,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Stay and be secret, and myself will go."
79389,79390,Richard II,56.0,2.1.300,LORD ROSS,"To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear."
79390,79391,Richard II,57.0,2.1.301,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Hold out my horse, and I will first be there."
79391,79392,Richard II,57.0,,LORD WILLOUGHBY,Exeunt
79392,79393,Richard II,57.0,,LORD WILLOUGHBY,SCENE II. The palace.
79393,79394,Richard II,57.0,,LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT"
79394,79395,Richard II,1.0,2.2.1,BUSHY,"Madam, your majesty is too much sad:"
79395,79396,Richard II,1.0,2.2.2,BUSHY,"You promised, when you parted with the king,"
79396,79397,Richard II,1.0,2.2.3,BUSHY,To lay aside life-harming heaviness
79397,79398,Richard II,1.0,2.2.4,BUSHY,And entertain a cheerful disposition.
79398,79399,Richard II,2.0,2.2.5,QUEEN,"To please the king I did, to please myself"
79399,79400,Richard II,2.0,2.2.6,QUEEN,"I cannot do it, yet I know no cause"
79400,79401,Richard II,2.0,2.2.7,QUEEN,"Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,"
79401,79402,Richard II,2.0,2.2.8,QUEEN,Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
79402,79403,Richard II,2.0,2.2.9,QUEEN,"As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,"
79403,79404,Richard II,2.0,2.2.10,QUEEN,"Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,"
79404,79405,Richard II,2.0,2.2.11,QUEEN,"Is coming towards me, and my inward soul"
79405,79406,Richard II,2.0,2.2.12,QUEEN,"With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,"
79406,79407,Richard II,2.0,2.2.13,QUEEN,More than with parting from my lord the king.
79407,79408,Richard II,3.0,2.2.14,BUSHY,"Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,"
79408,79409,Richard II,3.0,2.2.15,BUSHY,"Which shows like grief itself, but is not so,"
79409,79410,Richard II,3.0,2.2.16,BUSHY,"For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,"
79410,79411,Richard II,3.0,2.2.17,BUSHY,"Divides one thing entire to many objects,"
79411,79412,Richard II,3.0,2.2.18,BUSHY,"Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon"
79412,79413,Richard II,3.0,2.2.19,BUSHY,"Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry"
79413,79414,Richard II,3.0,2.2.20,BUSHY,"Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,"
79414,79415,Richard II,3.0,2.2.21,BUSHY,"Looking awry upon your lord's departure,"
79415,79416,Richard II,3.0,2.2.22,BUSHY,"Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail,"
79416,79417,Richard II,3.0,2.2.23,BUSHY,"Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows"
79417,79418,Richard II,3.0,2.2.24,BUSHY,"Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,"
79418,79419,Richard II,3.0,2.2.25,BUSHY,"More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen,"
79419,79420,Richard II,3.0,2.2.26,BUSHY,"Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,"
79420,79421,Richard II,3.0,2.2.27,BUSHY,Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
79421,79422,Richard II,4.0,2.2.28,QUEEN,"It may be so, but yet my inward soul"
79422,79423,Richard II,4.0,2.2.29,QUEEN,"Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,"
79423,79424,Richard II,4.0,2.2.30,QUEEN,"I cannot but be sad, so heavy sad"
79424,79425,Richard II,4.0,2.2.31,QUEEN,"As, though on thinking on no thought I think,"
79425,79426,Richard II,4.0,2.2.32,QUEEN,Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
79426,79427,Richard II,5.0,2.2.33,BUSHY,"'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady."
79427,79428,Richard II,6.0,2.2.34,QUEEN,'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
79428,79429,Richard II,6.0,2.2.35,QUEEN,"From some forefather grief, mine is not so,"
79429,79430,Richard II,6.0,2.2.36,QUEEN,"For nothing had begot my something grief,"
79430,79431,Richard II,6.0,2.2.37,QUEEN,Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
79431,79432,Richard II,6.0,2.2.38,QUEEN,"'Tis in reversion that I do possess,"
79432,79433,Richard II,6.0,2.2.39,QUEEN,"But what it is, that is not yet known, what"
79433,79434,Richard II,6.0,2.2.40,QUEEN,"I cannot name, 'tis nameless woe, I wot."
79434,79435,Richard II,6.0,,QUEEN,Enter GREEN
79435,79436,Richard II,7.0,2.2.41,GREEN,"God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:"
79436,79437,Richard II,7.0,2.2.42,GREEN,I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
79437,79438,Richard II,8.0,2.2.43,QUEEN,"Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is,"
79438,79439,Richard II,8.0,2.2.44,QUEEN,"For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:"
79439,79440,Richard II,8.0,2.2.45,QUEEN,Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
79440,79441,Richard II,9.0,2.2.46,GREEN,"That he, our hope, might have retired his power,"
79441,79442,Richard II,9.0,2.2.47,GREEN,"And driven into despair an enemy's hope,"
79442,79443,Richard II,9.0,2.2.48,GREEN,Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
79443,79444,Richard II,9.0,2.2.49,GREEN,"The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,"
79444,79445,Richard II,9.0,2.2.50,GREEN,And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
79445,79446,Richard II,9.0,2.2.51,GREEN,At Ravenspurgh.
79446,79447,Richard II,10.0,2.2.52,QUEEN,Now God in heaven forbid!
79447,79448,Richard II,11.0,2.2.53,GREEN,"Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,"
79448,79449,Richard II,11.0,2.2.54,GREEN,"The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,"
79449,79450,Richard II,11.0,2.2.55,GREEN,"The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,"
79450,79451,Richard II,11.0,2.2.56,GREEN,"With all their powerful friends, are fled to him."
79451,79452,Richard II,12.0,2.2.57,BUSHY,Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
79452,79453,Richard II,12.0,2.2.58,BUSHY,And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
79453,79454,Richard II,13.0,2.2.59,GREEN,We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
79454,79455,Richard II,13.0,2.2.60,GREEN,"Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,"
79455,79456,Richard II,13.0,2.2.61,GREEN,And all the household servants fled with him
79456,79457,Richard II,13.0,2.2.62,GREEN,To Bolingbroke.
79457,79458,Richard II,14.0,2.2.63,QUEEN,"So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,"
79458,79459,Richard II,14.0,2.2.64,QUEEN,And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
79459,79460,Richard II,14.0,2.2.65,QUEEN,"Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,"
79460,79461,Richard II,14.0,2.2.66,QUEEN,"And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,"
79461,79462,Richard II,14.0,2.2.67,QUEEN,"Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd."
79462,79463,Richard II,15.0,2.2.68,BUSHY,"Despair not, madam."
79463,79464,Richard II,16.0,2.2.69,QUEEN,Who shall hinder me?
79464,79465,Richard II,16.0,2.2.70,QUEEN,"I will despair, and be at enmity"
79465,79466,Richard II,16.0,2.2.71,QUEEN,"With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,"
79466,79467,Richard II,16.0,2.2.72,QUEEN,"A parasite, a keeper back of death,"
79467,79468,Richard II,16.0,2.2.73,QUEEN,"Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,"
79468,79469,Richard II,16.0,2.2.74,QUEEN,Which false hope lingers in extremity.
79469,79470,Richard II,16.0,,QUEEN,Enter DUKE OF YORK
79470,79471,Richard II,17.0,2.2.75,GREEN,Here comes the Duke of York.
79471,79472,Richard II,18.0,2.2.76,QUEEN,With signs of war about his aged neck:
79472,79473,Richard II,18.0,2.2.77,QUEEN,"O, full of careful business are his looks!"
79473,79474,Richard II,18.0,2.2.78,QUEEN,"Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words."
79474,79475,Richard II,19.0,2.2.79,DUKE OF YORK,"Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:"
79475,79476,Richard II,19.0,2.2.80,DUKE OF YORK,"Comfort's in heaven, and we are on the earth,"
79476,79477,Richard II,19.0,2.2.81,DUKE OF YORK,"Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief."
79477,79478,Richard II,19.0,2.2.82,DUKE OF YORK,"Your husband, he is gone to save far off,"
79478,79479,Richard II,19.0,2.2.83,DUKE OF YORK,Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
79479,79480,Richard II,19.0,2.2.84,DUKE OF YORK,"Here am I left to underprop his land,"
79480,79481,Richard II,19.0,2.2.85,DUKE OF YORK,"Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:"
79481,79482,Richard II,19.0,2.2.86,DUKE OF YORK,"Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made,"
79482,79483,Richard II,19.0,2.2.87,DUKE OF YORK,Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.
79483,79484,Richard II,19.0,,DUKE OF YORK,Enter a Servant
79484,79485,Richard II,20.0,2.2.88,Servant,"My lord, your son was gone before I came."
79485,79486,Richard II,21.0,2.2.89,DUKE OF YORK,"He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!"
79486,79487,Richard II,21.0,2.2.90,DUKE OF YORK,"The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,"
79487,79488,Richard II,21.0,2.2.91,DUKE OF YORK,"And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side."
79488,79489,Richard II,21.0,2.2.92,DUKE OF YORK,"Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester,"
79489,79490,Richard II,21.0,2.2.93,DUKE OF YORK,Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
79490,79491,Richard II,21.0,2.2.94,DUKE OF YORK,"Hold, take my ring."
79491,79492,Richard II,22.0,2.2.95,Servant,"My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,"
79492,79493,Richard II,22.0,2.2.96,Servant,"To-day, as I came by, I called there,"
79493,79494,Richard II,22.0,2.2.97,Servant,But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
79494,79495,Richard II,23.0,2.2.98,DUKE OF YORK,"What is't, knave?"
79495,79496,Richard II,24.0,2.2.99,Servant,"An hour before I came, the duchess died."
79496,79497,Richard II,25.0,2.2.100,DUKE OF YORK,God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
79497,79498,Richard II,25.0,2.2.101,DUKE OF YORK,Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
79498,79499,Richard II,25.0,2.2.102,DUKE OF YORK,"I know not what to do: I would to God,"
79499,79500,Richard II,25.0,2.2.103,DUKE OF YORK,"So my untruth had not provoked him to it,"
79500,79501,Richard II,25.0,2.2.104,DUKE OF YORK,The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
79501,79502,Richard II,25.0,2.2.105,DUKE OF YORK,"What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?"
79502,79503,Richard II,25.0,2.2.106,DUKE OF YORK,How shall we do for money for these wars?
79503,79504,Richard II,25.0,2.2.107,DUKE OF YORK,"Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me."
79504,79505,Richard II,25.0,2.2.108,DUKE OF YORK,"Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts"
79505,79506,Richard II,25.0,2.2.109,DUKE OF YORK,And bring away the armour that is there.
79506,79507,Richard II,25.0,,DUKE OF YORK,Exit Servant
79507,79508,Richard II,25.0,2.2.110,DUKE OF YORK,"Gentlemen, will you go muster men?"
79508,79509,Richard II,25.0,2.2.111,DUKE OF YORK,If I know how or which way to order these affairs
79509,79510,Richard II,25.0,2.2.112,DUKE OF YORK,"Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,"
79510,79511,Richard II,25.0,2.2.113,DUKE OF YORK,Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
79511,79512,Richard II,25.0,2.2.114,DUKE OF YORK,"The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath"
79512,79513,Richard II,25.0,2.2.115,DUKE OF YORK,"And duty bids defend, the other again"
79513,79514,Richard II,25.0,2.2.116,DUKE OF YORK,"Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,"
79514,79515,Richard II,25.0,2.2.117,DUKE OF YORK,Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
79515,79516,Richard II,25.0,2.2.118,DUKE OF YORK,"Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll"
79516,79517,Richard II,25.0,2.2.119,DUKE OF YORK,Dispose of you.
79517,79518,Richard II,25.0,2.2.120,DUKE OF YORK,"Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,"
79518,79519,Richard II,25.0,2.2.121,DUKE OF YORK,And meet me presently at Berkeley.
79519,79520,Richard II,25.0,2.2.122,DUKE OF YORK,"I should to Plashy too,"
79520,79521,Richard II,25.0,2.2.123,DUKE OF YORK,"But time will not permit: all is uneven,"
79521,79522,Richard II,25.0,2.2.124,DUKE OF YORK,And every thing is left at six and seven.
79522,79523,Richard II,25.0,,DUKE OF YORK,Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN
79523,79524,Richard II,26.0,2.2.125,BUSHY,"The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,"
79524,79525,Richard II,26.0,2.2.126,BUSHY,But none returns. For us to levy power
79525,79526,Richard II,26.0,2.2.127,BUSHY,Proportionable to the enemy
79526,79527,Richard II,26.0,2.2.128,BUSHY,Is all unpossible.
79527,79528,Richard II,27.0,2.2.129,GREEN,"Besides, our nearness to the king in love"
79528,79529,Richard II,27.0,2.2.130,GREEN,Is near the hate of those love not the king.
79529,79530,Richard II,28.0,2.2.131,BAGOT,And that's the wavering commons: for their love
79530,79531,Richard II,28.0,2.2.132,BAGOT,"Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them"
79531,79532,Richard II,28.0,2.2.133,BAGOT,By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
79532,79533,Richard II,29.0,2.2.134,BUSHY,Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
79533,79534,Richard II,30.0,2.2.135,BAGOT,"If judgement lie in them, then so do we,"
79534,79535,Richard II,30.0,2.2.136,BAGOT,Because we ever have been near the king.
79535,79536,Richard II,31.0,2.2.137,GREEN,"Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:"
79536,79537,Richard II,31.0,2.2.138,GREEN,The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
79537,79538,Richard II,32.0,2.2.139,BUSHY,"Thither will I with you, for little office"
79538,79539,Richard II,32.0,2.2.140,BUSHY,"The hateful commons will perform for us,"
79539,79540,Richard II,32.0,2.2.141,BUSHY,Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
79540,79541,Richard II,32.0,2.2.142,BUSHY,Will you go along with us?
79541,79542,Richard II,33.0,2.2.143,BAGOT,"No, I will to Ireland to his majesty."
79542,79543,Richard II,33.0,2.2.144,BAGOT,"Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,"
79543,79544,Richard II,33.0,2.2.145,BAGOT,We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.
79544,79545,Richard II,34.0,2.2.146,BUSHY,That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
79545,79546,Richard II,35.0,2.2.147,GREEN,"Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes"
79546,79547,Richard II,35.0,2.2.148,GREEN,Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
79547,79548,Richard II,35.0,2.2.149,GREEN,"Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly."
79548,79549,Richard II,35.0,2.2.150,GREEN,"Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever."
79549,79550,Richard II,36.0,2.2.151,BUSHY,"Well, we may meet again."
79550,79551,Richard II,37.0,2.2.152,BAGOT,"I fear me, never."
79551,79552,Richard II,37.0,,BAGOT,Exeunt
79552,79553,Richard II,37.0,,BAGOT,SCENE III. Wilds in Gloucestershire.
79553,79554,Richard II,37.0,,BAGOT,"Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces"
79554,79555,Richard II,1.0,2.3.1,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?"
79555,79556,Richard II,2.0,2.3.2,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Believe me, noble lord,"
79556,79557,Richard II,2.0,2.3.3,NORTHUMBERLAND,I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
79557,79558,Richard II,2.0,2.3.4,NORTHUMBERLAND,These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
79558,79559,Richard II,2.0,2.3.5,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,"
79559,79560,Richard II,2.0,2.3.6,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,"
79560,79561,Richard II,2.0,2.3.7,NORTHUMBERLAND,Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
79561,79562,Richard II,2.0,2.3.8,NORTHUMBERLAND,But I bethink me what a weary way
79562,79563,Richard II,2.0,2.3.9,NORTHUMBERLAND,From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
79563,79564,Richard II,2.0,2.3.10,NORTHUMBERLAND,"In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,"
79564,79565,Richard II,2.0,2.3.11,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled"
79565,79566,Richard II,2.0,2.3.12,NORTHUMBERLAND,The tediousness and process of my travel:
79566,79567,Richard II,2.0,2.3.13,NORTHUMBERLAND,But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
79567,79568,Richard II,2.0,2.3.14,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The present benefit which I possess,"
79568,79569,Richard II,2.0,2.3.15,NORTHUMBERLAND,And hope to joy is little less in joy
79569,79570,Richard II,2.0,2.3.16,NORTHUMBERLAND,Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
79570,79571,Richard II,2.0,2.3.17,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done"
79571,79572,Richard II,2.0,2.3.18,NORTHUMBERLAND,"By sight of what I have, your noble company."
79572,79573,Richard II,3.0,2.3.19,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Of much less value is my company
79573,79574,Richard II,3.0,2.3.20,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Than your good words. But who comes here?
79574,79575,Richard II,3.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Enter HENRY PERCY
79575,79576,Richard II,4.0,2.3.21,NORTHUMBERLAND,"It is my son, young Harry Percy,"
79576,79577,Richard II,4.0,2.3.22,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever."
79577,79578,Richard II,4.0,2.3.23,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Harry, how fares your uncle?"
79578,79579,Richard II,5.0,2.3.24,HENRY PERCY,"I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you."
79579,79580,Richard II,6.0,2.3.25,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Why, is he not with the queen?"
79580,79581,Richard II,7.0,2.3.26,HENRY PERCY,"No, my good Lord, he hath forsook the court,"
79581,79582,Richard II,7.0,2.3.27,HENRY PERCY,Broken his staff of office and dispersed
79582,79583,Richard II,7.0,2.3.28,HENRY PERCY,The household of the king.
79583,79584,Richard II,8.0,2.3.29,NORTHUMBERLAND,What was his reason?
79584,79585,Richard II,8.0,2.3.30,NORTHUMBERLAND,He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
79585,79586,Richard II,9.0,2.3.31,HENRY PERCY,Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
79586,79587,Richard II,9.0,2.3.32,HENRY PERCY,"But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,"
79587,79588,Richard II,9.0,2.3.33,HENRY PERCY,"To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,"
79588,79589,Richard II,9.0,2.3.34,HENRY PERCY,"And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover"
79589,79590,Richard II,9.0,2.3.35,HENRY PERCY,"What power the Duke of York had levied there,"
79590,79591,Richard II,9.0,2.3.36,HENRY PERCY,Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
79591,79592,Richard II,10.0,2.3.37,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?"
79592,79593,Richard II,11.0,2.3.38,HENRY PERCY,"No, my good lord, for that is not forgot"
79593,79594,Richard II,11.0,2.3.39,HENRY PERCY,"Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,"
79594,79595,Richard II,11.0,2.3.40,HENRY PERCY,I never in my life did look on him.
79595,79596,Richard II,12.0,2.3.41,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Then learn to know him now, this is the duke."
79596,79597,Richard II,13.0,2.3.42,HENRY PERCY,"My gracious lord, I tender you my service,"
79597,79598,Richard II,13.0,2.3.43,HENRY PERCY,"Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:"
79598,79599,Richard II,13.0,2.3.44,HENRY PERCY,Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
79599,79600,Richard II,13.0,2.3.45,HENRY PERCY,To more approved service and desert.
79600,79601,Richard II,14.0,2.3.46,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I thank thee, gentle Percy, and be sure"
79601,79602,Richard II,14.0,2.3.47,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,I count myself in nothing else so happy
79602,79603,Richard II,14.0,2.3.48,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As in a soul remembering my good friends,"
79603,79604,Richard II,14.0,2.3.49,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,"
79604,79605,Richard II,14.0,2.3.50,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
79605,79606,Richard II,14.0,2.3.51,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it."
79606,79607,Richard II,15.0,2.3.52,NORTHUMBERLAND,How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
79607,79608,Richard II,15.0,2.3.53,NORTHUMBERLAND,Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
79608,79609,Richard II,16.0,2.3.54,HENRY PERCY,"There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,"
79609,79610,Richard II,16.0,2.3.55,HENRY PERCY,"Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard,"
79610,79611,Richard II,16.0,2.3.56,HENRY PERCY,"And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour,"
79611,79612,Richard II,16.0,2.3.57,HENRY PERCY,None else of name and noble estimate.
79612,79613,Richard II,16.0,,HENRY PERCY,Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY
79613,79614,Richard II,17.0,2.3.58,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,"
79614,79615,Richard II,17.0,2.3.59,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste."
79615,79616,Richard II,18.0,2.3.60,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues"
79616,79617,Richard II,18.0,2.3.61,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
79617,79618,Richard II,18.0,2.3.62,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd"
79618,79619,Richard II,18.0,2.3.63,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
79619,79620,Richard II,19.0,2.3.64,LORD ROSS,"Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord."
79620,79621,Richard II,20.0,2.3.65,LORD WILLOUGHBY,And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
79621,79622,Richard II,21.0,2.3.66,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor,"
79622,79623,Richard II,21.0,2.3.67,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,"
79623,79624,Richard II,21.0,2.3.68,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?
79624,79625,Richard II,21.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Enter LORD BERKELEY
79625,79626,Richard II,22.0,2.3.69,NORTHUMBERLAND,"It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess."
79626,79627,Richard II,23.0,2.3.70,LORD BERKELEY,"My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you."
79627,79628,Richard II,24.0,2.3.71,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster,"
79628,79629,Richard II,24.0,2.3.72,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And I am come to seek that name in England,"
79629,79630,Richard II,24.0,2.3.73,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And I must find that title in your tongue,"
79630,79631,Richard II,24.0,2.3.74,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Before I make reply to aught you say.
79631,79632,Richard II,25.0,2.3.75,LORD BERKELEY,"Mistake me not, my lord, 'tis not my meaning"
79632,79633,Richard II,25.0,2.3.76,LORD BERKELEY,To raze one title of your honour out:
79633,79634,Richard II,25.0,2.3.77,LORD BERKELEY,"To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,"
79634,79635,Richard II,25.0,2.3.78,LORD BERKELEY,"From the most gracious regent of this land,"
79635,79636,Richard II,25.0,2.3.79,LORD BERKELEY,"The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on"
79636,79637,Richard II,25.0,2.3.80,LORD BERKELEY,To take advantage of the absent time
79637,79638,Richard II,25.0,2.3.81,LORD BERKELEY,And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
79638,79639,Richard II,25.0,,LORD BERKELEY,Enter DUKE OF YORK attended
79639,79640,Richard II,26.0,2.3.82,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I shall not need transport my words by you,"
79640,79641,Richard II,26.0,2.3.83,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
79641,79642,Richard II,26.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Kneels
79642,79643,Richard II,27.0,2.3.84,DUKE OF YORK,"Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,"
79643,79644,Richard II,27.0,2.3.85,DUKE OF YORK,Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
79644,79645,Richard II,28.0,2.3.86,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,My gracious uncle--
79645,79646,Richard II,29.0,2.3.87,DUKE OF YORK,"Tut, tut!"
79646,79647,Richard II,29.0,2.3.88,DUKE OF YORK,"Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:"
79647,79648,Richard II,29.0,2.3.89,DUKE OF YORK,"I am no traitor's uncle, and that word 'grace.'"
79648,79649,Richard II,29.0,2.3.90,DUKE OF YORK,In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
79649,79650,Richard II,29.0,2.3.91,DUKE OF YORK,Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
79650,79651,Richard II,29.0,2.3.92,DUKE OF YORK,Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
79651,79652,Richard II,29.0,2.3.93,DUKE OF YORK,But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
79652,79653,Richard II,29.0,2.3.94,DUKE OF YORK,"So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,"
79653,79654,Richard II,29.0,2.3.95,DUKE OF YORK,Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
79654,79655,Richard II,29.0,2.3.96,DUKE OF YORK,And ostentation of despised arms?
79655,79656,Richard II,29.0,2.3.97,DUKE OF YORK,Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
79656,79657,Richard II,29.0,2.3.98,DUKE OF YORK,"Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,"
79657,79658,Richard II,29.0,2.3.99,DUKE OF YORK,And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
79658,79659,Richard II,29.0,2.3.100,DUKE OF YORK,Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
79659,79660,Richard II,29.0,2.3.101,DUKE OF YORK,"As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself"
79660,79661,Richard II,29.0,2.3.102,DUKE OF YORK,"Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,"
79661,79662,Richard II,29.0,2.3.103,DUKE OF YORK,"From forth the ranks of many thousand French,"
79662,79663,Richard II,29.0,2.3.104,DUKE OF YORK,"O, then how quickly should this arm of mine."
79663,79664,Richard II,29.0,2.3.105,DUKE OF YORK,"Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee"
79664,79665,Richard II,29.0,2.3.106,DUKE OF YORK,And minister correction to thy fault!
79665,79666,Richard II,30.0,2.3.107,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:"
79666,79667,Richard II,30.0,2.3.108,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,On what condition stands it and wherein?
79667,79668,Richard II,31.0,2.3.109,DUKE OF YORK,"Even in condition of the worst degree,"
79668,79669,Richard II,31.0,2.3.110,DUKE OF YORK,In gross rebellion and detested treason:
79669,79670,Richard II,31.0,2.3.111,DUKE OF YORK,"Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come"
79670,79671,Richard II,31.0,2.3.112,DUKE OF YORK,"Before the expiration of thy time,"
79671,79672,Richard II,31.0,2.3.113,DUKE OF YORK,In braving arms against thy sovereign.
79672,79673,Richard II,32.0,2.3.114,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford,"
79673,79674,Richard II,32.0,2.3.115,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But as I come, I come for Lancaster."
79674,79675,Richard II,32.0,2.3.116,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace"
79675,79676,Richard II,32.0,2.3.117,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
79676,79677,Richard II,32.0,2.3.118,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"You are my father, for methinks in you"
79677,79678,Richard II,32.0,2.3.119,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I see old Gaunt alive, O, then, my father,"
79678,79679,Richard II,32.0,2.3.120,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
79679,79680,Richard II,32.0,2.3.121,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties"
79680,79681,Richard II,32.0,2.3.122,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
79681,79682,Richard II,32.0,2.3.123,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
79682,79683,Richard II,32.0,2.3.124,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"If that my cousin king be King of England,"
79683,79684,Richard II,32.0,2.3.125,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
79684,79685,Richard II,32.0,2.3.126,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin,"
79685,79686,Richard II,32.0,2.3.127,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,"
79686,79687,Richard II,32.0,2.3.128,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,"
79687,79688,Richard II,32.0,2.3.129,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
79688,79689,Richard II,32.0,2.3.130,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I am denied to sue my livery here,"
79689,79690,Richard II,32.0,2.3.131,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
79690,79691,Richard II,32.0,2.3.132,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,"
79691,79692,Richard II,32.0,2.3.133,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
79692,79693,Richard II,32.0,2.3.134,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"What would you have me do? I am a subject,"
79693,79694,Richard II,32.0,2.3.135,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me,"
79694,79695,Richard II,32.0,2.3.136,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And therefore, personally I lay my claim"
79695,79696,Richard II,32.0,2.3.137,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,To my inheritance of free descent.
79696,79697,Richard II,33.0,2.3.138,NORTHUMBERLAND,The noble duke hath been too much abused.
79697,79698,Richard II,34.0,2.3.139,LORD ROSS,It stands your grace upon to do him right.
79698,79699,Richard II,35.0,2.3.140,LORD WILLOUGHBY,Base men by his endowments are made great.
79699,79700,Richard II,36.0,2.3.141,DUKE OF YORK,"My lords of England, let me tell you this:"
79700,79701,Richard II,36.0,2.3.142,DUKE OF YORK,I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
79701,79702,Richard II,36.0,2.3.143,DUKE OF YORK,"And laboured all I could to do him right,"
79702,79703,Richard II,36.0,2.3.144,DUKE OF YORK,"But in this kind to come, in braving arms,"
79703,79704,Richard II,36.0,2.3.145,DUKE OF YORK,"Be his own carver and cut out his way,"
79704,79705,Richard II,36.0,2.3.146,DUKE OF YORK,"To find out right with wrong, it may not be,"
79705,79706,Richard II,36.0,2.3.147,DUKE OF YORK,And you that do abet him in this kind
79706,79707,Richard II,36.0,2.3.148,DUKE OF YORK,Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
79707,79708,Richard II,37.0,2.3.149,NORTHUMBERLAND,The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
79708,79709,Richard II,37.0,2.3.150,NORTHUMBERLAND,"But for his own, and for the right of that"
79709,79710,Richard II,37.0,2.3.151,NORTHUMBERLAND,"We all have strongly sworn to give him aid,"
79710,79711,Richard II,37.0,2.3.152,NORTHUMBERLAND,And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
79711,79712,Richard II,38.0,2.3.153,DUKE OF YORK,"Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:"
79712,79713,Richard II,38.0,2.3.154,DUKE OF YORK,"I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,"
79713,79714,Richard II,38.0,2.3.155,DUKE OF YORK,Because my power is weak and all ill left:
79714,79715,Richard II,38.0,2.3.156,DUKE OF YORK,"But if I could, by Him that gave me life,"
79715,79716,Richard II,38.0,2.3.157,DUKE OF YORK,I would attach you all and make you stoop
79716,79717,Richard II,38.0,2.3.158,DUKE OF YORK,"Unto the sovereign mercy of the king,"
79717,79718,Richard II,38.0,2.3.159,DUKE OF YORK,"But since I cannot, be it known to you"
79718,79719,Richard II,38.0,2.3.160,DUKE OF YORK,"I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well,"
79719,79720,Richard II,38.0,2.3.161,DUKE OF YORK,Unless you please to enter in the castle
79720,79721,Richard II,38.0,2.3.162,DUKE OF YORK,And there repose you for this night.
79721,79722,Richard II,39.0,2.3.163,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"An offer, uncle, that we will accept:"
79722,79723,Richard II,39.0,2.3.164,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,But we must win your grace to go with us
79723,79724,Richard II,39.0,2.3.165,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To Bristol castle, which they say is held"
79724,79725,Richard II,39.0,2.3.166,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,"
79725,79726,Richard II,39.0,2.3.167,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The caterpillars of the commonwealth,"
79726,79727,Richard II,39.0,2.3.168,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
79727,79728,Richard II,40.0,2.3.169,DUKE OF YORK,"It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause,"
79728,79729,Richard II,40.0,2.3.170,DUKE OF YORK,For I am loath to break our country's laws.
79729,79730,Richard II,40.0,2.3.171,DUKE OF YORK,"Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:"
79730,79731,Richard II,40.0,2.3.172,DUKE OF YORK,Things past redress are now with me past care.

79735,79736,Richard II,1.0,2.4.2,Captain,"And hardly kept our countrymen together,"
79736,79737,Richard II,1.0,2.4.3,Captain,"And yet we hear no tidings from the king,"
79737,79738,Richard II,1.0,2.4.4,Captain,Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.
79738,79739,Richard II,2.0,2.4.5,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:"
79739,79740,Richard II,2.0,2.4.6,EARL OF SALISBURY,The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.
79740,79741,Richard II,3.0,2.4.7,Captain,"'Tis thought the king is dead, we will not stay."
79741,79742,Richard II,3.0,2.4.8,Captain,The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
79742,79743,Richard II,3.0,2.4.9,Captain,"And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven,"
79743,79744,Richard II,3.0,2.4.10,Captain,The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
79744,79745,Richard II,3.0,2.4.11,Captain,"And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change,"

79746,79747,Richard II,3.0,2.4.13,Captain,"The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,"
79747,79748,Richard II,3.0,2.4.14,Captain,The other to enjoy by rage and war:
79748,79749,Richard II,3.0,2.4.15,Captain,These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
79749,79750,Richard II,3.0,2.4.16,Captain,"Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,"
79750,79751,Richard II,3.0,2.4.17,Captain,As well assured Richard their king is dead.
79751,79752,Richard II,3.0,,Captain,Exit

79772,79773,Richard II,1.0,3.1.10,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,By you unhappied and disfigured clean:

79776,79777,Richard II,1.0,3.1.14,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks

79778,79779,Richard II,1.0,3.1.16,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,"

79834,79835,Richard II,3.0,3.2.24,KING RICHARD II,This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
79835,79836,Richard II,3.0,3.2.25,KING RICHARD II,"Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king"
79836,79837,Richard II,3.0,3.2.26,KING RICHARD II,Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
79837,79838,Richard II,4.0,3.2.27,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king"
79838,79839,Richard II,4.0,3.2.28,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
79839,79840,Richard II,4.0,3.2.29,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The means that heaven yields must be embraced,"
79840,79841,Richard II,4.0,3.2.30,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And not neglected, else, if heaven would,"
79841,79842,Richard II,4.0,3.2.31,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,"
79842,79843,Richard II,4.0,3.2.32,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
79843,79844,Richard II,5.0,3.2.33,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,"
79844,79845,Richard II,5.0,3.2.34,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,"
79845,79846,Richard II,5.0,3.2.35,DUKE OF AUMERLE,Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
79846,79847,Richard II,6.0,3.2.36,KING RICHARD II,Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
79847,79848,Richard II,6.0,3.2.37,KING RICHARD II,"That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,"
79848,79849,Richard II,6.0,3.2.38,KING RICHARD II,"Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,"
79849,79850,Richard II,6.0,3.2.39,KING RICHARD II,Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
79850,79851,Richard II,6.0,3.2.40,KING RICHARD II,"In murders and in outrage, boldly here,"
79851,79852,Richard II,6.0,3.2.41,KING RICHARD II,But when from under this terrestrial ball
79852,79853,Richard II,6.0,3.2.42,KING RICHARD II,He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
79853,79854,Richard II,6.0,3.2.43,KING RICHARD II,"And darts his light through every guilty hole,"
79854,79855,Richard II,6.0,3.2.44,KING RICHARD II,"Then murders, treasons and detested sins,"
79855,79856,Richard II,6.0,3.2.45,KING RICHARD II,"The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,"
79856,79857,Richard II,6.0,3.2.46,KING RICHARD II,"Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?"
79857,79858,Richard II,6.0,3.2.47,KING RICHARD II,"So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,"
79858,79859,Richard II,6.0,3.2.48,KING RICHARD II,Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
79859,79860,Richard II,6.0,3.2.49,KING RICHARD II,"Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,"
79860,79861,Richard II,6.0,3.2.50,KING RICHARD II,"Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,"
79861,79862,Richard II,6.0,3.2.51,KING RICHARD II,"His treasons will sit blushing in his face,"
79862,79863,Richard II,6.0,3.2.52,KING RICHARD II,"Not able to endure the sight of day,"
79863,79864,Richard II,6.0,3.2.53,KING RICHARD II,But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
79864,79865,Richard II,6.0,3.2.54,KING RICHARD II,Not all the water in the rough rude sea
79865,79866,Richard II,6.0,3.2.55,KING RICHARD II,"Can wash the balm off from an anointed king,"
79866,79867,Richard II,6.0,3.2.56,KING RICHARD II,The breath of worldly men cannot depose
79867,79868,Richard II,6.0,3.2.57,KING RICHARD II,The deputy elected by the Lord:
79868,79869,Richard II,6.0,3.2.58,KING RICHARD II,For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
79869,79870,Richard II,6.0,3.2.59,KING RICHARD II,"To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,"
79870,79871,Richard II,6.0,3.2.60,KING RICHARD II,God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
79871,79872,Richard II,6.0,3.2.61,KING RICHARD II,"A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,"

79873,79874,Richard II,6.0,,KING RICHARD II,Enter EARL OF SALISBURY
79874,79875,Richard II,6.0,3.2.63,KING RICHARD II,"Welcome, my lord	how far off lies your power?"
79875,79876,Richard II,7.0,3.2.64,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,"
79876,79877,Richard II,7.0,3.2.65,EARL OF SALISBURY,Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
79877,79878,Richard II,7.0,3.2.66,EARL OF SALISBURY,And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
79878,79879,Richard II,7.0,3.2.67,EARL OF SALISBURY,"One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,"
79879,79880,Richard II,7.0,3.2.68,EARL OF SALISBURY,Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
79880,79881,Richard II,7.0,3.2.69,EARL OF SALISBURY,"O, call back yesterday, bid time return,"
79881,79882,Richard II,7.0,3.2.70,EARL OF SALISBURY,And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
79882,79883,Richard II,7.0,3.2.71,EARL OF SALISBURY,"To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,"
79883,79884,Richard II,7.0,3.2.72,EARL OF SALISBURY,"O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:"
79884,79885,Richard II,7.0,3.2.73,EARL OF SALISBURY,"For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead."
79885,79886,Richard II,7.0,3.2.74,EARL OF SALISBURY,"Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled."
79886,79887,Richard II,8.0,3.2.75,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Comfort, my liege, why looks your grace so pale?"
79887,79888,Richard II,9.0,3.2.76,KING RICHARD II,But now the blood of twenty thousand men
79888,79889,Richard II,9.0,3.2.77,KING RICHARD II,"Did triumph in my face, and they are fled,"
79889,79890,Richard II,9.0,3.2.78,KING RICHARD II,"And, till so much blood thither come again,"
79890,79891,Richard II,9.0,3.2.79,KING RICHARD II,Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
79891,79892,Richard II,9.0,3.2.80,KING RICHARD II,"All souls that will be safe fly from my side,"
79892,79893,Richard II,9.0,3.2.81,KING RICHARD II,For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
79893,79894,Richard II,10.0,3.2.82,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Comfort, my liege, remember who you are."
79894,79895,Richard II,11.0,3.2.83,KING RICHARD II,"I had forgot myself, am I not king?"
79895,79896,Richard II,11.0,3.2.84,KING RICHARD II,"Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest."
79896,79897,Richard II,11.0,3.2.85,KING RICHARD II,Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
79897,79898,Richard II,11.0,3.2.86,KING RICHARD II,"Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes"
79898,79899,Richard II,11.0,3.2.87,KING RICHARD II,"At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,"
79899,79900,Richard II,11.0,3.2.88,KING RICHARD II,Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
79900,79901,Richard II,11.0,3.2.89,KING RICHARD II,High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
79901,79902,Richard II,11.0,3.2.90,KING RICHARD II,Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
79902,79903,Richard II,11.0,,KING RICHARD II,Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
79903,79904,Richard II,12.0,3.2.91,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,More health and happiness betide my liege
79904,79905,Richard II,12.0,3.2.92,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
79905,79906,Richard II,13.0,3.2.93,KING RICHARD II,"Mine ear is open and my heart prepared,"
79906,79907,Richard II,13.0,3.2.94,KING RICHARD II,The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
79907,79908,Richard II,13.0,3.2.95,KING RICHARD II,"Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care"
79908,79909,Richard II,13.0,3.2.96,KING RICHARD II,And what loss is it to be rid of care?
79909,79910,Richard II,13.0,3.2.97,KING RICHARD II,Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
79910,79911,Richard II,13.0,3.2.98,KING RICHARD II,"Greater he shall not be, if he serve God,"
79911,79912,Richard II,13.0,3.2.99,KING RICHARD II,We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
79912,79913,Richard II,13.0,3.2.100,KING RICHARD II,"Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend,"
79913,79914,Richard II,13.0,3.2.101,KING RICHARD II,They break their faith to God as well as us:
79914,79915,Richard II,13.0,3.2.102,KING RICHARD II,"Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:"
79915,79916,Richard II,13.0,3.2.103,KING RICHARD II,"The worst is death, and death will have his day."
79916,79917,Richard II,14.0,3.2.104,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
79917,79918,Richard II,14.0,3.2.105,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,To bear the tidings of calamity.
79918,79919,Richard II,14.0,3.2.106,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Like an unseasonable stormy day,"
79919,79920,Richard II,14.0,3.2.107,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,"
79920,79921,Richard II,14.0,3.2.108,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"As if the world were all dissolved to tears,"
79921,79922,Richard II,14.0,3.2.109,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,So high above his limits swells the rage
79922,79923,Richard II,14.0,3.2.110,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land"
79923,79924,Richard II,14.0,3.2.111,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
79924,79925,Richard II,14.0,3.2.112,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
79925,79926,Richard II,14.0,3.2.113,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Against thy majesty, boys, with women's voices,"
79926,79927,Richard II,14.0,3.2.114,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
79927,79928,Richard II,14.0,3.2.115,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
79928,79929,Richard II,14.0,3.2.116,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
79929,79930,Richard II,14.0,3.2.117,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Of double-fatal yew against thy state,"
79930,79931,Richard II,14.0,3.2.118,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills"
79931,79932,Richard II,14.0,3.2.119,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,"
79932,79933,Richard II,14.0,3.2.120,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
79933,79934,Richard II,15.0,3.2.121,KING RICHARD II,"Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill."
79934,79935,Richard II,15.0,3.2.122,KING RICHARD II,Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
79935,79936,Richard II,15.0,3.2.123,KING RICHARD II,What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
79936,79937,Richard II,15.0,3.2.124,KING RICHARD II,That they have let the dangerous enemy
79937,79938,Richard II,15.0,3.2.125,KING RICHARD II,Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
79938,79939,Richard II,15.0,3.2.126,KING RICHARD II,"If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:"
79939,79940,Richard II,15.0,3.2.127,KING RICHARD II,I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
79940,79941,Richard II,16.0,3.2.128,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord."
79941,79942,Richard II,17.0,3.2.129,KING RICHARD II,"O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!"
79942,79943,Richard II,17.0,3.2.130,KING RICHARD II,"Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!"
79943,79944,Richard II,17.0,3.2.131,KING RICHARD II,"Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!"
79944,79945,Richard II,17.0,3.2.132,KING RICHARD II,"Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!"
79945,79946,Richard II,17.0,3.2.133,KING RICHARD II,Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
79946,79947,Richard II,17.0,3.2.134,KING RICHARD II,Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
79947,79948,Richard II,18.0,3.2.135,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Sweet love, I see, changing his property,"
79948,79949,Richard II,18.0,3.2.136,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
79949,79950,Richard II,18.0,3.2.137,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Again uncurse their souls, their peace is made"
79950,79951,Richard II,18.0,3.2.138,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"With heads, and not with hands, those whom you curse"
79951,79952,Richard II,18.0,3.2.139,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
79952,79953,Richard II,18.0,3.2.140,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground."
79953,79954,Richard II,19.0,3.2.141,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?"
79954,79955,Richard II,20.0,3.2.142,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads."
79955,79956,Richard II,21.0,3.2.143,DUKE OF AUMERLE,Where is the duke my father with his power?
79956,79957,Richard II,22.0,3.2.144,KING RICHARD II,"No matter where, of comfort no man speak:"
79957,79958,Richard II,22.0,3.2.145,KING RICHARD II,"Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,"
79958,79959,Richard II,22.0,3.2.146,KING RICHARD II,Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
79959,79960,Richard II,22.0,3.2.147,KING RICHARD II,"Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,"
79960,79961,Richard II,22.0,3.2.148,KING RICHARD II,Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
79961,79962,Richard II,22.0,3.2.149,KING RICHARD II,"And yet not so, for what can we bequeath"
79962,79963,Richard II,22.0,3.2.150,KING RICHARD II,Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
79963,79964,Richard II,22.0,3.2.151,KING RICHARD II,"Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,"
79964,79965,Richard II,22.0,3.2.152,KING RICHARD II,And nothing can we call our own but death
79965,79966,Richard II,22.0,3.2.153,KING RICHARD II,And that small model of the barren earth
79966,79967,Richard II,22.0,3.2.154,KING RICHARD II,Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
79967,79968,Richard II,22.0,3.2.155,KING RICHARD II,"For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground"
79968,79969,Richard II,22.0,3.2.156,KING RICHARD II,"And tell sad stories of the death of kings,"
79969,79970,Richard II,22.0,3.2.157,KING RICHARD II,"How some have been deposed, some slain in war,"
79970,79971,Richard II,22.0,3.2.158,KING RICHARD II,"Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,"
79971,79972,Richard II,22.0,3.2.159,KING RICHARD II,"Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd,"
79972,79973,Richard II,22.0,3.2.160,KING RICHARD II,All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
79973,79974,Richard II,22.0,3.2.161,KING RICHARD II,That rounds the mortal temples of a king
79974,79975,Richard II,22.0,3.2.162,KING RICHARD II,"Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,"
79975,79976,Richard II,22.0,3.2.163,KING RICHARD II,"Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,"
79976,79977,Richard II,22.0,3.2.164,KING RICHARD II,"Allowing him a breath, a little scene,"
79977,79978,Richard II,22.0,3.2.165,KING RICHARD II,"To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,"
79978,79979,Richard II,22.0,3.2.166,KING RICHARD II,"Infusing him with self and vain conceit,"
79979,79980,Richard II,22.0,3.2.167,KING RICHARD II,"As if this flesh which walls about our life,"
79980,79981,Richard II,22.0,3.2.168,KING RICHARD II,"Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus"
79981,79982,Richard II,22.0,3.2.169,KING RICHARD II,Comes at the last and with a little pin
79982,79983,Richard II,22.0,3.2.170,KING RICHARD II,"Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!"
79983,79984,Richard II,22.0,3.2.171,KING RICHARD II,Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
79984,79985,Richard II,22.0,3.2.172,KING RICHARD II,"With solemn reverence: throw away respect,"
79985,79986,Richard II,22.0,3.2.173,KING RICHARD II,"Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,"
79986,79987,Richard II,22.0,3.2.174,KING RICHARD II,For you have but mistook me all this while:
79987,79988,Richard II,22.0,3.2.175,KING RICHARD II,"I live with bread like you, feel want,"
79988,79989,Richard II,22.0,3.2.176,KING RICHARD II,"Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,"
79989,79990,Richard II,22.0,3.2.177,KING RICHARD II,"How can you say to me, I am a king?"
79990,79991,Richard II,23.0,3.2.178,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,"
79991,79992,Richard II,23.0,3.2.179,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,But presently prevent the ways to wail.
79992,79993,Richard II,23.0,3.2.180,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,"
79993,79994,Richard II,23.0,3.2.181,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,"
79994,79995,Richard II,23.0,3.2.182,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,And so your follies fight against yourself.
79995,79996,Richard II,23.0,3.2.183,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Fear and be slain, no worse can come to fight:"
79996,79997,Richard II,23.0,3.2.184,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And fight and die is death destroying death,"
79997,79998,Richard II,23.0,3.2.185,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
79998,79999,Richard II,24.0,3.2.186,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My father hath a power, inquire of him"
79999,80000,Richard II,24.0,3.2.187,DUKE OF AUMERLE,And learn to make a body of a limb.
80000,80001,Richard II,25.0,3.2.188,KING RICHARD II,"Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come"
80001,80002,Richard II,25.0,3.2.189,KING RICHARD II,To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
80002,80003,Richard II,25.0,3.2.190,KING RICHARD II,"This ague fit of fear is over-blown,"
80003,80004,Richard II,25.0,3.2.191,KING RICHARD II,An easy task it is to win our own.
80004,80005,Richard II,25.0,3.2.192,KING RICHARD II,"Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?"
80005,80006,Richard II,25.0,3.2.193,KING RICHARD II,"Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour."
80006,80007,Richard II,26.0,3.2.194,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,Men judge by the complexion of the sky
80007,80008,Richard II,26.0,3.2.195,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,The state and inclination of the day:
80008,80009,Richard II,26.0,3.2.196,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"So may you by my dull and heavy eye,"
80009,80010,Richard II,26.0,3.2.197,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
80010,80011,Richard II,26.0,3.2.198,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"I play the torturer, by small and small"
80011,80012,Richard II,26.0,3.2.199,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
80012,80013,Richard II,26.0,3.2.200,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,"
80013,80014,Richard II,26.0,3.2.201,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,"And all your northern castles yielded up,"
80014,80015,Richard II,26.0,3.2.202,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,And all your southern gentlemen in arms
80015,80016,Richard II,26.0,3.2.203,SIR STEPHEN SCROOP,Upon his party.
80016,80017,Richard II,27.0,3.2.204,KING RICHARD II,Thou hast said enough.
80017,80018,Richard II,27.0,3.2.205,KING RICHARD II,"Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth"
80018,80019,Richard II,27.0,,KING RICHARD II,To DUKE OF AUMERLE
80019,80020,Richard II,27.0,3.2.206,KING RICHARD II,Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
80020,80021,Richard II,27.0,3.2.207,KING RICHARD II,What say you now? what comfort have we now?
80021,80022,Richard II,27.0,3.2.208,KING RICHARD II,"By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly"
80022,80023,Richard II,27.0,3.2.209,KING RICHARD II,That bids me be of comfort any more.
80023,80024,Richard II,27.0,3.2.210,KING RICHARD II,"Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away,"
80024,80025,Richard II,27.0,3.2.211,KING RICHARD II,"A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey."
80025,80026,Richard II,27.0,3.2.212,KING RICHARD II,"That power I have, discharge, and let them go"
80026,80027,Richard II,27.0,3.2.213,KING RICHARD II,"To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,"
80027,80028,Richard II,27.0,3.2.214,KING RICHARD II,For I have none: let no man speak again
80028,80029,Richard II,27.0,3.2.215,KING RICHARD II,"To alter this, for counsel is but vain."
80029,80030,Richard II,28.0,3.2.216,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My liege, one word."
80030,80031,Richard II,29.0,3.2.217,KING RICHARD II,He does me double wrong
80031,80032,Richard II,29.0,3.2.218,KING RICHARD II,That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
80032,80033,Richard II,29.0,3.2.219,KING RICHARD II,"Discharge my followers: let them hence away,"
80033,80034,Richard II,29.0,3.2.220,KING RICHARD II,From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
80034,80035,Richard II,29.0,,KING RICHARD II,Exeunt
80035,80036,Richard II,29.0,,KING RICHARD II,SCENE III. Wales. Before Flint castle.
80036,80037,Richard II,29.0,,KING RICHARD II,"Enter, with drum and colours, HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, and forces"
80037,80038,Richard II,1.0,3.3.1,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,So that by this intelligence we learn
80038,80039,Richard II,1.0,3.3.2,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury"
80039,80040,Richard II,1.0,3.3.3,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed"
80040,80041,Richard II,1.0,3.3.4,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,With some few private friends upon this coast.
80041,80042,Richard II,2.0,3.3.5,NORTHUMBERLAND,"The news is very fair and good, my lord:"
80042,80043,Richard II,2.0,3.3.6,NORTHUMBERLAND,Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
80043,80044,Richard II,3.0,3.3.7,DUKE OF YORK,It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
80044,80045,Richard II,3.0,3.3.8,DUKE OF YORK,To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
80045,80046,Richard II,3.0,3.3.9,DUKE OF YORK,When such a sacred king should hide his head.
80046,80047,Richard II,4.0,3.3.10,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Your grace mistakes, only to be brief"
80047,80048,Richard II,4.0,3.3.11,NORTHUMBERLAND,Left I his title out.
80048,80049,Richard II,5.0,3.3.12,DUKE OF YORK,"The time hath been,"
80049,80050,Richard II,5.0,3.3.13,DUKE OF YORK,"Would you have been so brief with him, he would"
80050,80051,Richard II,5.0,3.3.14,DUKE OF YORK,"Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,"
80051,80052,Richard II,5.0,3.3.15,DUKE OF YORK,"For taking so the head, your whole head's length."
80052,80053,Richard II,6.0,3.3.16,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Mistake not, uncle, further than you should."
80053,80054,Richard II,7.0,3.3.17,DUKE OF YORK,"Take not, good cousin, further than you should."
80054,80055,Richard II,7.0,3.3.18,DUKE OF YORK,Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.
80055,80056,Richard II,8.0,3.3.19,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself"
80056,80057,Richard II,8.0,3.3.20,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Against their will. But who comes here?
80057,80058,Richard II,8.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Enter HENRY PERCY
80058,80059,Richard II,8.0,3.3.21,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?"
80059,80060,Richard II,9.0,3.3.22,HENRY PERCY,"The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,"
80060,80061,Richard II,9.0,3.3.23,HENRY PERCY,Against thy entrance.
80061,80062,Richard II,10.0,3.3.24,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Royally!
80062,80063,Richard II,10.0,3.3.25,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Why, it contains no king?"
80063,80064,Richard II,11.0,3.3.26,HENRY PERCY,"Yes, my good lord,"
80064,80065,Richard II,11.0,3.3.27,HENRY PERCY,"It doth contain a king, King Richard lies"
80065,80066,Richard II,11.0,3.3.28,HENRY PERCY,Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
80066,80067,Richard II,11.0,3.3.29,HENRY PERCY,"And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,"
80067,80068,Richard II,11.0,3.3.30,HENRY PERCY,"Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman"
80068,80069,Richard II,11.0,3.3.31,HENRY PERCY,"Of holy reverence, who, I cannot learn."
80069,80070,Richard II,12.0,3.3.32,NORTHUMBERLAND,"O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle."
80070,80071,Richard II,13.0,3.3.33,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Noble lords,"
80071,80072,Richard II,13.0,3.3.34,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle,"
80072,80073,Richard II,13.0,3.3.35,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
80073,80074,Richard II,13.0,3.3.36,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:"
80074,80075,Richard II,13.0,3.3.37,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Henry Bolingbroke
80075,80076,Richard II,13.0,3.3.38,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
80076,80077,Richard II,13.0,3.3.39,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
80077,80078,Richard II,13.0,3.3.40,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To his most royal person, hither come"
80078,80079,Richard II,13.0,3.3.41,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,"
80079,80080,Richard II,13.0,3.3.42,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Provided that my banishment repeal'd
80080,80081,Richard II,13.0,3.3.43,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And lands restored again be freely granted:
80081,80082,Richard II,13.0,3.3.44,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"If not, I'll use the advantage of my power"
80082,80083,Richard II,13.0,3.3.45,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
80083,80084,Richard II,13.0,3.3.46,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
80084,80085,Richard II,13.0,3.3.47,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke"
80085,80086,Richard II,13.0,3.3.48,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench"
80086,80087,Richard II,13.0,3.3.49,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,"
80087,80088,Richard II,13.0,3.3.50,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
80088,80089,Richard II,13.0,3.3.51,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go, signify as much, while here we march"
80089,80090,Richard II,13.0,3.3.52,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
80090,80091,Richard II,13.0,3.3.53,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,"
80091,80092,Richard II,13.0,3.3.54,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
80092,80093,Richard II,13.0,3.3.55,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Our fair appointments may be well perused.
80093,80094,Richard II,13.0,3.3.56,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
80094,80095,Richard II,13.0,3.3.57,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,With no less terror than the elements
80095,80096,Richard II,13.0,3.3.58,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of fire and water, when their thundering shock"
80096,80097,Richard II,13.0,3.3.59,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
80097,80098,Richard II,13.0,3.3.60,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:"
80098,80099,Richard II,13.0,3.3.61,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain"
80099,80100,Richard II,13.0,3.3.62,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My waters, on the earth, and not on him."
80100,80101,Richard II,13.0,3.3.63,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"March on, and mark King Richard how he looks."
80101,80102,Richard II,13.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish.  Enter on the walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF  CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and EARL OF SALISBURY"
80102,80103,Richard II,13.0,3.3.64,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,"
80103,80104,Richard II,13.0,3.3.65,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,As doth the blushing discontented sun
80104,80105,Richard II,13.0,3.3.66,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"From out the fiery portal of the east,"
80105,80106,Richard II,13.0,3.3.67,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
80106,80107,Richard II,13.0,3.3.68,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,To dim his glory and to stain the track
80107,80108,Richard II,13.0,3.3.69,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Of his bright passage to the occident.
80108,80109,Richard II,14.0,3.3.70,DUKE OF YORK,"Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,"
80109,80110,Richard II,14.0,3.3.71,DUKE OF YORK,"As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth"
80110,80111,Richard II,14.0,3.3.72,DUKE OF YORK,"Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,"
80111,80112,Richard II,14.0,3.3.73,DUKE OF YORK,That any harm should stain so fair a show!
80112,80113,Richard II,15.0,3.3.74,KING RICHARD II,"We are amazed, and thus long have we stood"
80113,80114,Richard II,15.0,3.3.75,KING RICHARD II,"To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,"
80114,80115,Richard II,15.0,,KING RICHARD II,To NORTHUMBERLAND
80115,80116,Richard II,15.0,3.3.76,KING RICHARD II,Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
80116,80117,Richard II,15.0,3.3.77,KING RICHARD II,"And if we be, how dare thy joints forget"
80117,80118,Richard II,15.0,3.3.78,KING RICHARD II,To pay their awful duty to our presence?
80118,80119,Richard II,15.0,3.3.79,KING RICHARD II,"If we be not, show us the hand of God"
80119,80120,Richard II,15.0,3.3.80,KING RICHARD II,"That hath dismissed us from our stewardship,"
80120,80121,Richard II,15.0,3.3.81,KING RICHARD II,"For well we know, no hand of blood and bone"
80121,80122,Richard II,15.0,3.3.82,KING RICHARD II,"Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,"
80122,80123,Richard II,15.0,3.3.83,KING RICHARD II,"Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp."
80123,80124,Richard II,15.0,3.3.84,KING RICHARD II,"And though you think that all, as you have done,"
80124,80125,Richard II,15.0,3.3.85,KING RICHARD II,"Have torn their souls by turning them from us,"
80125,80126,Richard II,15.0,3.3.86,KING RICHARD II,"And we are barren and bereft of friends,"
80126,80127,Richard II,15.0,3.3.87,KING RICHARD II,"Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,"
80127,80128,Richard II,15.0,3.3.88,KING RICHARD II,Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
80128,80129,Richard II,15.0,3.3.89,KING RICHARD II,"Armies of pestilence, and they shall strike"
80129,80130,Richard II,15.0,3.3.90,KING RICHARD II,"Your children yet unborn and unbegot,"
80130,80131,Richard II,15.0,3.3.91,KING RICHARD II,That lift your vassal hands against my head
80131,80132,Richard II,15.0,3.3.92,KING RICHARD II,And threat the glory of my precious crown.
80132,80133,Richard II,15.0,3.3.93,KING RICHARD II,Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
80133,80134,Richard II,15.0,3.3.94,KING RICHARD II,That every stride he makes upon my land
80134,80135,Richard II,15.0,3.3.95,KING RICHARD II,Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
80135,80136,Richard II,15.0,3.3.96,KING RICHARD II,"The purple testament of bleeding war,"
80136,80137,Richard II,15.0,3.3.97,KING RICHARD II,"But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,"
80137,80138,Richard II,15.0,3.3.98,KING RICHARD II,Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
80138,80139,Richard II,15.0,3.3.99,KING RICHARD II,"Shall ill become the flower of England's face,"
80139,80140,Richard II,15.0,3.3.100,KING RICHARD II,Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
80140,80141,Richard II,15.0,3.3.101,KING RICHARD II,To scarlet indignation and bedew
80141,80142,Richard II,15.0,3.3.102,KING RICHARD II,Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.
80142,80143,Richard II,16.0,3.3.103,NORTHUMBERLAND,The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
80143,80144,Richard II,16.0,3.3.104,NORTHUMBERLAND,Should so with civil and uncivil arms
80144,80145,Richard II,16.0,3.3.105,NORTHUMBERLAND,Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
80145,80146,Richard II,16.0,3.3.106,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand,"
80146,80147,Richard II,16.0,3.3.107,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And by the honourable tomb he swears,"

80151,80152,Richard II,16.0,3.3.112,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And by the worth and honour of himself,"
80152,80153,Richard II,16.0,3.3.113,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Comprising all that may be sworn or said,"
80153,80154,Richard II,16.0,3.3.114,NORTHUMBERLAND,His coming hither hath no further scope
80154,80155,Richard II,16.0,3.3.115,NORTHUMBERLAND,Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
80155,80156,Richard II,16.0,3.3.116,NORTHUMBERLAND,Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:
80156,80157,Richard II,16.0,3.3.117,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which on thy royal party granted once,"
80157,80158,Richard II,16.0,3.3.118,NORTHUMBERLAND,"His glittering arms he will commend to rust,"

80161,80162,Richard II,16.0,3.3.122,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him."
80162,80163,Richard II,17.0,3.3.123,KING RICHARD II,"Northumberland, say thus the king returns:"
80163,80164,Richard II,17.0,3.3.124,KING RICHARD II,"His noble cousin is right welcome hither,"
80164,80165,Richard II,17.0,3.3.125,KING RICHARD II,And all the number of his fair demands
80165,80166,Richard II,17.0,3.3.126,KING RICHARD II,Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:

80169,80170,Richard II,17.0,,KING RICHARD II,To DUKE OF AUMERLE
80170,80171,Richard II,17.0,3.3.130,KING RICHARD II,To look so poorly and to speak so fair?

80172,80173,Richard II,17.0,3.3.132,KING RICHARD II,"Defiance to the traitor, and so die?"
80173,80174,Richard II,18.0,3.3.133,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"No, good my lord, let's fight with gentle words"
80174,80175,Richard II,18.0,3.3.134,DUKE OF AUMERLE,Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
80175,80176,Richard II,19.0,3.3.135,KING RICHARD II,"O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,"
80176,80177,Richard II,19.0,3.3.136,KING RICHARD II,That laid the sentence of dread banishment
80177,80178,Richard II,19.0,3.3.137,KING RICHARD II,"On yon proud man, should take it off again"
80178,80179,Richard II,19.0,3.3.138,KING RICHARD II,With words of sooth! O that I were as great
80179,80180,Richard II,19.0,3.3.139,KING RICHARD II,"As is my grief, or lesser than my name!"
80180,80181,Richard II,19.0,3.3.140,KING RICHARD II,"Or that I could forget what I have been,"
80181,80182,Richard II,19.0,3.3.141,KING RICHARD II,Or not remember what I must be now!
80182,80183,Richard II,19.0,3.3.142,KING RICHARD II,"Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,"
80183,80184,Richard II,19.0,3.3.143,KING RICHARD II,Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.
80184,80185,Richard II,20.0,3.3.144,DUKE OF AUMERLE,Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.

80186,80187,Richard II,21.0,3.3.146,KING RICHARD II,The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
80187,80188,Richard II,21.0,3.3.147,KING RICHARD II,The king shall be contented: must he lose

80197,80198,Richard II,21.0,3.3.157,KING RICHARD II,"Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,"
80198,80199,Richard II,21.0,3.3.158,KING RICHARD II,"Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet"
80199,80200,Richard II,21.0,3.3.159,KING RICHARD II,"May hourly trample on their sovereign's head,"
80200,80201,Richard II,21.0,3.3.160,KING RICHARD II,"For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,"

80202,80203,Richard II,21.0,3.3.162,KING RICHARD II,"Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!"

80205,80206,Richard II,21.0,3.3.165,KING RICHARD II,And make a dearth in this revolting land.
80206,80207,Richard II,21.0,3.3.166,KING RICHARD II,"Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,"
80207,80208,Richard II,21.0,3.3.167,KING RICHARD II,And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
80208,80209,Richard II,21.0,3.3.168,KING RICHARD II,"As thus, to drop them still upon one place,"
80209,80210,Richard II,21.0,3.3.169,KING RICHARD II,Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
80210,80211,Richard II,21.0,3.3.170,KING RICHARD II,"Within the earth, and, therein laid,--there lies"
80211,80212,Richard II,21.0,3.3.171,KING RICHARD II,Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
80212,80213,Richard II,21.0,3.3.172,KING RICHARD II,"Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see"
80213,80214,Richard II,21.0,3.3.173,KING RICHARD II,"I talk but idly, and you laugh at me."

80215,80216,Richard II,21.0,3.3.175,KING RICHARD II,What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
80216,80217,Richard II,21.0,3.3.176,KING RICHARD II,Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
80217,80218,Richard II,21.0,3.3.177,KING RICHARD II,"You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay."
80218,80219,Richard II,22.0,3.3.178,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord, in the base court he doth attend"
80219,80220,Richard II,22.0,3.3.179,NORTHUMBERLAND,"To speak with you, may it please you to come down."
80220,80221,Richard II,23.0,3.3.180,KING RICHARD II,"Down, down I come, like glistering Phaethon,"
80221,80222,Richard II,23.0,3.3.181,KING RICHARD II,Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
80222,80223,Richard II,23.0,3.3.182,KING RICHARD II,"In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,"
80223,80224,Richard II,23.0,3.3.183,KING RICHARD II,To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
80224,80225,Richard II,23.0,3.3.184,KING RICHARD II,"In the base court? Come down? Down, court!"
80225,80226,Richard II,23.0,3.3.185,KING RICHARD II,"down, king!"
80226,80227,Richard II,23.0,3.3.186,KING RICHARD II,For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
80227,80228,Richard II,23.0,3.3.187,KING RICHARD II,should sing.
80228,80229,Richard II,23.0,,KING RICHARD II,Exeunt from above
80229,80230,Richard II,24.0,3.3.188,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,What says his majesty?

80231,80232,Richard II,25.0,3.3.190,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man"

80236,80237,Richard II,26.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,He kneels down
80237,80238,Richard II,26.0,3.3.194,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious lord,--"
80238,80239,Richard II,27.0,3.3.195,KING RICHARD II,"Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee"
80239,80240,Richard II,27.0,3.3.196,KING RICHARD II,To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
80240,80241,Richard II,27.0,3.3.197,KING RICHARD II,Me rather had my heart might feel your love
80241,80242,Richard II,27.0,3.3.198,KING RICHARD II,Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
80242,80243,Richard II,27.0,3.3.199,KING RICHARD II,"Up, cousin, up, your heart is up, I know,"
80243,80244,Richard II,27.0,3.3.200,KING RICHARD II,"Thus high at least, although your knee be low."
80244,80245,Richard II,28.0,3.3.201,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"My gracious lord, I come but for mine own."
80245,80246,Richard II,29.0,3.3.202,KING RICHARD II,"Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all."
80246,80247,Richard II,30.0,3.3.203,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,"
80247,80248,Richard II,30.0,3.3.204,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,As my true service shall deserve your love.
80248,80249,Richard II,31.0,3.3.205,KING RICHARD II,"Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,"
80249,80250,Richard II,31.0,3.3.206,KING RICHARD II,That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
80250,80251,Richard II,31.0,3.3.207,KING RICHARD II,"Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes,"
80251,80252,Richard II,31.0,3.3.208,KING RICHARD II,"Tears show their love, but want their remedies."
80252,80253,Richard II,31.0,3.3.209,KING RICHARD II,"Cousin, I am too young to be your father,"
80253,80254,Richard II,31.0,3.3.210,KING RICHARD II,Though you are old enough to be my heir.
80254,80255,Richard II,31.0,3.3.211,KING RICHARD II,"What you will have, I'll give, and willing too,"
80255,80256,Richard II,31.0,3.3.212,KING RICHARD II,For do we must what force will have us do.
80256,80257,Richard II,31.0,3.3.213,KING RICHARD II,"Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?"
80257,80258,Richard II,32.0,3.3.214,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Yea, my good lord."
80258,80259,Richard II,33.0,3.3.215,KING RICHARD II,Then I must not say no.

80262,80263,Richard II,1.0,3.4.1,QUEEN,"What sport shall we devise here in this garden,"
80263,80264,Richard II,1.0,3.4.2,QUEEN,To drive away the heavy thought of care?
80264,80265,Richard II,2.0,3.4.3,Lady,"Madam, we'll play at bowls."
80265,80266,Richard II,3.0,3.4.4,QUEEN,"'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,"
80266,80267,Richard II,3.0,3.4.5,QUEEN,And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
80267,80268,Richard II,4.0,3.4.6,Lady,"Madam, we'll dance."
80268,80269,Richard II,5.0,3.4.7,QUEEN,"My legs can keep no measure in delight,"
80269,80270,Richard II,5.0,3.4.8,QUEEN,When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
80270,80271,Richard II,5.0,3.4.9,QUEEN,"Therefore, no dancing, girl, some other sport."
80271,80272,Richard II,6.0,3.4.10,Lady,"Madam, we'll tell tales."
80272,80273,Richard II,7.0,3.4.11,QUEEN,Of sorrow or of joy?
80273,80274,Richard II,8.0,3.4.12,Lady,"Of either, madam."
80274,80275,Richard II,9.0,3.4.13,QUEEN,"Of neither, girl:"
80275,80276,Richard II,9.0,3.4.14,QUEEN,"For of joy, being altogether wanting,"
80276,80277,Richard II,9.0,3.4.15,QUEEN,"It doth remember me the more of sorrow,"
80277,80278,Richard II,9.0,3.4.16,QUEEN,"Or if of grief, being altogether had,"
80278,80279,Richard II,9.0,3.4.17,QUEEN,It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
80279,80280,Richard II,9.0,3.4.18,QUEEN,"For what I have I need not to repeat,"
80280,80281,Richard II,9.0,3.4.19,QUEEN,And what I want it boots not to complain.
80281,80282,Richard II,10.0,3.4.20,Lady,"Madam, I'll sing."
80282,80283,Richard II,11.0,3.4.21,QUEEN,'Tis well that thou hast cause
80283,80284,Richard II,11.0,3.4.22,QUEEN,"But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep."
80284,80285,Richard II,12.0,3.4.23,Lady,"I could weep, madam, would it do you good."
80285,80286,Richard II,13.0,3.4.24,QUEEN,"And I could sing, would weeping do me good,"
80286,80287,Richard II,13.0,3.4.25,QUEEN,And never borrow any tear of thee.
80287,80288,Richard II,13.0,,QUEEN,"Enter a Gardener, and two Servants"
80288,80289,Richard II,13.0,3.4.26,QUEEN,"But stay, here come the gardeners:"
80289,80290,Richard II,13.0,3.4.27,QUEEN,Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
80290,80291,Richard II,13.0,3.4.28,QUEEN,"My wretchedness unto a row of pins,"
80291,80292,Richard II,13.0,3.4.29,QUEEN,"They'll talk of state, for every one doth so"
80292,80293,Richard II,13.0,3.4.30,QUEEN,"Against a change, woe is forerun with woe."
80293,80294,Richard II,13.0,,QUEEN,QUEEN and Ladies retire
80294,80295,Richard II,14.0,3.4.31,Gardener,"Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,"
80295,80296,Richard II,14.0,3.4.32,Gardener,"Which, like unruly children, make their sire"
80296,80297,Richard II,14.0,3.4.33,Gardener,Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
80297,80298,Richard II,14.0,3.4.34,Gardener,Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
80298,80299,Richard II,14.0,3.4.35,Gardener,"Go thou, and like an executioner,"
80299,80300,Richard II,14.0,3.4.36,Gardener,"Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,"
80300,80301,Richard II,14.0,3.4.37,Gardener,That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
80301,80302,Richard II,14.0,3.4.38,Gardener,All must be even in our government.
80302,80303,Richard II,14.0,3.4.39,Gardener,"You thus employ'd, I will go root away"
80303,80304,Richard II,14.0,3.4.40,Gardener,"The noisome weeds, which without profit suck"
80304,80305,Richard II,14.0,3.4.41,Gardener,The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
80305,80306,Richard II,15.0,3.4.42,Servant,Why should we in the compass of a pale
80306,80307,Richard II,15.0,3.4.43,Servant,"Keep law and form and due proportion,"
80307,80308,Richard II,15.0,3.4.44,Servant,"Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,"
80308,80309,Richard II,15.0,3.4.45,Servant,"When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,"
80309,80310,Richard II,15.0,3.4.46,Servant,"Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,"
80310,80311,Richard II,15.0,3.4.47,Servant,"Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,"
80311,80312,Richard II,15.0,3.4.48,Servant,Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
80312,80313,Richard II,15.0,3.4.49,Servant,Swarming with caterpillars?
80313,80314,Richard II,16.0,3.4.50,Gardener,Hold thy peace:
80314,80315,Richard II,16.0,3.4.51,Gardener,He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
80315,80316,Richard II,16.0,3.4.52,Gardener,Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
80316,80317,Richard II,16.0,3.4.53,Gardener,"The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,"
80317,80318,Richard II,16.0,3.4.54,Gardener,"That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,"
80318,80319,Richard II,16.0,3.4.55,Gardener,"Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,"
80319,80320,Richard II,16.0,3.4.56,Gardener,"I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green."
80320,80321,Richard II,17.0,3.4.57,Servant,"What, are they dead?"
80321,80322,Richard II,18.0,3.4.58,Gardener,"They are, and Bolingbroke"
80322,80323,Richard II,18.0,3.4.59,Gardener,"Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it"
80323,80324,Richard II,18.0,3.4.60,Gardener,That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
80324,80325,Richard II,18.0,3.4.61,Gardener,As we this garden! We at time of year
80325,80326,Richard II,18.0,3.4.62,Gardener,"Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,"
80326,80327,Richard II,18.0,3.4.63,Gardener,"Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,"
80327,80328,Richard II,18.0,3.4.64,Gardener,With too much riches it confound itself:
80328,80329,Richard II,18.0,3.4.65,Gardener,"Had he done so to great and growing men,"
80329,80330,Richard II,18.0,3.4.66,Gardener,They might have lived to bear and he to taste
80330,80331,Richard II,18.0,3.4.67,Gardener,Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
80331,80332,Richard II,18.0,3.4.68,Gardener,"We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:"
80332,80333,Richard II,18.0,3.4.69,Gardener,"Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,"
80333,80334,Richard II,18.0,3.4.70,Gardener,Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
80334,80335,Richard II,19.0,3.4.71,Servant,"What, think you then the king shall be deposed?"
80335,80336,Richard II,20.0,3.4.72,Gardener,"Depress'd he is already, and deposed"
80336,80337,Richard II,20.0,3.4.73,Gardener,'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
80337,80338,Richard II,20.0,3.4.74,Gardener,"To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,"
80338,80339,Richard II,20.0,3.4.75,Gardener,That tell black tidings.
80339,80340,Richard II,21.0,3.4.76,QUEEN,"O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!"
80340,80341,Richard II,21.0,,QUEEN,Coming forward
80341,80342,Richard II,21.0,3.4.77,QUEEN,"Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,"
80342,80343,Richard II,21.0,3.4.78,QUEEN,How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
80343,80344,Richard II,21.0,3.4.79,QUEEN,"What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee"
80344,80345,Richard II,21.0,3.4.80,QUEEN,To make a second fall of cursed man?
80345,80346,Richard II,21.0,3.4.81,QUEEN,Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
80346,80347,Richard II,21.0,3.4.82,QUEEN,"Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,"
80347,80348,Richard II,21.0,3.4.83,QUEEN,"Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,"
80348,80349,Richard II,21.0,3.4.84,QUEEN,"Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch."
80349,80350,Richard II,22.0,3.4.85,Gardener,"Pardon me, madam: little joy have I"
80350,80351,Richard II,22.0,3.4.86,Gardener,"To breathe this news, yet what I say is true."
80351,80352,Richard II,22.0,3.4.87,Gardener,"King Richard, he is in the mighty hold"
80352,80353,Richard II,22.0,3.4.88,Gardener,Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
80353,80354,Richard II,22.0,3.4.89,Gardener,"In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,"
80354,80355,Richard II,22.0,3.4.90,Gardener,"And some few vanities that make him light,"
80355,80356,Richard II,22.0,3.4.91,Gardener,"But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,"
80356,80357,Richard II,22.0,3.4.92,Gardener,"Besides himself, are all the English peers,"
80357,80358,Richard II,22.0,3.4.93,Gardener,And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
80358,80359,Richard II,22.0,3.4.94,Gardener,"Post you to London, and you will find it so,"
80359,80360,Richard II,22.0,3.4.95,Gardener,I speak no more than every one doth know.
80360,80361,Richard II,23.0,3.4.96,QUEEN,"Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,"
80361,80362,Richard II,23.0,3.4.97,QUEEN,"Doth not thy embassage belong to me,"
80362,80363,Richard II,23.0,3.4.98,QUEEN,"And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st"
80363,80364,Richard II,23.0,3.4.99,QUEEN,"To serve me last, that I may longest keep"
80364,80365,Richard II,23.0,3.4.100,QUEEN,"Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,"
80365,80366,Richard II,23.0,3.4.101,QUEEN,To meet at London London's king in woe.
80366,80367,Richard II,23.0,3.4.102,QUEEN,"What, was I born to this, that my sad look"
80367,80368,Richard II,23.0,3.4.103,QUEEN,Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
80368,80369,Richard II,23.0,3.4.104,QUEEN,"Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,"
80369,80370,Richard II,23.0,3.4.105,QUEEN,Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.

80372,80373,Richard II,24.0,3.4.107,GARDENER,I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
80373,80374,Richard II,24.0,3.4.108,GARDENER,"Here did she fall a tear, here in this place"
80374,80375,Richard II,24.0,3.4.109,GARDENER,"I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:"
80375,80376,Richard II,24.0,3.4.110,GARDENER,"Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,"
80376,80377,Richard II,24.0,3.4.111,GARDENER,In the remembrance of a weeping queen.

80384,80385,Richard II,1.0,4.1.4,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd"
80385,80386,Richard II,1.0,4.1.5,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,The bloody office of his timeless end.
80386,80387,Richard II,2.0,4.1.6,BAGOT,Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
80387,80388,Richard II,3.0,4.1.7,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man."

80394,80395,Richard II,4.0,4.1.14,BAGOT,"Amongst much other talk, that very time,"
80395,80396,Richard II,4.0,4.1.15,BAGOT,I heard you say that you had rather refuse
80396,80397,Richard II,4.0,4.1.16,BAGOT,The offer of an hundred thousand crowns

80405,80406,Richard II,5.0,4.1.25,DUKE OF AUMERLE,With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
80406,80407,Richard II,5.0,4.1.26,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"There is my gage, the manual seal of death,"
80407,80408,Richard II,5.0,4.1.27,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,"
80408,80409,Richard II,5.0,4.1.28,DUKE OF AUMERLE,And will maintain what thou hast said is false

80410,80411,Richard II,5.0,4.1.30,DUKE OF AUMERLE,To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

80416,80417,Richard II,8.0,4.1.36,LORD FITZWATER,"By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,"
80417,80418,Richard II,8.0,4.1.37,LORD FITZWATER,"I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it"
80418,80419,Richard II,8.0,4.1.38,LORD FITZWATER,That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
80419,80420,Richard II,8.0,4.1.39,LORD FITZWATER,"If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest,"
80420,80421,Richard II,8.0,4.1.40,LORD FITZWATER,"And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,"
80421,80422,Richard II,8.0,4.1.41,LORD FITZWATER,"Where it was forged, with my rapier's point."
80422,80423,Richard II,9.0,4.1.42,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day."
80423,80424,Richard II,10.0,4.1.43,LORD FITZWATER,"Now by my soul, I would it were this hour."
80424,80425,Richard II,11.0,4.1.44,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this."
80425,80426,Richard II,12.0,4.1.45,HENRY PERCY,"Aumerle, thou liest, his honour is as true"

80427,80428,Richard II,12.0,4.1.47,HENRY PERCY,"And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,"
80428,80429,Richard II,12.0,4.1.48,HENRY PERCY,To prove it on thee to the extremest point
80429,80430,Richard II,12.0,4.1.49,HENRY PERCY,"Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest."
80430,80431,Richard II,13.0,4.1.50,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"An if I do not, may my hands rot off"
80431,80432,Richard II,13.0,4.1.51,DUKE OF AUMERLE,And never brandish more revengeful steel
80432,80433,Richard II,13.0,4.1.52,DUKE OF AUMERLE,Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
80433,80434,Richard II,14.0,4.1.53,Lord,"I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle,"
80434,80435,Richard II,14.0,4.1.54,Lord,And spur thee on with full as many lies
80435,80436,Richard II,14.0,4.1.55,Lord,As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
80436,80437,Richard II,14.0,4.1.56,Lord,"From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn,"
80437,80438,Richard II,14.0,4.1.57,Lord,"Engage it to the trial, if thou darest."
80438,80439,Richard II,15.0,4.1.58,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:"
80439,80440,Richard II,15.0,4.1.59,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"I have a thousand spirits in one breast,"
80440,80441,Richard II,15.0,4.1.60,DUKE OF AUMERLE,To answer twenty thousand such as you.
80441,80442,Richard II,16.0,4.1.61,DUKE OF SURREY,"My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well"
80442,80443,Richard II,16.0,4.1.62,DUKE OF SURREY,The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
80443,80444,Richard II,17.0,4.1.63,LORD FITZWATER,"'Tis very true: you were in presence then,"
80444,80445,Richard II,17.0,4.1.64,LORD FITZWATER,And you can witness with me this is true.
80445,80446,Richard II,18.0,4.1.65,DUKE OF SURREY,"As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true."
80446,80447,Richard II,19.0,4.1.66,LORD FITZWATER,"Surrey, thou liest."
80447,80448,Richard II,20.0,4.1.67,DUKE OF SURREY,Dishonourable boy!
80448,80449,Richard II,20.0,4.1.68,DUKE OF SURREY,"That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,"
80449,80450,Richard II,20.0,4.1.69,DUKE OF SURREY,That it shall render vengeance and revenge
80450,80451,Richard II,20.0,4.1.70,DUKE OF SURREY,Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
80451,80452,Richard II,20.0,4.1.71,DUKE OF SURREY,In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
80452,80453,Richard II,20.0,4.1.72,DUKE OF SURREY,"In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn,"
80453,80454,Richard II,20.0,4.1.73,DUKE OF SURREY,"Engage it to the trial, if thou darest."
80454,80455,Richard II,21.0,4.1.74,LORD FITZWATER,How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
80455,80456,Richard II,21.0,4.1.75,LORD FITZWATER,"If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,"
80456,80457,Richard II,21.0,4.1.76,LORD FITZWATER,"I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,"
80457,80458,Richard II,21.0,4.1.77,LORD FITZWATER,"And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,"
80458,80459,Richard II,21.0,4.1.78,LORD FITZWATER,"And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,"
80459,80460,Richard II,21.0,4.1.79,LORD FITZWATER,To tie thee to my strong correction.
80460,80461,Richard II,21.0,4.1.80,LORD FITZWATER,"As I intend to thrive in this new world,"
80461,80462,Richard II,21.0,4.1.81,LORD FITZWATER,Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
80462,80463,Richard II,21.0,4.1.82,LORD FITZWATER,"Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say"
80463,80464,Richard II,21.0,4.1.83,LORD FITZWATER,"That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men"
80464,80465,Richard II,21.0,4.1.84,LORD FITZWATER,To execute the noble duke at Calais.
80465,80466,Richard II,22.0,4.1.85,DUKE OF AUMERLE,Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
80466,80467,Richard II,22.0,4.1.86,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,"
80467,80468,Richard II,22.0,4.1.87,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour."
80468,80469,Richard II,23.0,4.1.88,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,These differences shall all rest under gage
80469,80470,Richard II,23.0,4.1.89,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,"
80470,80471,Richard II,23.0,4.1.90,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"And, though mine enemy, restored again"
80471,80472,Richard II,23.0,4.1.91,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,"
80472,80473,Richard II,23.0,4.1.92,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
80473,80474,Richard II,24.0,4.1.93,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
80474,80475,Richard II,24.0,4.1.94,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
80475,80476,Richard II,24.0,4.1.95,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,"
80476,80477,Richard II,24.0,4.1.96,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
80477,80478,Richard II,24.0,4.1.97,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:"
80478,80479,Richard II,24.0,4.1.98,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And toil'd with works of war, retired himself"
80479,80480,Richard II,24.0,4.1.99,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"To Italy, and there at Venice gave"
80480,80481,Richard II,24.0,4.1.100,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"His body to that pleasant country's earth,"
80481,80482,Richard II,24.0,4.1.101,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,"
80482,80483,Richard II,24.0,4.1.102,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Under whose colours he had fought so long.
80483,80484,Richard II,25.0,4.1.103,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?"
80484,80485,Richard II,26.0,4.1.104,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"As surely as I live, my lord."
80485,80486,Richard II,27.0,4.1.105,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
80486,80487,Richard II,27.0,4.1.106,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,"
80487,80488,Richard II,27.0,4.1.107,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Your differences shall all rest under gage
80488,80489,Richard II,27.0,4.1.108,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Till we assign you to your days of trial.
80489,80490,Richard II,27.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended"
80490,80491,Richard II,28.0,4.1.109,DUKE OF YORK,"Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee"
80491,80492,Richard II,28.0,4.1.110,DUKE OF YORK,"From plume-pluck'd Richard, who with willing soul"
80492,80493,Richard II,28.0,4.1.111,DUKE OF YORK,"Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields"
80493,80494,Richard II,28.0,4.1.112,DUKE OF YORK,To the possession of thy royal hand:
80494,80495,Richard II,28.0,4.1.113,DUKE OF YORK,"Ascend his throne, descending now from him,"
80495,80496,Richard II,28.0,4.1.114,DUKE OF YORK,"And long live Henry, fourth of that name!"
80496,80497,Richard II,29.0,4.1.115,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne."
80497,80498,Richard II,30.0,4.1.116,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Marry. God forbid!
80498,80499,Richard II,30.0,4.1.117,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Worst in this royal presence may I speak,"
80499,80500,Richard II,30.0,4.1.118,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
80500,80501,Richard II,30.0,4.1.119,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Would God that any in this noble presence
80501,80502,Richard II,30.0,4.1.120,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Were enough noble to be upright judge
80502,80503,Richard II,30.0,4.1.121,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
80503,80504,Richard II,30.0,4.1.122,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
80504,80505,Richard II,30.0,4.1.123,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,What subject can give sentence on his king?
80505,80506,Richard II,30.0,4.1.124,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
80506,80507,Richard II,30.0,4.1.125,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,"
80507,80508,Richard II,30.0,4.1.126,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Although apparent guilt be seen in them,"

80512,80513,Richard II,30.0,4.1.131,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,"
80513,80514,Richard II,30.0,4.1.132,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,That in a Christian climate souls refined
80514,80515,Richard II,30.0,4.1.133,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!"
80515,80516,Richard II,30.0,4.1.134,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,"
80516,80517,Richard II,30.0,4.1.135,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:"
80517,80518,Richard II,30.0,4.1.136,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,"
80518,80519,Richard II,30.0,4.1.137,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
80519,80520,Richard II,30.0,4.1.138,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And if you crown him, let me prophesy:"
80520,80521,Richard II,30.0,4.1.139,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The blood of English shall manure the ground,"
80521,80522,Richard II,30.0,4.1.140,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"And future ages groan for this foul act,"
80522,80523,Richard II,30.0,4.1.141,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,"
80523,80524,Richard II,30.0,4.1.142,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
80524,80525,Richard II,30.0,4.1.143,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound,"
80525,80526,Richard II,30.0,4.1.144,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny"
80526,80527,Richard II,30.0,4.1.145,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd"
80527,80528,Richard II,30.0,4.1.146,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
80528,80529,Richard II,30.0,4.1.147,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"O, if you raise this house against this house,"
80529,80530,Richard II,30.0,4.1.148,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,It will the woefullest division prove
80530,80531,Richard II,30.0,4.1.149,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
80531,80532,Richard II,30.0,4.1.150,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,"
80532,80533,Richard II,30.0,4.1.151,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!"

80534,80535,Richard II,31.0,4.1.153,NORTHUMBERLAND,Of capital treason we arrest you here.

80543,80544,Richard II,34.0,4.1.161,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Lords, you that here are under our arrest,"
80544,80545,Richard II,34.0,4.1.162,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
80545,80546,Richard II,34.0,4.1.163,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Little are we beholding to your love,"
80546,80547,Richard II,34.0,4.1.164,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,And little look'd for at your helping hands.
80547,80548,Richard II,34.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Re-enter DUKE OF YORK, with KING RICHARD II, and Officers bearing the regalia"
80548,80549,Richard II,35.0,4.1.165,KING RICHARD II,"Alack, why am I sent for to a king,"
80549,80550,Richard II,35.0,4.1.166,KING RICHARD II,Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
80550,80551,Richard II,35.0,4.1.167,KING RICHARD II,Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
80551,80552,Richard II,35.0,4.1.168,KING RICHARD II,"To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:"
80552,80553,Richard II,35.0,4.1.169,KING RICHARD II,Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
80553,80554,Richard II,35.0,4.1.170,KING RICHARD II,To this submission. Yet I well remember
80554,80555,Richard II,35.0,4.1.171,KING RICHARD II,The favours of these men: were they not mine?
80555,80556,Richard II,35.0,4.1.172,KING RICHARD II,"Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?"
80556,80557,Richard II,35.0,4.1.173,KING RICHARD II,"So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,"
80557,80558,Richard II,35.0,4.1.174,KING RICHARD II,"Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none."
80558,80559,Richard II,35.0,4.1.175,KING RICHARD II,God save the king! Will no man say amen?
80559,80560,Richard II,35.0,4.1.176,KING RICHARD II,"Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen."
80560,80561,Richard II,35.0,4.1.177,KING RICHARD II,"God save the king! although I be not he,"
80561,80562,Richard II,35.0,4.1.178,KING RICHARD II,"And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me."
80562,80563,Richard II,35.0,4.1.179,KING RICHARD II,To do what service am I sent for hither?
80563,80564,Richard II,36.0,4.1.180,DUKE OF YORK,To do that office of thine own good will
80564,80565,Richard II,36.0,4.1.181,DUKE OF YORK,"Which tired majesty did make thee offer,"
80565,80566,Richard II,36.0,4.1.182,DUKE OF YORK,The resignation of thy state and crown
80566,80567,Richard II,36.0,4.1.183,DUKE OF YORK,To Henry Bolingbroke.
80567,80568,Richard II,37.0,4.1.184,KING RICHARD II,"Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown,"
80568,80569,Richard II,37.0,4.1.185,KING RICHARD II,Here cousin:
80569,80570,Richard II,37.0,4.1.186,KING RICHARD II,"On this side my hand, and on that side yours."
80570,80571,Richard II,37.0,4.1.187,KING RICHARD II,Now is this golden crown like a deep well
80571,80572,Richard II,37.0,4.1.188,KING RICHARD II,"That owes two buckets, filling one another,"
80572,80573,Richard II,37.0,4.1.189,KING RICHARD II,"The emptier ever dancing in the air,"
80573,80574,Richard II,37.0,4.1.190,KING RICHARD II,"The other down, unseen and full of water:"
80574,80575,Richard II,37.0,4.1.191,KING RICHARD II,"That bucket down and full of tears am I,"
80575,80576,Richard II,37.0,4.1.192,KING RICHARD II,"Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high."
80576,80577,Richard II,38.0,4.1.193,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,I thought you had been willing to resign.
80577,80578,Richard II,39.0,4.1.194,KING RICHARD II,"My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine:"
80578,80579,Richard II,39.0,4.1.195,KING RICHARD II,"You may my glories and my state depose,"
80579,80580,Richard II,39.0,4.1.196,KING RICHARD II,"But not my griefs, still am I king of those."
80580,80581,Richard II,40.0,4.1.197,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
80581,80582,Richard II,41.0,4.1.198,KING RICHARD II,Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
80582,80583,Richard II,41.0,4.1.199,KING RICHARD II,"My care is loss of care, by old care done,"
80583,80584,Richard II,41.0,4.1.200,KING RICHARD II,"Your care is gain of care, by new care won:"
80584,80585,Richard II,41.0,4.1.201,KING RICHARD II,"The cares I give I have, though given away,"
80585,80586,Richard II,41.0,4.1.202,KING RICHARD II,"They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay."
80586,80587,Richard II,42.0,4.1.203,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Are you contented to resign the crown?
80587,80588,Richard II,43.0,4.1.204,KING RICHARD II,"Ay, no, no, ay, for I must nothing be,"
80588,80589,Richard II,43.0,4.1.205,KING RICHARD II,"Therefore no no, for I resign to thee."
80589,80590,Richard II,43.0,4.1.206,KING RICHARD II,"Now mark me, how I will undo myself,"
80590,80591,Richard II,43.0,4.1.207,KING RICHARD II,I give this heavy weight from off my head
80591,80592,Richard II,43.0,4.1.208,KING RICHARD II,"And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,"
80592,80593,Richard II,43.0,4.1.209,KING RICHARD II,"The pride of kingly sway from out my heart,"
80593,80594,Richard II,43.0,4.1.210,KING RICHARD II,"With mine own tears I wash away my balm,"
80594,80595,Richard II,43.0,4.1.211,KING RICHARD II,"With mine own hands I give away my crown,"
80595,80596,Richard II,43.0,4.1.212,KING RICHARD II,"With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,"
80596,80597,Richard II,43.0,4.1.213,KING RICHARD II,With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
80597,80598,Richard II,43.0,4.1.214,KING RICHARD II,"All pomp and majesty I do forswear,"
80598,80599,Richard II,43.0,4.1.215,KING RICHARD II,"My manors, rents, revenues I forego,"
80599,80600,Richard II,43.0,4.1.216,KING RICHARD II,"My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:"
80600,80601,Richard II,43.0,4.1.217,KING RICHARD II,God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
80601,80602,Richard II,43.0,4.1.218,KING RICHARD II,God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
80602,80603,Richard II,43.0,4.1.219,KING RICHARD II,"Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,"
80603,80604,Richard II,43.0,4.1.220,KING RICHARD II,"And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!"
80604,80605,Richard II,43.0,4.1.221,KING RICHARD II,"Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,"
80605,80606,Richard II,43.0,4.1.222,KING RICHARD II,And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
80606,80607,Richard II,43.0,4.1.223,KING RICHARD II,"God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,"
80607,80608,Richard II,43.0,4.1.224,KING RICHARD II,And send him many years of sunshine days!
80608,80609,Richard II,43.0,4.1.225,KING RICHARD II,What more remains?
80609,80610,Richard II,44.0,4.1.226,NORTHUMBERLAND,"No more, but that you read"
80610,80611,Richard II,44.0,4.1.227,NORTHUMBERLAND,These accusations and these grievous crimes
80611,80612,Richard II,44.0,4.1.228,NORTHUMBERLAND,Committed by your person and your followers
80612,80613,Richard II,44.0,4.1.229,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Against the state and profit of this land,"
80613,80614,Richard II,44.0,4.1.230,NORTHUMBERLAND,"That, by confessing them, the souls of men"
80614,80615,Richard II,44.0,4.1.231,NORTHUMBERLAND,May deem that you are worthily deposed.
80615,80616,Richard II,45.0,4.1.232,KING RICHARD II,Must I do so? and must I ravel out
80616,80617,Richard II,45.0,4.1.233,KING RICHARD II,"My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,"
80617,80618,Richard II,45.0,4.1.234,KING RICHARD II,"If thy offences were upon record,"
80618,80619,Richard II,45.0,4.1.235,KING RICHARD II,Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
80619,80620,Richard II,45.0,4.1.236,KING RICHARD II,"To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,"
80620,80621,Richard II,45.0,4.1.237,KING RICHARD II,"There shouldst thou find one heinous article,"
80621,80622,Richard II,45.0,4.1.238,KING RICHARD II,Containing the deposing of a king
80622,80623,Richard II,45.0,4.1.239,KING RICHARD II,"And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,"
80623,80624,Richard II,45.0,4.1.240,KING RICHARD II,"Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:"
80624,80625,Richard II,45.0,4.1.241,KING RICHARD II,"Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,"
80625,80626,Richard II,45.0,4.1.242,KING RICHARD II,"Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,"
80626,80627,Richard II,45.0,4.1.243,KING RICHARD II,Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
80627,80628,Richard II,45.0,4.1.244,KING RICHARD II,"Showing an outward pity, yet you Pilates"
80628,80629,Richard II,45.0,4.1.245,KING RICHARD II,"Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,"
80629,80630,Richard II,45.0,4.1.246,KING RICHARD II,And water cannot wash away your sin.
80630,80631,Richard II,46.0,4.1.247,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord, dispatch, read o'er these articles."
80631,80632,Richard II,47.0,4.1.248,KING RICHARD II,"Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:"
80632,80633,Richard II,47.0,4.1.249,KING RICHARD II,And yet salt water blinds them not so much
80633,80634,Richard II,47.0,4.1.250,KING RICHARD II,But they can see a sort of traitors here.
80634,80635,Richard II,47.0,4.1.251,KING RICHARD II,"Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,"
80635,80636,Richard II,47.0,4.1.252,KING RICHARD II,"I find myself a traitor with the rest,"
80636,80637,Richard II,47.0,4.1.253,KING RICHARD II,For I have given here my soul's consent
80637,80638,Richard II,47.0,4.1.254,KING RICHARD II,"To undeck the pompous body of a king,"
80638,80639,Richard II,47.0,4.1.255,KING RICHARD II,"Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,"
80639,80640,Richard II,47.0,4.1.256,KING RICHARD II,"Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant."
80640,80641,Richard II,48.0,4.1.257,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord,--"
80641,80642,Richard II,49.0,4.1.258,KING RICHARD II,"No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,"
80642,80643,Richard II,49.0,4.1.259,KING RICHARD II,"Nor no man's lord, I have no name, no title,"
80643,80644,Richard II,49.0,4.1.260,KING RICHARD II,"No, not that name was given me at the font,"
80644,80645,Richard II,49.0,4.1.261,KING RICHARD II,"But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,"
80645,80646,Richard II,49.0,4.1.262,KING RICHARD II,"That I have worn so many winters out,"
80646,80647,Richard II,49.0,4.1.263,KING RICHARD II,And know not now what name to call myself!
80647,80648,Richard II,49.0,4.1.264,KING RICHARD II,"O that I were a mockery king of snow,"
80648,80649,Richard II,49.0,4.1.265,KING RICHARD II,"Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,"
80649,80650,Richard II,49.0,4.1.266,KING RICHARD II,To melt myself away in water-drops!
80650,80651,Richard II,49.0,4.1.267,KING RICHARD II,"Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,"
80651,80652,Richard II,49.0,4.1.268,KING RICHARD II,"An if my word be sterling yet in England,"
80652,80653,Richard II,49.0,4.1.269,KING RICHARD II,"Let it command a mirror hither straight,"
80653,80654,Richard II,49.0,4.1.270,KING RICHARD II,"That it may show me what a face I have,"
80654,80655,Richard II,49.0,4.1.271,KING RICHARD II,Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.
80655,80656,Richard II,50.0,4.1.272,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
80656,80657,Richard II,50.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Exit an attendant
80657,80658,Richard II,51.0,4.1.273,NORTHUMBERLAND,Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
80658,80659,Richard II,52.0,4.1.274,KING RICHARD II,"Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!"
80659,80660,Richard II,53.0,4.1.275,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland."
80660,80661,Richard II,54.0,4.1.276,NORTHUMBERLAND,The commons will not then be satisfied.
80661,80662,Richard II,55.0,4.1.277,KING RICHARD II,"They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,"
80662,80663,Richard II,55.0,4.1.278,KING RICHARD II,When I do see the very book indeed
80663,80664,Richard II,55.0,4.1.279,KING RICHARD II,"Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself."
80664,80665,Richard II,55.0,,KING RICHARD II,"Re-enter Attendant, with a glass"
80665,80666,Richard II,55.0,4.1.280,KING RICHARD II,"Give me the glass, and therein will I read."
80666,80667,Richard II,55.0,4.1.281,KING RICHARD II,No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
80667,80668,Richard II,55.0,4.1.282,KING RICHARD II,"So many blows upon this face of mine,"
80668,80669,Richard II,55.0,4.1.283,KING RICHARD II,"And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,"
80669,80670,Richard II,55.0,4.1.284,KING RICHARD II,"Like to my followers in prosperity,"
80670,80671,Richard II,55.0,4.1.285,KING RICHARD II,Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
80671,80672,Richard II,55.0,4.1.286,KING RICHARD II,That every day under his household roof
80672,80673,Richard II,55.0,4.1.287,KING RICHARD II,Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
80673,80674,Richard II,55.0,4.1.288,KING RICHARD II,"That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?"
80674,80675,Richard II,55.0,4.1.289,KING RICHARD II,"Was this the face that faced so many follies,"
80675,80676,Richard II,55.0,4.1.290,KING RICHARD II,And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
80676,80677,Richard II,55.0,4.1.291,KING RICHARD II,A brittle glory shineth in this face:
80677,80678,Richard II,55.0,4.1.292,KING RICHARD II,"As brittle as the glory is the face,"
80678,80679,Richard II,55.0,,KING RICHARD II,Dashes the glass against the ground
80679,80680,Richard II,55.0,4.1.293,KING RICHARD II,"For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers."
80680,80681,Richard II,55.0,4.1.294,KING RICHARD II,"Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,"
80681,80682,Richard II,55.0,4.1.295,KING RICHARD II,How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
80682,80683,Richard II,56.0,4.1.296,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
80683,80684,Richard II,56.0,4.1.297,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,The shadow or your face.
80684,80685,Richard II,57.0,4.1.298,KING RICHARD II,Say that again.
80685,80686,Richard II,57.0,4.1.299,KING RICHARD II,The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
80686,80687,Richard II,57.0,4.1.300,KING RICHARD II,"'Tis very true, my grief lies all within,"
80687,80688,Richard II,57.0,4.1.301,KING RICHARD II,And these external manners of laments
80688,80689,Richard II,57.0,4.1.302,KING RICHARD II,Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
80689,80690,Richard II,57.0,4.1.303,KING RICHARD II,"That swells with silence in the tortured soul,"
80690,80691,Richard II,57.0,4.1.304,KING RICHARD II,"There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,"
80691,80692,Richard II,57.0,4.1.305,KING RICHARD II,"For thy great bounty, that not only givest"
80692,80693,Richard II,57.0,4.1.306,KING RICHARD II,Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
80693,80694,Richard II,57.0,4.1.307,KING RICHARD II,"How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,"
80694,80695,Richard II,57.0,4.1.308,KING RICHARD II,And then be gone and trouble you no more.
80695,80696,Richard II,57.0,4.1.309,KING RICHARD II,Shall I obtain it?
80696,80697,Richard II,58.0,4.1.310,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Name it, fair cousin."
80697,80698,Richard II,59.0,4.1.311,KING RICHARD II,'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
80698,80699,Richard II,59.0,4.1.312,KING RICHARD II,"For when I was a king, my flatterers"
80699,80700,Richard II,59.0,4.1.313,KING RICHARD II,"Were then but subjects, being now a subject,"
80700,80701,Richard II,59.0,4.1.314,KING RICHARD II,I have a king here to my flatterer.
80701,80702,Richard II,59.0,4.1.315,KING RICHARD II,"Being so great, I have no need to beg."
80702,80703,Richard II,60.0,4.1.316,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Yet ask.
80703,80704,Richard II,61.0,4.1.317,KING RICHARD II,And shall I have?
80704,80705,Richard II,62.0,4.1.318,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,You shall.
80705,80706,Richard II,63.0,4.1.319,KING RICHARD II,Then give me leave to go.
80706,80707,Richard II,64.0,4.1.320,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Whither?
80707,80708,Richard II,65.0,4.1.321,KING RICHARD II,"Whither you will, so I were from your sights."
80708,80709,Richard II,66.0,4.1.322,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Go, some of you convey him to the Tower."
80709,80710,Richard II,67.0,4.1.323,KING RICHARD II,"O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,"
80710,80711,Richard II,67.0,4.1.324,KING RICHARD II,That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
80711,80712,Richard II,67.0,,KING RICHARD II,"Exeunt KING RICHARD II, some Lords, and a Guard"
80712,80713,Richard II,68.0,4.1.325,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
80713,80714,Richard II,68.0,4.1.326,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves."
80714,80715,Richard II,68.0,,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot of Westminster, and DUKE OF AUMERLE"
80715,80716,Richard II,69.0,4.1.327,Abbot,A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
80716,80717,Richard II,70.0,4.1.328,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,"The woe's to come, the children yet unborn."
80717,80718,Richard II,70.0,4.1.329,BISHOP OF CARLISLE,Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
80718,80719,Richard II,71.0,4.1.330,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"You holy clergymen, is there no plot"
80719,80720,Richard II,71.0,4.1.331,DUKE OF AUMERLE,To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
80720,80721,Richard II,72.0,4.1.332,Abbot,"My lord,"
80721,80722,Richard II,72.0,4.1.333,Abbot,"Before I freely speak my mind herein,"
80722,80723,Richard II,72.0,4.1.334,Abbot,You shall not only take the sacrament
80723,80724,Richard II,72.0,4.1.335,Abbot,"To bury mine intents, but also to effect"
80724,80725,Richard II,72.0,4.1.336,Abbot,Whatever I shall happen to devise.
80725,80726,Richard II,72.0,4.1.337,Abbot,"I see your brows are full of discontent,"
80726,80727,Richard II,72.0,4.1.338,Abbot,Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
80727,80728,Richard II,72.0,4.1.339,Abbot,"Come home with me to supper, and I'll lay"
80728,80729,Richard II,72.0,4.1.340,Abbot,A plot shall show us all a merry day.

80731,80732,Richard II,72.0,,Abbot,SCENE I. London. A street leading to the Tower.
80732,80733,Richard II,72.0,,Abbot,Enter QUEEN and Ladies
80733,80734,Richard II,1.0,5.1.1,QUEEN,"This way the king will come, this is the way"
80734,80735,Richard II,1.0,5.1.2,QUEEN,"To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,"
80735,80736,Richard II,1.0,5.1.3,QUEEN,To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
80736,80737,Richard II,1.0,5.1.4,QUEEN,Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
80737,80738,Richard II,1.0,5.1.5,QUEEN,"Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth"
80738,80739,Richard II,1.0,5.1.6,QUEEN,Have any resting for her true king's queen.
80739,80740,Richard II,1.0,,QUEEN,Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard
80740,80741,Richard II,1.0,5.1.7,QUEEN,"But soft, but see, or rather do not see,"
80741,80742,Richard II,1.0,5.1.8,QUEEN,"My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,"
80742,80743,Richard II,1.0,5.1.9,QUEEN,"That you in pity may dissolve to dew,"
80743,80744,Richard II,1.0,5.1.10,QUEEN,And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
80744,80745,Richard II,1.0,5.1.11,QUEEN,"Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,"
80745,80746,Richard II,1.0,5.1.12,QUEEN,"Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,"
80746,80747,Richard II,1.0,5.1.13,QUEEN,"And not King Richard, thou most beauteous inn,"
80747,80748,Richard II,1.0,5.1.14,QUEEN,"Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,"
80748,80749,Richard II,1.0,5.1.15,QUEEN,When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
80749,80750,Richard II,2.0,5.1.16,KING RICHARD II,"Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,"
80750,80751,Richard II,2.0,5.1.17,KING RICHARD II,"To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,"
80751,80752,Richard II,2.0,5.1.18,KING RICHARD II,"To think our former state a happy dream,"
80752,80753,Richard II,2.0,5.1.19,KING RICHARD II,"From which awaked, the truth of what we are"
80753,80754,Richard II,2.0,5.1.20,KING RICHARD II,"Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,"
80754,80755,Richard II,2.0,5.1.21,KING RICHARD II,"To grim Necessity, and he and I"
80755,80756,Richard II,2.0,5.1.22,KING RICHARD II,Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
80756,80757,Richard II,2.0,5.1.23,KING RICHARD II,And cloister thee in some religious house:
80757,80758,Richard II,2.0,5.1.24,KING RICHARD II,"Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,"
80758,80759,Richard II,2.0,5.1.25,KING RICHARD II,Which our profane hours here have stricken down.
80759,80760,Richard II,3.0,5.1.26,QUEEN,"What, is my Richard both in shape and mind"
80760,80761,Richard II,3.0,5.1.27,QUEEN,Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
80761,80762,Richard II,3.0,5.1.28,QUEEN,Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
80762,80763,Richard II,3.0,5.1.29,QUEEN,"The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,"
80763,80764,Richard II,3.0,5.1.30,QUEEN,"And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage"
80764,80765,Richard II,3.0,5.1.31,QUEEN,"To be o'erpower'd, and wilt thou, pupil-like,"
80765,80766,Richard II,3.0,5.1.32,QUEEN,"Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,"
80766,80767,Richard II,3.0,5.1.33,QUEEN,"And fawn on rage with base humility,"
80767,80768,Richard II,3.0,5.1.34,QUEEN,Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
80768,80769,Richard II,4.0,5.1.35,KING RICHARD II,"A king of beasts, indeed, if aught but beasts,"
80769,80770,Richard II,4.0,5.1.36,KING RICHARD II,I had been still a happy king of men.
80770,80771,Richard II,4.0,5.1.37,KING RICHARD II,"Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:"
80771,80772,Richard II,4.0,5.1.38,KING RICHARD II,"Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,"
80772,80773,Richard II,4.0,5.1.39,KING RICHARD II,"As from my death-bed, thy last living leave."
80773,80774,Richard II,4.0,5.1.40,KING RICHARD II,In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
80774,80775,Richard II,4.0,5.1.41,KING RICHARD II,With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
80775,80776,Richard II,4.0,5.1.42,KING RICHARD II,"Of woeful ages long ago betid,"
80776,80777,Richard II,4.0,5.1.43,KING RICHARD II,"And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,"
80777,80778,Richard II,4.0,5.1.44,KING RICHARD II,Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
80778,80779,Richard II,4.0,5.1.45,KING RICHARD II,And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
80779,80780,Richard II,4.0,5.1.46,KING RICHARD II,"For why, the senseless brands will sympathize"
80780,80781,Richard II,4.0,5.1.47,KING RICHARD II,The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
80781,80782,Richard II,4.0,5.1.48,KING RICHARD II,"And in compassion weep the fire out,"
80782,80783,Richard II,4.0,5.1.49,KING RICHARD II,"And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,"
80783,80784,Richard II,4.0,5.1.50,KING RICHARD II,For the deposing of a rightful king.
80784,80785,Richard II,4.0,,KING RICHARD II,Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others
80785,80786,Richard II,5.0,5.1.51,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:"
80786,80787,Richard II,5.0,5.1.52,NORTHUMBERLAND,"You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower."
80787,80788,Richard II,5.0,5.1.53,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And, madam, there is order ta'en for you,"
80788,80789,Richard II,5.0,5.1.54,NORTHUMBERLAND,With all swift speed you must away to France.
80789,80790,Richard II,6.0,5.1.55,KING RICHARD II,"Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal"
80790,80791,Richard II,6.0,5.1.56,KING RICHARD II,"The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,"
80791,80792,Richard II,6.0,5.1.57,KING RICHARD II,The time shall not be many hours of age
80792,80793,Richard II,6.0,5.1.58,KING RICHARD II,More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
80793,80794,Richard II,6.0,5.1.59,KING RICHARD II,"Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,"
80794,80795,Richard II,6.0,5.1.60,KING RICHARD II,"Though he divide the realm and give thee half,"
80795,80796,Richard II,6.0,5.1.61,KING RICHARD II,"It is too little, helping him to all,"
80796,80797,Richard II,6.0,5.1.62,KING RICHARD II,"And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way"
80797,80798,Richard II,6.0,5.1.63,KING RICHARD II,"To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,"
80798,80799,Richard II,6.0,5.1.64,KING RICHARD II,"Being ne'er so little urged, another way"
80799,80800,Richard II,6.0,5.1.65,KING RICHARD II,To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
80800,80801,Richard II,6.0,5.1.66,KING RICHARD II,"The love of wicked men converts to fear,"
80801,80802,Richard II,6.0,5.1.67,KING RICHARD II,"That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both"
80802,80803,Richard II,6.0,5.1.68,KING RICHARD II,To worthy danger and deserved death.
80803,80804,Richard II,7.0,5.1.69,NORTHUMBERLAND,"My guilt be on my head, and there an end."
80804,80805,Richard II,7.0,5.1.70,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Take leave and part, for you must part forthwith."
80805,80806,Richard II,8.0,5.1.71,KING RICHARD II,"Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate"
80806,80807,Richard II,8.0,5.1.72,KING RICHARD II,"A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,"
80807,80808,Richard II,8.0,5.1.73,KING RICHARD II,And then betwixt me and my married wife.
80808,80809,Richard II,8.0,5.1.74,KING RICHARD II,"Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me,"
80809,80810,Richard II,8.0,5.1.75,KING RICHARD II,"And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made."
80810,80811,Richard II,8.0,5.1.76,KING RICHARD II,"Part us, Northumberland, I toward the north,"
80811,80812,Richard II,8.0,5.1.77,KING RICHARD II,"Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime,"
80812,80813,Richard II,8.0,5.1.78,KING RICHARD II,"My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,"
80813,80814,Richard II,8.0,5.1.79,KING RICHARD II,"She came adorned hither like sweet May,"
80814,80815,Richard II,8.0,5.1.80,KING RICHARD II,Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.
80815,80816,Richard II,9.0,5.1.81,QUEEN,And must we be divided? must we part?
80816,80817,Richard II,10.0,5.1.82,KING RICHARD II,"Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart."
80817,80818,Richard II,11.0,5.1.83,QUEEN,Banish us both and send the king with me.
80818,80819,Richard II,12.0,5.1.84,NORTHUMBERLAND,That were some love but little policy.
80819,80820,Richard II,13.0,5.1.85,QUEEN,"Then whither he goes, thither let me go."
80820,80821,Richard II,14.0,5.1.86,KING RICHARD II,"So two, together weeping, make one woe."
80821,80822,Richard II,14.0,5.1.87,KING RICHARD II,"Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here,"
80822,80823,Richard II,14.0,5.1.88,KING RICHARD II,"Better far off than near, be ne'er the near."
80823,80824,Richard II,14.0,5.1.89,KING RICHARD II,"Go, count thy way with sighs, I mine with groans."
80824,80825,Richard II,15.0,5.1.90,QUEEN,So longest way shall have the longest moans.
80825,80826,Richard II,16.0,5.1.91,KING RICHARD II,"Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,"
80826,80827,Richard II,16.0,5.1.92,KING RICHARD II,And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
80827,80828,Richard II,16.0,5.1.93,KING RICHARD II,"Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,"
80828,80829,Richard II,16.0,5.1.94,KING RICHARD II,"Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief,"
80829,80830,Richard II,16.0,5.1.95,KING RICHARD II,"One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part,"
80830,80831,Richard II,16.0,5.1.96,KING RICHARD II,"Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart."
80831,80832,Richard II,17.0,5.1.97,QUEEN,"Give me mine own again, 'twere no good part"
80832,80833,Richard II,17.0,5.1.98,QUEEN,To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
80833,80834,Richard II,17.0,5.1.99,QUEEN,"So, now I have mine own again, be gone,"
80834,80835,Richard II,17.0,5.1.100,QUEEN,That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
80835,80836,Richard II,18.0,5.1.101,KING RICHARD II,We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
80836,80837,Richard II,18.0,5.1.102,KING RICHARD II,"Once more, adieu, the rest let sorrow say."
80837,80838,Richard II,18.0,,KING RICHARD II,Exeunt

80840,80841,Richard II,1.0,5.2.1,DUCHESS OF YORK,"My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,"
80841,80842,Richard II,1.0,5.2.2,DUCHESS OF YORK,"When weeping made you break the story off,"
80842,80843,Richard II,1.0,5.2.3,DUCHESS OF YORK,of our two cousins coming into London.
80843,80844,Richard II,2.0,5.2.4,DUKE OF YORK,Where did I leave?
80844,80845,Richard II,3.0,5.2.5,DUCHESS OF YORK,"At that sad stop, my lord,"
80845,80846,Richard II,3.0,5.2.6,DUCHESS OF YORK,Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
80846,80847,Richard II,3.0,5.2.7,DUCHESS OF YORK,Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
80847,80848,Richard II,4.0,5.2.8,DUKE OF YORK,"Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,"
80848,80849,Richard II,4.0,5.2.9,DUKE OF YORK,Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
80849,80850,Richard II,4.0,5.2.10,DUKE OF YORK,"Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,"
80850,80851,Richard II,4.0,5.2.11,DUKE OF YORK,"With slow but stately pace kept on his course,"
80851,80852,Richard II,4.0,5.2.12,DUKE OF YORK,"Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,"
80852,80853,Richard II,4.0,5.2.13,DUKE OF YORK,Bolingbroke!'
80853,80854,Richard II,4.0,5.2.14,DUKE OF YORK,"You would have thought the very windows spake,"
80854,80855,Richard II,4.0,5.2.15,DUKE OF YORK,So many greedy looks of young and old
80855,80856,Richard II,4.0,5.2.16,DUKE OF YORK,Through casements darted their desiring eyes
80856,80857,Richard II,4.0,5.2.17,DUKE OF YORK,"Upon his visage, and that all the walls"
80857,80858,Richard II,4.0,5.2.18,DUKE OF YORK,With painted imagery had said at once
80858,80859,Richard II,4.0,5.2.19,DUKE OF YORK,"'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'"
80859,80860,Richard II,4.0,5.2.20,DUKE OF YORK,"Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,"
80860,80861,Richard II,4.0,5.2.21,DUKE OF YORK,"Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,"
80861,80862,Richard II,4.0,5.2.22,DUKE OF YORK,"Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'"
80862,80863,Richard II,4.0,5.2.23,DUKE OF YORK,"And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along."
80863,80864,Richard II,5.0,5.2.24,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?"
80864,80865,Richard II,6.0,5.2.25,DUKE OF YORK,"As in a theatre, the eyes of men,"
80865,80866,Richard II,6.0,5.2.26,DUKE OF YORK,"After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,"
80866,80867,Richard II,6.0,5.2.27,DUKE OF YORK,"Are idly bent on him that enters next,"
80867,80868,Richard II,6.0,5.2.28,DUKE OF YORK,"Thinking his prattle to be tedious,"
80868,80869,Richard II,6.0,5.2.29,DUKE OF YORK,"Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes"
80869,80870,Richard II,6.0,5.2.30,DUKE OF YORK,"Did scowl on gentle Richard, no man cried 'God save him!'"
80870,80871,Richard II,6.0,5.2.31,DUKE OF YORK,No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
80871,80872,Richard II,6.0,5.2.32,DUKE OF YORK,But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
80872,80873,Richard II,6.0,5.2.33,DUKE OF YORK,"Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,"
80873,80874,Richard II,6.0,5.2.34,DUKE OF YORK,"His face still combating with tears and smiles,"
80874,80875,Richard II,6.0,5.2.35,DUKE OF YORK,"The badges of his grief and patience,"
80875,80876,Richard II,6.0,5.2.36,DUKE OF YORK,"That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd"
80876,80877,Richard II,6.0,5.2.37,DUKE OF YORK,"The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted"
80877,80878,Richard II,6.0,5.2.38,DUKE OF YORK,And barbarism itself have pitied him.
80878,80879,Richard II,6.0,5.2.39,DUKE OF YORK,"But heaven hath a hand in these events,"
80879,80880,Richard II,6.0,5.2.40,DUKE OF YORK,To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
80880,80881,Richard II,6.0,5.2.41,DUKE OF YORK,"To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,"
80881,80882,Richard II,6.0,5.2.42,DUKE OF YORK,Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
80882,80883,Richard II,7.0,5.2.43,DUCHESS OF YORK,Here comes my son Aumerle.
80883,80884,Richard II,8.0,5.2.44,DUKE OF YORK,"Aumerle that was,"
80884,80885,Richard II,8.0,5.2.45,DUKE OF YORK,"But that is lost for being Richard's friend,"
80885,80886,Richard II,8.0,5.2.46,DUKE OF YORK,"And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:"
80886,80887,Richard II,8.0,5.2.47,DUKE OF YORK,I am in parliament pledge for his truth
80887,80888,Richard II,8.0,5.2.48,DUKE OF YORK,And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
80888,80889,Richard II,8.0,,DUKE OF YORK,Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE
80889,80890,Richard II,9.0,5.2.49,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Welcome, my son: who are the violets now"
80890,80891,Richard II,9.0,5.2.50,DUCHESS OF YORK,That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
80891,80892,Richard II,10.0,5.2.51,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:"
80892,80893,Richard II,10.0,5.2.52,DUKE OF AUMERLE,God knows I had as lief be none as one.
80893,80894,Richard II,11.0,5.2.53,DUKE OF YORK,"Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,"
80894,80895,Richard II,11.0,5.2.54,DUKE OF YORK,Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
80895,80896,Richard II,11.0,5.2.55,DUKE OF YORK,What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
80896,80897,Richard II,12.0,5.2.56,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"For aught I know, my lord, they do."
80897,80898,Richard II,13.0,5.2.57,DUKE OF YORK,"You will be there, I know."
80898,80899,Richard II,14.0,5.2.58,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"If God prevent not, I purpose so."
80899,80900,Richard II,15.0,5.2.59,DUKE OF YORK,"What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?"
80900,80901,Richard II,15.0,5.2.60,DUKE OF YORK,"Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing."
80901,80902,Richard II,16.0,5.2.61,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"My lord, 'tis nothing."
80902,80903,Richard II,17.0,5.2.62,DUKE OF YORK,"No matter, then, who see it,"
80903,80904,Richard II,17.0,5.2.63,DUKE OF YORK,"I will be satisfied, let me see the writing."
80904,80905,Richard II,18.0,5.2.64,DUKE OF AUMERLE,I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
80905,80906,Richard II,18.0,5.2.65,DUKE OF AUMERLE,"It is a matter of small consequence,"

80961,80962,Richard II,40.0,5.2.118,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He is as like thee as a man may be,"
80962,80963,Richard II,40.0,5.2.119,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Not like to me, or any of my kin,"
80963,80964,Richard II,40.0,5.2.120,DUCHESS OF YORK,And yet I love him.

80981,80982,Richard II,1.0,5.3.6,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,"

80983,80984,Richard II,1.0,5.3.8,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,"

80992,80993,Richard II,4.0,5.3.17,HENRY PERCY,"And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,"
80993,80994,Richard II,4.0,5.3.18,HENRY PERCY,"And wear it as a favour, and with that"
80994,80995,Richard II,4.0,5.3.19,HENRY PERCY,He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.

81083,81084,Richard II,36.0,5.3.102,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face,"
81084,81085,Richard II,36.0,5.3.103,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest,"
81085,81086,Richard II,36.0,5.3.104,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:"
81086,81087,Richard II,36.0,5.3.105,DUCHESS OF YORK,"He prays but faintly and would be denied,"
81087,81088,Richard II,36.0,5.3.106,DUCHESS OF YORK,We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
81088,81089,Richard II,36.0,5.3.107,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His weary joints would gladly rise, I know,"
81089,81090,Richard II,36.0,5.3.108,DUCHESS OF YORK,Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
81090,81091,Richard II,36.0,5.3.109,DUCHESS OF YORK,"His prayers are full of false hypocrisy,"
81091,81092,Richard II,36.0,5.3.110,DUCHESS OF YORK,Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
81092,81093,Richard II,36.0,5.3.111,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Our prayers do out-pray his, then let them have"
81093,81094,Richard II,36.0,5.3.112,DUCHESS OF YORK,That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
81094,81095,Richard II,37.0,5.3.113,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good aunt, stand up."
81095,81096,Richard II,38.0,5.3.114,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Nay, do not say, 'stand up,'"
81096,81097,Richard II,38.0,5.3.115,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'"
81097,81098,Richard II,38.0,5.3.116,DUCHESS OF YORK,"And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,"
81098,81099,Richard II,38.0,5.3.117,DUCHESS OF YORK,'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
81099,81100,Richard II,38.0,5.3.118,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I never long'd to hear a word till now,"
81100,81101,Richard II,38.0,5.3.119,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Say 'pardon,' king, let pity teach thee how:"
81101,81102,Richard II,38.0,5.3.120,DUCHESS OF YORK,"The word is short, but not so short as sweet,"
81102,81103,Richard II,38.0,5.3.121,DUCHESS OF YORK,No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
81103,81104,Richard II,39.0,5.3.122,DUKE OF YORK,"Speak it in French, king, say, 'pardonne moi.'"
81104,81105,Richard II,40.0,5.3.123,DUCHESS OF YORK,Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
81105,81106,Richard II,40.0,5.3.124,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,"
81106,81107,Richard II,40.0,5.3.125,DUCHESS OF YORK,That set'st the word itself against the word!
81107,81108,Richard II,40.0,5.3.126,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land,"
81108,81109,Richard II,40.0,5.3.127,DUCHESS OF YORK,The chopping French we do not understand.
81109,81110,Richard II,40.0,5.3.128,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Thine eye begins to speak, set thy tongue there,"
81110,81111,Richard II,40.0,5.3.129,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear,"
81111,81112,Richard II,40.0,5.3.130,DUCHESS OF YORK,"That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,"
81112,81113,Richard II,40.0,5.3.131,DUCHESS OF YORK,Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
81113,81114,Richard II,41.0,5.3.132,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good aunt, stand up."
81114,81115,Richard II,42.0,5.3.133,DUCHESS OF YORK,"I do not sue to stand,"
81115,81116,Richard II,42.0,5.3.134,DUCHESS OF YORK,Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
81116,81117,Richard II,43.0,5.3.135,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"I pardon him, as God shall pardon me."
81117,81118,Richard II,44.0,5.3.136,DUCHESS OF YORK,O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
81118,81119,Richard II,44.0,5.3.137,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again,"
81119,81120,Richard II,44.0,5.3.138,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,"
81120,81121,Richard II,44.0,5.3.139,DUCHESS OF YORK,But makes one pardon strong.
81121,81122,Richard II,45.0,5.3.140,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,With all my heart
81122,81123,Richard II,45.0,5.3.141,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,I pardon him.
81123,81124,Richard II,46.0,5.3.142,DUCHESS OF YORK,A god on earth thou art.
81124,81125,Richard II,47.0,5.3.143,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,"
81125,81126,Richard II,47.0,5.3.144,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"With all the rest of that consorted crew,"
81126,81127,Richard II,47.0,5.3.145,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
81127,81128,Richard II,47.0,5.3.146,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Good uncle, help to order several powers"
81128,81129,Richard II,47.0,5.3.147,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:"
81129,81130,Richard II,47.0,5.3.148,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"They shall not live within this world, I swear,"
81130,81131,Richard II,47.0,5.3.149,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"But I will have them, if I once know where."
81131,81132,Richard II,47.0,5.3.150,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:"
81132,81133,Richard II,47.0,5.3.151,HENRY BOLINGBROKE,"Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true."
81133,81134,Richard II,48.0,5.3.152,DUCHESS OF YORK,"Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new."

81136,81137,Richard II,48.0,,DUCHESS OF YORK,Enter EXTON and Servant
81137,81138,Richard II,1.0,5.4.1,EXTON,"Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,"
81138,81139,Richard II,1.0,5.4.2,EXTON,'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
81139,81140,Richard II,1.0,5.4.3,EXTON,Was it not so?
81140,81141,Richard II,2.0,5.4.4,Servant,These were his very words.
81141,81142,Richard II,3.0,5.4.5,EXTON,"'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,"
81142,81143,Richard II,3.0,5.4.6,EXTON,"And urged it twice together, did he not?"
81143,81144,Richard II,4.0,5.4.7,Servant,He did.
81144,81145,Richard II,5.0,5.4.8,EXTON,"And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,"
81145,81146,Richard II,5.0,5.4.9,EXTON,"And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'"
81146,81147,Richard II,5.0,5.4.10,EXTON,"That would divorce this terror from my heart,'"
81147,81148,Richard II,5.0,5.4.11,EXTON,"Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:"
81148,81149,Richard II,5.0,5.4.12,EXTON,"I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe."
81149,81150,Richard II,5.0,,EXTON,Exeunt
81150,81151,Richard II,5.0,,EXTON,SCENE V. Pomfret castle.
81151,81152,Richard II,5.0,,EXTON,Enter KING RICHARD
81152,81153,Richard II,1.0,5.5.1,KING RICHARD II,I have been studying how I may compare
81153,81154,Richard II,1.0,5.5.2,KING RICHARD II,This prison where I live unto the world:
81154,81155,Richard II,1.0,5.5.3,KING RICHARD II,And for because the world is populous
81155,81156,Richard II,1.0,5.5.4,KING RICHARD II,"And here is not a creature but myself,"
81156,81157,Richard II,1.0,5.5.5,KING RICHARD II,"I cannot do it, yet I'll hammer it out."
81157,81158,Richard II,1.0,5.5.6,KING RICHARD II,"My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,"
81158,81159,Richard II,1.0,5.5.7,KING RICHARD II,"My soul the father, and these two beget"
81159,81160,Richard II,1.0,5.5.8,KING RICHARD II,"A generation of still-breeding thoughts,"
81160,81161,Richard II,1.0,5.5.9,KING RICHARD II,"And these same thoughts people this little world,"
81161,81162,Richard II,1.0,5.5.10,KING RICHARD II,"In humours like the people of this world,"
81162,81163,Richard II,1.0,5.5.11,KING RICHARD II,"For no thought is contented. The better sort,"
81163,81164,Richard II,1.0,5.5.12,KING RICHARD II,"As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd"
81164,81165,Richard II,1.0,5.5.13,KING RICHARD II,With scruples and do set the word itself
81165,81166,Richard II,1.0,5.5.14,KING RICHARD II,Against the word:
81166,81167,Richard II,1.0,5.5.15,KING RICHARD II,"As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,"
81167,81168,Richard II,1.0,5.5.16,KING RICHARD II,'It is as hard to come as for a camel
81168,81169,Richard II,1.0,5.5.17,KING RICHARD II,To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
81169,81170,Richard II,1.0,5.5.18,KING RICHARD II,"Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot"
81170,81171,Richard II,1.0,5.5.19,KING RICHARD II,"Unlikely wonders, how these vain weak nails"
81171,81172,Richard II,1.0,5.5.20,KING RICHARD II,May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
81172,81173,Richard II,1.0,5.5.21,KING RICHARD II,"Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,"
81173,81174,Richard II,1.0,5.5.22,KING RICHARD II,"And, for they cannot, die in their own pride."
81174,81175,Richard II,1.0,5.5.23,KING RICHARD II,Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
81175,81176,Richard II,1.0,5.5.24,KING RICHARD II,"That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,"
81176,81177,Richard II,1.0,5.5.25,KING RICHARD II,"Nor shall not be the last, like silly beggars"
81177,81178,Richard II,1.0,5.5.26,KING RICHARD II,"Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,"
81178,81179,Richard II,1.0,5.5.27,KING RICHARD II,"That many have and others must sit there,"
81179,81180,Richard II,1.0,5.5.28,KING RICHARD II,"And in this thought they find a kind of ease,"
81180,81181,Richard II,1.0,5.5.29,KING RICHARD II,Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
81181,81182,Richard II,1.0,5.5.30,KING RICHARD II,Of such as have before endured the like.
81182,81183,Richard II,1.0,5.5.31,KING RICHARD II,"Thus play I in one person many people,"
81183,81184,Richard II,1.0,5.5.32,KING RICHARD II,"And none contented: sometimes am I king,"
81184,81185,Richard II,1.0,5.5.33,KING RICHARD II,"Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,"
81185,81186,Richard II,1.0,5.5.34,KING RICHARD II,And so I am: then crushing penury
81186,81187,Richard II,1.0,5.5.35,KING RICHARD II,"Persuades me I was better when a king,"
81187,81188,Richard II,1.0,5.5.36,KING RICHARD II,Then am I king'd again: and by and by
81188,81189,Richard II,1.0,5.5.37,KING RICHARD II,"Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,"
81189,81190,Richard II,1.0,5.5.38,KING RICHARD II,"And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,"
81190,81191,Richard II,1.0,5.5.39,KING RICHARD II,Nor I nor any man that but man is
81191,81192,Richard II,1.0,5.5.40,KING RICHARD II,"With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased"
81192,81193,Richard II,1.0,5.5.41,KING RICHARD II,With being nothing. Music do I hear?
81193,81194,Richard II,1.0,,KING RICHARD II,Music
81194,81195,Richard II,1.0,5.5.42,KING RICHARD II,"Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,"
81195,81196,Richard II,1.0,5.5.43,KING RICHARD II,When time is broke and no proportion kept!
81196,81197,Richard II,1.0,5.5.44,KING RICHARD II,So is it in the music of men's lives.
81197,81198,Richard II,1.0,5.5.45,KING RICHARD II,And here have I the daintiness of ear
81198,81199,Richard II,1.0,5.5.46,KING RICHARD II,"To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string,"
81199,81200,Richard II,1.0,5.5.47,KING RICHARD II,But for the concord of my state and time
81200,81201,Richard II,1.0,5.5.48,KING RICHARD II,Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
81201,81202,Richard II,1.0,5.5.49,KING RICHARD II,"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me,"
81202,81203,Richard II,1.0,5.5.50,KING RICHARD II,For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
81203,81204,Richard II,1.0,5.5.51,KING RICHARD II,"My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar"
81204,81205,Richard II,1.0,5.5.52,KING RICHARD II,"Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,"
81205,81206,Richard II,1.0,5.5.53,KING RICHARD II,"Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,"
81206,81207,Richard II,1.0,5.5.54,KING RICHARD II,"Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears."
81207,81208,Richard II,1.0,5.5.55,KING RICHARD II,"Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is"
81208,81209,Richard II,1.0,5.5.56,KING RICHARD II,"Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,"
81209,81210,Richard II,1.0,5.5.57,KING RICHARD II,Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
81210,81211,Richard II,1.0,5.5.58,KING RICHARD II,"Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time"
81211,81212,Richard II,1.0,5.5.59,KING RICHARD II,"Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,"
81212,81213,Richard II,1.0,5.5.60,KING RICHARD II,"While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock."
81213,81214,Richard II,1.0,5.5.61,KING RICHARD II,"This music mads me, let it sound no more,"
81214,81215,Richard II,1.0,5.5.62,KING RICHARD II,"For though it have holp madmen to their wits,"
81215,81216,Richard II,1.0,5.5.63,KING RICHARD II,In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
81216,81217,Richard II,1.0,5.5.64,KING RICHARD II,Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
81217,81218,Richard II,1.0,5.5.65,KING RICHARD II,"For 'tis a sign of love, and love to Richard"
81218,81219,Richard II,1.0,5.5.66,KING RICHARD II,Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
81219,81220,Richard II,1.0,,KING RICHARD II,Enter a Groom of the Stable
81220,81221,Richard II,2.0,5.5.67,Groom,"Hail, royal prince!"
81221,81222,Richard II,3.0,5.5.68,KING RICHARD II,"Thanks, noble peer,"
81222,81223,Richard II,3.0,5.5.69,KING RICHARD II,The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
81223,81224,Richard II,3.0,5.5.70,KING RICHARD II,"What art thou? and how comest thou hither,"
81224,81225,Richard II,3.0,5.5.71,KING RICHARD II,Where no man never comes but that sad dog
81225,81226,Richard II,3.0,5.5.72,KING RICHARD II,That brings me food to make misfortune live?
81226,81227,Richard II,4.0,5.5.73,Groom,"I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,"
81227,81228,Richard II,4.0,5.5.74,Groom,"When thou wert king, who, travelling towards York,"
81228,81229,Richard II,4.0,5.5.75,Groom,With much ado at length have gotten leave
81229,81230,Richard II,4.0,5.5.76,Groom,To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
81230,81231,Richard II,4.0,5.5.77,Groom,"O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld"
81231,81232,Richard II,4.0,5.5.78,Groom,"In London streets, that coronation-day,"
81232,81233,Richard II,4.0,5.5.79,Groom,"When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,"
81233,81234,Richard II,4.0,5.5.80,Groom,"That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,"
81234,81235,Richard II,4.0,5.5.81,Groom,That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
81235,81236,Richard II,5.0,5.5.82,KING RICHARD II,"Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,"
81236,81237,Richard II,5.0,5.5.83,KING RICHARD II,How went he under him?
81237,81238,Richard II,6.0,5.5.84,Groom,So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
81238,81239,Richard II,7.0,5.5.85,KING RICHARD II,So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
81239,81240,Richard II,7.0,5.5.86,KING RICHARD II,"That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand,"
81240,81241,Richard II,7.0,5.5.87,KING RICHARD II,This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
81241,81242,Richard II,7.0,5.5.88,KING RICHARD II,"Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,"
81242,81243,Richard II,7.0,5.5.89,KING RICHARD II,"Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck"
81243,81244,Richard II,7.0,5.5.90,KING RICHARD II,Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
81244,81245,Richard II,7.0,5.5.91,KING RICHARD II,"Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,"
81245,81246,Richard II,7.0,5.5.92,KING RICHARD II,"Since thou, created to be awed by man,"
81246,81247,Richard II,7.0,5.5.93,KING RICHARD II,"Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse,"
81247,81248,Richard II,7.0,5.5.94,KING RICHARD II,"And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,"
81248,81249,Richard II,7.0,5.5.95,KING RICHARD II,"Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke."
81249,81250,Richard II,7.0,,KING RICHARD II,"Enter Keeper, with a dish"
81250,81251,Richard II,8.0,5.5.96,Keeper,"Fellow, give place, here is no longer stay."
81251,81252,Richard II,9.0,5.5.97,KING RICHARD II,"If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away."
81252,81253,Richard II,10.0,5.5.98,Groom,"What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say."
81253,81254,Richard II,10.0,,Groom,Exit
81254,81255,Richard II,11.0,5.5.99,Keeper,"My lord, will't please you to fall to?"
81255,81256,Richard II,12.0,5.5.100,KING RICHARD II,"Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do."
81256,81257,Richard II,13.0,5.5.101,Keeper,"My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who"
81257,81258,Richard II,13.0,5.5.102,Keeper,"lately came from the king, commands the contrary."
81258,81259,Richard II,14.0,5.5.103,KING RICHARD II,The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
81259,81260,Richard II,14.0,5.5.104,KING RICHARD II,"Patience is stale, and I am weary of it."
81260,81261,Richard II,14.0,,KING RICHARD II,Beats the keeper

81263,81264,Richard II,16.0,5.5.106,KING RICHARD II,How now! what means death in this rude assault?

75803,75804,Pericles,178.0,1.0.38,LODOVICO,"His riddle told not, lost his life:"
75804,75805,Pericles,178.0,1.0.39,LODOVICO,"So for her many a wight did die,"
75805,75806,Pericles,178.0,1.0.40,LODOVICO,As yon grim looks do testify.

75851,75852,Pericles,7.0,1.1.40,ANTIOCHUS,"For going on death's net, whom none resist."
75852,75853,Pericles,8.0,1.1.41,PERICLES,"Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught"

75862,75863,Pericles,8.0,1.1.51,PERICLES,"And all good men, as every prince should do,"
75863,75864,Pericles,8.0,1.1.52,PERICLES,"My riches to the earth from whence they came,"
75864,75865,Pericles,8.0,1.1.53,PERICLES,But my unspotted fire of love to you.

75868,75869,Pericles,9.0,1.1.56,ANTIOCHUS,"Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:"
75869,75870,Pericles,9.0,1.1.57,ANTIOCHUS,"Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,"
75870,75871,Pericles,9.0,1.1.58,ANTIOCHUS,As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
75871,75872,Pericles,10.0,1.1.59,Daughter,"Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!"
75872,75873,Pericles,10.0,1.1.60,Daughter,"Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!"

75880,75881,Pericles,11.0,1.1.67,PERICLES,I found that kindness in a father:
75881,75882,Pericles,11.0,1.1.68,PERICLES,"He's father, son, and husband mild,"
75882,75883,Pericles,11.0,1.1.69,PERICLES,"I mother, wife, and yet his child."
75883,75884,Pericles,11.0,1.1.70,PERICLES,"How they may be, and yet in two,"
75884,75885,Pericles,11.0,1.1.71,PERICLES,"As you will live, resolve it you."
75885,75886,Pericles,11.0,1.1.72,PERICLES,"Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers"
75886,75887,Pericles,11.0,1.1.73,PERICLES,"That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,"
75887,75888,Pericles,11.0,1.1.74,PERICLES,"Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,"
75888,75889,Pericles,11.0,1.1.75,PERICLES,"If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?"
75889,75890,Pericles,11.0,1.1.76,PERICLES,"Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,"
75890,75891,Pericles,11.0,,PERICLES,Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS

75892,75893,Pericles,11.0,1.1.78,PERICLES,"But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt"
75893,75894,Pericles,11.0,1.1.79,PERICLES,For he's no man on whom perfections wait
75894,75895,Pericles,11.0,1.1.80,PERICLES,"That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate."
75895,75896,Pericles,11.0,1.1.81,PERICLES,"You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings,"

75899,75900,Pericles,11.0,1.1.85,PERICLES,Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
75900,75901,Pericles,11.0,1.1.86,PERICLES,"Good sooth, I care not for you."
75901,75902,Pericles,12.0,1.1.87,ANTIOCHUS,"Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life."
75902,75903,Pericles,12.0,1.1.88,ANTIOCHUS,"For that's an article within our law,"
75903,75904,Pericles,12.0,1.1.89,ANTIOCHUS,As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
75904,75905,Pericles,12.0,1.1.90,ANTIOCHUS,"Either expound now, or receive your sentence."
75905,75906,Pericles,13.0,1.1.91,PERICLES,"Great king,"
75906,75907,Pericles,13.0,1.1.92,PERICLES,"Few love to hear the sins they love to act,"

75909,75910,Pericles,13.0,1.1.95,PERICLES,He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
75910,75911,Pericles,13.0,1.1.96,PERICLES,For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.

75953,75954,Pericles,15.0,1.1.138,PERICLES,Will shun no course to keep them from the light.

75955,75956,Pericles,15.0,1.1.140,PERICLES,Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:

75958,75959,Pericles,15.0,1.1.143,PERICLES,"Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,"
75959,75960,Pericles,15.0,1.1.144,PERICLES,By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.

75963,75964,Pericles,16.0,1.1.146,ANTIOCHUS,To have his head.
75964,75965,Pericles,16.0,1.1.147,ANTIOCHUS,"He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,"
75965,75966,Pericles,16.0,1.1.148,ANTIOCHUS,Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
75966,75967,Pericles,16.0,1.1.149,ANTIOCHUS,"In such a loathed manner,"
75967,75968,Pericles,16.0,1.1.150,ANTIOCHUS,And therefore instantly this prince must die:
75968,75969,Pericles,16.0,1.1.151,ANTIOCHUS,For by his fall my honour must keep high.
75969,75970,Pericles,16.0,1.1.152,ANTIOCHUS,Who attends us there?
75970,75971,Pericles,16.0,,ANTIOCHUS,Enter THALIARD
75971,75972,Pericles,17.0,1.1.153,THALIARD,Doth your highness call?
75972,75973,Pericles,18.0,1.1.154,ANTIOCHUS,"Thaliard,"

75975,75976,Pericles,18.0,1.1.157,ANTIOCHUS,And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
75976,75977,Pericles,18.0,1.1.158,ANTIOCHUS,"Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold,"
75977,75978,Pericles,18.0,1.1.159,ANTIOCHUS,"We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:"
75978,75979,Pericles,18.0,1.1.160,ANTIOCHUS,"It fits thee not to ask the reason why,"
75979,75980,Pericles,18.0,1.1.161,ANTIOCHUS,"Because we bid it. Say, is it done?"
75980,75981,Pericles,19.0,1.1.162,THALIARD,"My lord,"

75982,75983,Pericles,20.0,1.1.164,ANTIOCHUS,Enough.
75983,75984,Pericles,20.0,,ANTIOCHUS,Enter a Messenger
75984,75985,Pericles,20.0,1.1.165,ANTIOCHUS,"Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste."
75985,75986,Pericles,21.0,1.1.166,Messenger,"My lord, prince Pericles is fled."

75988,75989,Pericles,22.0,1.1.168,ANTIOCHUS,"Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot"
75989,75990,Pericles,22.0,1.1.169,ANTIOCHUS,From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
75990,75991,Pericles,22.0,1.1.170,ANTIOCHUS,"His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return"

75993,75994,Pericles,23.0,1.1.173,THALIARD,"If I can get him within my pistol's length,"
75994,75995,Pericles,23.0,1.1.174,THALIARD,"I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness."
75995,75996,Pericles,24.0,1.1.175,ANTIOCHUS,"Thaliard, adieu!"
75996,75997,Pericles,24.0,,ANTIOCHUS,Exit THALIARD

75998,75999,Pericles,24.0,1.1.177,ANTIOCHUS,My heart can lend no succor to my head.

76000,76001,Pericles,24.0,,ANTIOCHUS,SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.
76001,76002,Pericles,24.0,,ANTIOCHUS,Enter PERICLES
76002,76003,Pericles,1.0,1.2.1,PERICLES,[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should
76003,76004,Pericles,1.0,1.2.2,PERICLES,"this change of thoughts,"
76004,76005,Pericles,1.0,1.2.3,PERICLES,"The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,"
76005,76006,Pericles,1.0,1.2.4,PERICLES,"Be my so used a guest as not an hour,"
76006,76007,Pericles,1.0,1.2.5,PERICLES,"In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,"
76007,76008,Pericles,1.0,1.2.6,PERICLES,"The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?"
76008,76009,Pericles,1.0,1.2.7,PERICLES,"Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,"
76009,76010,Pericles,1.0,1.2.8,PERICLES,"And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,"
76010,76011,Pericles,1.0,1.2.9,PERICLES,Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
76011,76012,Pericles,1.0,1.2.10,PERICLES,"Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,"
76012,76013,Pericles,1.0,1.2.11,PERICLES,Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
76013,76014,Pericles,1.0,1.2.12,PERICLES,"Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,"
76014,76015,Pericles,1.0,1.2.13,PERICLES,"That have their first conception by mis-dread,"
76015,76016,Pericles,1.0,1.2.14,PERICLES,"Have after-nourishment and life by care,"
76016,76017,Pericles,1.0,1.2.15,PERICLES,"And what was first but fear what might be done,"
76017,76018,Pericles,1.0,1.2.16,PERICLES,Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
76018,76019,Pericles,1.0,1.2.17,PERICLES,"And so with me: the great Antiochus,"
76019,76020,Pericles,1.0,1.2.18,PERICLES,"'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,"
76020,76021,Pericles,1.0,1.2.19,PERICLES,"Since he's so great can make his will his act,"
76021,76022,Pericles,1.0,1.2.20,PERICLES,"Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence,"
76022,76023,Pericles,1.0,1.2.21,PERICLES,Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
76023,76024,Pericles,1.0,1.2.22,PERICLES,If he suspect I may dishonour him:
76024,76025,Pericles,1.0,1.2.23,PERICLES,"And what may make him blush in being known,"
76025,76026,Pericles,1.0,1.2.24,PERICLES,"He'll stop the course by which it might be known,"
76026,76027,Pericles,1.0,1.2.25,PERICLES,"With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,"
76027,76028,Pericles,1.0,1.2.26,PERICLES,"And with the ostent of war will look so huge,"
76028,76029,Pericles,1.0,1.2.27,PERICLES,"Amazement shall drive courage from the state,"
76029,76030,Pericles,1.0,1.2.28,PERICLES,"Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,"
76030,76031,Pericles,1.0,1.2.29,PERICLES,And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
76031,76032,Pericles,1.0,1.2.30,PERICLES,"Which care of them, not pity of myself,"
76032,76033,Pericles,1.0,1.2.31,PERICLES,"Who am no more but as the tops of trees,"
76033,76034,Pericles,1.0,1.2.32,PERICLES,"Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,"
76034,76035,Pericles,1.0,1.2.33,PERICLES,"Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,"
76035,76036,Pericles,1.0,1.2.34,PERICLES,And punish that before that he would punish.
76036,76037,Pericles,1.0,,PERICLES,"Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords"
76037,76038,Pericles,2.0,1.2.35,First Lord,Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!
76038,76039,Pericles,3.0,1.2.36,Second Lord,"And keep your mind, till you return to us,"
76039,76040,Pericles,3.0,1.2.37,Second Lord,Peaceful and comfortable!
76040,76041,Pericles,4.0,1.2.38,HELICANUS,"Peace, peace, and give experience tongue."
76041,76042,Pericles,4.0,1.2.39,HELICANUS,They do abuse the king that flatter him:
76042,76043,Pericles,4.0,1.2.40,HELICANUS,"For flattery is the bellows blows up sin,"
76043,76044,Pericles,4.0,1.2.41,HELICANUS,"The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,"
76044,76045,Pericles,4.0,1.2.42,HELICANUS,"To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing,"
76045,76046,Pericles,4.0,1.2.43,HELICANUS,"Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,"
76046,76047,Pericles,4.0,1.2.44,HELICANUS,"Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err."
76047,76048,Pericles,4.0,1.2.45,HELICANUS,"When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,"
76048,76049,Pericles,4.0,1.2.46,HELICANUS,"He flatters you, makes war upon your life."
76049,76050,Pericles,4.0,1.2.47,HELICANUS,"Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please,"
76050,76051,Pericles,4.0,1.2.48,HELICANUS,I cannot be much lower than my knees.
76051,76052,Pericles,5.0,1.2.49,PERICLES,"All leave us else, but let your cares o'erlook"
76052,76053,Pericles,5.0,1.2.50,PERICLES,"What shipping and what lading's in our haven,"
76053,76054,Pericles,5.0,1.2.51,PERICLES,And then return to us.
76054,76055,Pericles,5.0,,PERICLES,Exeunt Lords
76055,76056,Pericles,5.0,1.2.52,PERICLES,"Helicanus, thou"
76056,76057,Pericles,5.0,1.2.53,PERICLES,Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?
76057,76058,Pericles,6.0,1.2.54,HELICANUS,"An angry brow, dread lord."
76058,76059,Pericles,7.0,1.2.55,PERICLES,"If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,"
76059,76060,Pericles,7.0,1.2.56,PERICLES,How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?
76060,76061,Pericles,8.0,1.2.57,HELICANUS,"How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence"
76061,76062,Pericles,8.0,1.2.58,HELICANUS,They have their nourishment?
76062,76063,Pericles,9.0,1.2.59,PERICLES,Thou know'st I have power
76063,76064,Pericles,9.0,1.2.60,PERICLES,To take thy life from thee.

76066,76067,Pericles,10.0,1.2.63,HELICANUS,Do you but strike the blow.
76067,76068,Pericles,11.0,1.2.64,PERICLES,"Rise, prithee, rise."
76068,76069,Pericles,11.0,1.2.65,PERICLES,Sit down: thou art no flatterer:
76069,76070,Pericles,11.0,1.2.66,PERICLES,"I thank thee for it, and heaven forbid"
76070,76071,Pericles,11.0,1.2.67,PERICLES,That kings should let their ears hear their
76071,76072,Pericles,11.0,1.2.68,PERICLES,faults hid!
76072,76073,Pericles,11.0,1.2.69,PERICLES,"Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,"
76073,76074,Pericles,11.0,1.2.70,PERICLES,"Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,"
76074,76075,Pericles,11.0,1.2.71,PERICLES,What wouldst thou have me do?
76075,76076,Pericles,12.0,1.2.72,HELICANUS,To bear with patience
76076,76077,Pericles,12.0,1.2.73,HELICANUS,Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
76077,76078,Pericles,13.0,1.2.74,PERICLES,"Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,"
76078,76079,Pericles,13.0,1.2.75,PERICLES,That minister'st a potion unto me
76079,76080,Pericles,13.0,1.2.76,PERICLES,That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
76080,76081,Pericles,13.0,1.2.77,PERICLES,"Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,"
76081,76082,Pericles,13.0,1.2.78,PERICLES,"Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,"
76082,76083,Pericles,13.0,1.2.79,PERICLES,I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
76083,76084,Pericles,13.0,1.2.80,PERICLES,"From whence an issue I might propagate,"
76084,76085,Pericles,13.0,1.2.81,PERICLES,"Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects."
76085,76086,Pericles,13.0,1.2.82,PERICLES,"Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder,"
76086,76087,Pericles,13.0,1.2.83,PERICLES,The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
76087,76088,Pericles,13.0,1.2.84,PERICLES,"Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father"
76088,76089,Pericles,13.0,1.2.85,PERICLES,"Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou"
76089,76090,Pericles,13.0,1.2.86,PERICLES,"know'st this,"
76090,76091,Pericles,13.0,1.2.87,PERICLES,'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
76091,76092,Pericles,13.0,1.2.88,PERICLES,"Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,"

76097,76098,Pericles,13.0,1.2.94,PERICLES,"And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,"
76098,76099,Pericles,13.0,1.2.95,PERICLES,That I should open to the listening air
76099,76100,Pericles,13.0,1.2.96,PERICLES,"How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,"
76100,76101,Pericles,13.0,1.2.97,PERICLES,"To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,"
76101,76102,Pericles,13.0,1.2.98,PERICLES,"To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,"
76102,76103,Pericles,13.0,1.2.99,PERICLES,And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
76103,76104,Pericles,13.0,1.2.100,PERICLES,"When all, for mine, if I may call offence,"
76104,76105,Pericles,13.0,1.2.101,PERICLES,"Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:"
76105,76106,Pericles,13.0,1.2.102,PERICLES,"Which love to all, of which thyself art one,"

76107,76108,Pericles,14.0,1.2.104,HELICANUS,"Alas, sir!"
76108,76109,Pericles,15.0,1.2.105,PERICLES,"Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,"
76109,76110,Pericles,15.0,1.2.106,PERICLES,"Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts"
76110,76111,Pericles,15.0,1.2.107,PERICLES,"How I might stop this tempest ere it came,"
76111,76112,Pericles,15.0,1.2.108,PERICLES,"And finding little comfort to relieve them,"
76112,76113,Pericles,15.0,1.2.109,PERICLES,I thought it princely charity to grieve them.
76113,76114,Pericles,16.0,1.2.110,HELICANUS,"Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak."
76114,76115,Pericles,16.0,1.2.111,HELICANUS,"Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,"
76115,76116,Pericles,16.0,1.2.112,HELICANUS,"And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,"
76116,76117,Pericles,16.0,1.2.113,HELICANUS,Who either by public war or private treason
76117,76118,Pericles,16.0,1.2.114,HELICANUS,Will take away your life.
76118,76119,Pericles,16.0,1.2.115,HELICANUS,"Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,"
76119,76120,Pericles,16.0,1.2.116,HELICANUS,"Till that his rage and anger be forgot,"
76120,76121,Pericles,16.0,1.2.117,HELICANUS,Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
76121,76122,Pericles,16.0,1.2.118,HELICANUS,"Your rule direct to any, if to me."
76122,76123,Pericles,16.0,1.2.119,HELICANUS,Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.
76123,76124,Pericles,17.0,1.2.120,PERICLES,"I do not doubt thy faith,"
76124,76125,Pericles,17.0,1.2.121,PERICLES,But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
76125,76126,Pericles,18.0,1.2.122,HELICANUS,"We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,"
76126,76127,Pericles,18.0,1.2.123,HELICANUS,From whence we had our being and our birth.
76127,76128,Pericles,19.0,1.2.124,PERICLES,"Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus"
76128,76129,Pericles,19.0,1.2.125,PERICLES,"Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee,"
76129,76130,Pericles,19.0,1.2.126,PERICLES,And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
76130,76131,Pericles,19.0,1.2.127,PERICLES,The care I had and have of subjects' good
76131,76132,Pericles,19.0,1.2.128,PERICLES,On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
76132,76133,Pericles,19.0,1.2.129,PERICLES,"I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:"

76141,76142,Pericles,1.0,1.3.2,THALIARD,"kill King Pericles, and if I do it not, I am sure to"
76142,76143,Pericles,1.0,1.3.3,THALIARD,"be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive"
76143,76144,Pericles,1.0,1.3.4,THALIARD,"he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,"
76144,76145,Pericles,1.0,1.3.5,THALIARD,"being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired"
76145,76146,Pericles,1.0,1.3.6,THALIARD,he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
76146,76147,Pericles,1.0,1.3.7,THALIARD,"had some reason for't, for if a king bid a man be a"
76147,76148,Pericles,1.0,1.3.8,THALIARD,"villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to"
76148,76149,Pericles,1.0,1.3.9,THALIARD,be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.
76149,76150,Pericles,1.0,,THALIARD,"Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre"
76150,76151,Pericles,2.0,1.3.10,HELICANUS,"You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,"

76153,76154,Pericles,2.0,1.3.13,HELICANUS,Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.
76154,76155,Pericles,3.0,1.3.14,THALIARD,[Aside]  How! the king gone!
76155,76156,Pericles,4.0,1.3.15,HELICANUS,"If further yet you will be satisfied,"
76156,76157,Pericles,4.0,1.3.16,HELICANUS,"Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,"
76157,76158,Pericles,4.0,1.3.17,HELICANUS,"He would depart, I'll give some light unto you."
76158,76159,Pericles,4.0,1.3.18,HELICANUS,Being at Antioch--

76161,76162,Pericles,6.0,1.3.21,HELICANUS,"Took some displeasure at him, at least he judged so:"
76162,76163,Pericles,6.0,1.3.22,HELICANUS,"And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,"
76163,76164,Pericles,6.0,1.3.23,HELICANUS,"To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself,"
76164,76165,Pericles,6.0,1.3.24,HELICANUS,"So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,"
76165,76166,Pericles,6.0,1.3.25,HELICANUS,With whom each minute threatens life or death.
76166,76167,Pericles,7.0,1.3.26,THALIARD,"[Aside]  Well, I perceive"
76167,76168,Pericles,7.0,1.3.27,THALIARD,"I shall not be hang'd now, although I would,"
76168,76169,Pericles,7.0,1.3.28,THALIARD,"But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:"

76173,76174,Pericles,9.0,1.3.33,THALIARD,"With message unto princely Pericles,"
76174,76175,Pericles,9.0,1.3.34,THALIARD,But since my landing I have understood
76175,76176,Pericles,9.0,1.3.35,THALIARD,"Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,"
76176,76177,Pericles,9.0,1.3.36,THALIARD,My message must return from whence it came.
76177,76178,Pericles,10.0,1.3.37,HELICANUS,"We have no reason to desire it,"
76178,76179,Pericles,10.0,1.3.38,HELICANUS,"Commended to our master, not to us:"
76179,76180,Pericles,10.0,1.3.39,HELICANUS,"Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,"
76180,76181,Pericles,10.0,1.3.40,HELICANUS,"As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre."

76185,76186,Pericles,1.0,1.4.2,CLEON,"And by relating tales of others' griefs,"
76186,76187,Pericles,1.0,1.4.3,CLEON,See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
76187,76188,Pericles,2.0,1.4.4,DIONYZA,"That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it,"
76188,76189,Pericles,2.0,1.4.5,DIONYZA,For who digs hills because they do aspire
76189,76190,Pericles,2.0,1.4.6,DIONYZA,Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
76190,76191,Pericles,2.0,1.4.7,DIONYZA,"O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are,"
76191,76192,Pericles,2.0,1.4.8,DIONYZA,"Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,"
76192,76193,Pericles,2.0,1.4.9,DIONYZA,"But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise."
76193,76194,Pericles,3.0,1.4.10,CLEON,"O Dionyza,"
76194,76195,Pericles,3.0,1.4.11,CLEON,"Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,"
76195,76196,Pericles,3.0,1.4.12,CLEON,Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
76196,76197,Pericles,3.0,1.4.13,CLEON,Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
76197,76198,Pericles,3.0,1.4.14,CLEON,"Our woes into the air, our eyes do weep,"
76198,76199,Pericles,3.0,1.4.15,CLEON,"Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder,"
76199,76200,Pericles,3.0,1.4.16,CLEON,"That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,"
76200,76201,Pericles,3.0,1.4.17,CLEON,They may awake their helps to comfort them.
76201,76202,Pericles,3.0,1.4.18,CLEON,"I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,"
76202,76203,Pericles,3.0,1.4.19,CLEON,And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
76203,76204,Pericles,4.0,1.4.20,DIONYZA,"I'll do my best, sir."
76204,76205,Pericles,5.0,1.4.21,CLEON,"This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,"
76205,76206,Pericles,5.0,1.4.22,CLEON,"A city on whom plenty held full hand,"
76206,76207,Pericles,5.0,1.4.23,CLEON,"For riches strew'd herself even in the streets,"
76207,76208,Pericles,5.0,1.4.24,CLEON,"Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,"
76208,76209,Pericles,5.0,1.4.25,CLEON,"And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at,"
76209,76210,Pericles,5.0,1.4.26,CLEON,"Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,"
76210,76211,Pericles,5.0,1.4.27,CLEON,Like one another's glass to trim them by:
76211,76212,Pericles,5.0,1.4.28,CLEON,"Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,"
76212,76213,Pericles,5.0,1.4.29,CLEON,"And not so much to feed on as delight,"
76213,76214,Pericles,5.0,1.4.30,CLEON,"All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,"
76214,76215,Pericles,5.0,1.4.31,CLEON,The name of help grew odious to repeat.
76215,76216,Pericles,6.0,1.4.32,DIONYZA,"O, 'tis too true."
76216,76217,Pericles,7.0,1.4.33,CLEON,"But see what heaven can do! By this our change,"
76217,76218,Pericles,7.0,1.4.34,CLEON,"These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,"
76218,76219,Pericles,7.0,1.4.35,CLEON,"Were all too little to content and please,"
76219,76220,Pericles,7.0,1.4.36,CLEON,"Although they gave their creatures in abundance,"
76220,76221,Pericles,7.0,1.4.37,CLEON,"As houses are defiled for want of use,"
76221,76222,Pericles,7.0,1.4.38,CLEON,They are now starved for want of exercise:
76222,76223,Pericles,7.0,1.4.39,CLEON,"Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,"
76223,76224,Pericles,7.0,1.4.40,CLEON,"Must have inventions to delight the taste,"
76224,76225,Pericles,7.0,1.4.41,CLEON,"Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:"
76225,76226,Pericles,7.0,1.4.42,CLEON,"Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,"
76226,76227,Pericles,7.0,1.4.43,CLEON,"Thought nought too curious, are ready now"
76227,76228,Pericles,7.0,1.4.44,CLEON,To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
76228,76229,Pericles,7.0,1.4.45,CLEON,"So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife"
76229,76230,Pericles,7.0,1.4.46,CLEON,Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
76230,76231,Pericles,7.0,1.4.47,CLEON,"Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping,"
76231,76232,Pericles,7.0,1.4.48,CLEON,"Here many sink, yet those which see them fall"
76232,76233,Pericles,7.0,1.4.49,CLEON,Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
76233,76234,Pericles,7.0,1.4.50,CLEON,Is not this true?
76234,76235,Pericles,8.0,1.4.51,DIONYZA,Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
76235,76236,Pericles,9.0,1.4.52,CLEON,"O, let those cities that of plenty's cup"
76236,76237,Pericles,9.0,1.4.53,CLEON,"And her prosperities so largely taste,"
76237,76238,Pericles,9.0,1.4.54,CLEON,"With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!"
76238,76239,Pericles,9.0,1.4.55,CLEON,The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
76239,76240,Pericles,9.0,,CLEON,Enter a Lord
76240,76241,Pericles,10.0,1.4.56,Lord,Where's the lord governor?
76241,76242,Pericles,11.0,1.4.57,CLEON,Here.
76242,76243,Pericles,11.0,1.4.58,CLEON,"Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,"
76243,76244,Pericles,11.0,1.4.59,CLEON,For comfort is too far for us to expect.
76244,76245,Pericles,12.0,1.4.60,Lord,"We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,"
76245,76246,Pericles,12.0,1.4.61,Lord,A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
76246,76247,Pericles,13.0,1.4.62,CLEON,I thought as much.
76247,76248,Pericles,13.0,1.4.63,CLEON,"One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,"
76248,76249,Pericles,13.0,1.4.64,CLEON,"That may succeed as his inheritor,"
76249,76250,Pericles,13.0,1.4.65,CLEON,"And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,"
76250,76251,Pericles,13.0,1.4.66,CLEON,"Taking advantage of our misery,"
76251,76252,Pericles,13.0,1.4.67,CLEON,"Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,"
76252,76253,Pericles,13.0,1.4.68,CLEON,"To beat us down, the which are down already,"
76253,76254,Pericles,13.0,1.4.69,CLEON,"And make a conquest of unhappy me,"
76254,76255,Pericles,13.0,1.4.70,CLEON,Whereas no glory's got to overcome.
76255,76256,Pericles,14.0,1.4.71,Lord,"That's the least fear, for, by the semblance"
76256,76257,Pericles,14.0,1.4.72,Lord,"Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,"
76257,76258,Pericles,14.0,1.4.73,Lord,"And come to us as favourers, not as foes."
76258,76259,Pericles,15.0,1.4.74,CLEON,Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
76259,76260,Pericles,15.0,1.4.75,CLEON,Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
76260,76261,Pericles,15.0,1.4.76,CLEON,"But bring they what they will and what they can,"
76261,76262,Pericles,15.0,1.4.77,CLEON,What need we fear?
76262,76263,Pericles,15.0,1.4.78,CLEON,"The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there."
76263,76264,Pericles,15.0,1.4.79,CLEON,"Go tell their general we attend him here,"
76264,76265,Pericles,15.0,1.4.80,CLEON,"To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,"
76265,76266,Pericles,15.0,1.4.81,CLEON,And what he craves.
76266,76267,Pericles,16.0,1.4.82,Lord,"I go, my lord."
76267,76268,Pericles,16.0,,Lord,Exit
76268,76269,Pericles,17.0,1.4.83,CLEON,"Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist,"
76269,76270,Pericles,17.0,1.4.84,CLEON,"If wars, we are unable to resist."
76270,76271,Pericles,17.0,,CLEON,Enter PERICLES with Attendants
76271,76272,Pericles,18.0,1.4.85,PERICLES,"Lord governor, for so we hear you are,"
76272,76273,Pericles,18.0,1.4.86,PERICLES,Let not our ships and number of our men
76273,76274,Pericles,18.0,1.4.87,PERICLES,Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.
76274,76275,Pericles,18.0,1.4.88,PERICLES,"We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,"
76275,76276,Pericles,18.0,1.4.89,PERICLES,And seen the desolation of your streets:
76276,76277,Pericles,18.0,1.4.90,PERICLES,"Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,"
76277,76278,Pericles,18.0,1.4.91,PERICLES,"But to relieve them of their heavy load,"
76278,76279,Pericles,18.0,1.4.92,PERICLES,"And these our ships, you happily may think"
76279,76280,Pericles,18.0,1.4.93,PERICLES,Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
76280,76281,Pericles,18.0,1.4.94,PERICLES,"With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,"
76281,76282,Pericles,18.0,1.4.95,PERICLES,"Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,"
76282,76283,Pericles,18.0,1.4.96,PERICLES,And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.
76283,76284,Pericles,19.0,1.4.97,All,The gods of Greece protect you!
76284,76285,Pericles,19.0,1.4.98,All,And we'll pray for you.
76285,76286,Pericles,20.0,1.4.99,PERICLES,"Arise, I pray you, rise:"
76286,76287,Pericles,20.0,1.4.100,PERICLES,"We do not look for reverence, but to love,"
76287,76288,Pericles,20.0,1.4.101,PERICLES,"And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men."
76288,76289,Pericles,21.0,1.4.102,CLEON,"The which when any shall not gratify,"
76289,76290,Pericles,21.0,1.4.103,CLEON,"Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,"
76290,76291,Pericles,21.0,1.4.104,CLEON,"Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,"
76291,76292,Pericles,21.0,1.4.105,CLEON,The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
76292,76293,Pericles,21.0,1.4.106,CLEON,"Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--"
76293,76294,Pericles,21.0,1.4.107,CLEON,Your grace is welcome to our town and us.
76294,76295,Pericles,22.0,1.4.108,PERICLES,"Which welcome we'll accept, feast here awhile,"
76295,76296,Pericles,22.0,1.4.109,PERICLES,Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

76301,76302,Pericles,23.0,2.4.112,GOWER,"A better prince and benign lord,"
76302,76303,Pericles,23.0,2.4.113,GOWER,That will prove awful both in deed and word.
76303,76304,Pericles,23.0,2.4.114,GOWER,"Be quiet then as men should be,"
76304,76305,Pericles,23.0,2.4.115,GOWER,Till he hath pass'd necessity.
76305,76306,Pericles,23.0,2.4.116,GOWER,"I'll show you those in troubles reign,"

76384,76385,Pericles,14.0,2.1.40,Third Fisherman,Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I

76505,76506,Pericles,53.0,2.1.159,Second Fisherman,We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
76506,76507,Pericles,53.0,2.1.160,Second Fisherman,"make thee a pair, and I'll bring thee to the court myself."
76507,76508,Pericles,54.0,2.1.161,PERICLES,"Then honour be but a goal to my will,"
76508,76509,Pericles,54.0,2.1.162,PERICLES,"This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill."
76509,76510,Pericles,54.0,,PERICLES,Exeunt
76510,76511,Pericles,54.0,,PERICLES,SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the
76511,76512,Pericles,54.0,2.2.1,PERICLES,lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the
76512,76513,Pericles,54.0,2.2.2,PERICLES,"reception of King, Princess, Lords,  and c."
76513,76514,Pericles,54.0,,PERICLES,"Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants"
76514,76515,Pericles,1.0,2.2.3,SIMONIDES,Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
76515,76516,Pericles,2.0,2.2.4,First Lord,"They are, my liege,"
76516,76517,Pericles,2.0,2.2.5,First Lord,And stay your coming to present themselves.
76517,76518,Pericles,3.0,2.2.6,SIMONIDES,"Return them, we are ready, and our daughter,"
76518,76519,Pericles,3.0,2.2.7,SIMONIDES,"In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,"
76519,76520,Pericles,3.0,2.2.8,SIMONIDES,"Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat"
76520,76521,Pericles,3.0,2.2.9,SIMONIDES,"For men to see, and seeing wonder at."
76521,76522,Pericles,3.0,,SIMONIDES,Exit a Lord
76522,76523,Pericles,4.0,2.2.10,THAISA,"It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express"
76523,76524,Pericles,4.0,2.2.11,THAISA,"My commendations great, whose merit's less."
76524,76525,Pericles,5.0,2.2.12,SIMONIDES,"It's fit it should be so, for princes are"
76525,76526,Pericles,5.0,2.2.13,SIMONIDES,A model which heaven makes like to itself:
76526,76527,Pericles,5.0,2.2.14,SIMONIDES,"As jewels lose their glory if neglected,"
76527,76528,Pericles,5.0,2.2.15,SIMONIDES,So princes their renowns if not respected.
76528,76529,Pericles,5.0,2.2.16,SIMONIDES,"'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain"
76529,76530,Pericles,5.0,2.2.17,SIMONIDES,The labour of each knight in his device.
76530,76531,Pericles,6.0,2.2.18,THAISA,"Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform."
76531,76532,Pericles,6.0,2.2.18,THAISA,"Enter a Knight, he passes over, and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess"
76532,76533,Pericles,7.0,2.2.19,SIMONIDES,Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
76533,76534,Pericles,8.0,2.2.20,THAISA,"A knight of Sparta, my renowned father,"
76534,76535,Pericles,8.0,2.2.21,THAISA,And the device he bears upon his shield
76535,76536,Pericles,8.0,2.2.22,THAISA,Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
76536,76537,Pericles,8.0,2.2.23,THAISA,"The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'"
76537,76538,Pericles,9.0,2.2.24,SIMONIDES,He loves you well that holds his life of you.
76538,76539,Pericles,9.0,,SIMONIDES,The Second Knight passes over
76539,76540,Pericles,9.0,2.2.25,SIMONIDES,Who is the second that presents himself?
76540,76541,Pericles,10.0,2.2.26,THAISA,"A prince of Macedon, my royal father,"
76541,76542,Pericles,10.0,2.2.27,THAISA,And the device he bears upon his shield
76542,76543,Pericles,10.0,2.2.28,THAISA,"Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady,"
76543,76544,Pericles,10.0,2.2.29,THAISA,"The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'"
76544,76545,Pericles,10.0,,THAISA,The Third Knight passes over
76545,76546,Pericles,11.0,2.2.30,SIMONIDES,And what's the third?
76546,76547,Pericles,12.0,2.2.31,THAISA,"The third of Antioch,"
76547,76548,Pericles,12.0,2.2.32,THAISA,"And his device, a wreath of chivalry,"
76548,76549,Pericles,12.0,2.2.33,THAISA,"The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'"
76549,76550,Pericles,12.0,,THAISA,The Fourth Knight passes over
76550,76551,Pericles,13.0,2.2.34,SIMONIDES,What is the fourth?
76551,76552,Pericles,14.0,2.2.35,THAISA,"A burning torch that's turned upside down,"
76552,76553,Pericles,14.0,2.2.36,THAISA,"The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'"
76553,76554,Pericles,15.0,2.2.37,SIMONIDES,"Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,"
76554,76555,Pericles,15.0,2.2.38,SIMONIDES,Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
76555,76556,Pericles,15.0,,SIMONIDES,The Fifth Knight passes over
76556,76557,Pericles,16.0,2.2.39,THAISA,"The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,"
76557,76558,Pericles,16.0,2.2.40,THAISA,"Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried,"
76558,76559,Pericles,16.0,2.2.41,THAISA,"The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'"
76559,76560,Pericles,16.0,,THAISA,"The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over"
76560,76561,Pericles,17.0,2.2.42,SIMONIDES,And what's
76561,76562,Pericles,17.0,2.2.43,SIMONIDES,"The sixth and last, the which the knight himself"
76562,76563,Pericles,17.0,2.2.44,SIMONIDES,With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
76563,76564,Pericles,18.0,2.2.45,THAISA,"He seems to be a stranger, but his present is"
76564,76565,Pericles,18.0,2.2.46,THAISA,"A wither'd branch, that's only green at top,"
76565,76566,Pericles,18.0,2.2.47,THAISA,"The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'"
76566,76567,Pericles,19.0,2.2.48,SIMONIDES,"A pretty moral,"
76567,76568,Pericles,19.0,2.2.49,SIMONIDES,"From the dejected state wherein he is,"
76568,76569,Pericles,19.0,2.2.50,SIMONIDES,He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.
76569,76570,Pericles,20.0,2.2.51,First Lord,He had need mean better than his outward show
76570,76571,Pericles,20.0,2.2.52,First Lord,"Can any way speak in his just commend,"
76571,76572,Pericles,20.0,2.2.53,First Lord,For by his rusty outside he appears
76572,76573,Pericles,20.0,2.2.54,First Lord,To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.
76573,76574,Pericles,21.0,2.2.55,Second Lord,"He well may be a stranger, for he comes"
76574,76575,Pericles,21.0,2.2.56,Second Lord,To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.
76575,76576,Pericles,22.0,2.2.57,Third Lord,And on set purpose let his armour rust
76576,76577,Pericles,22.0,2.2.58,Third Lord,"Until this day, to scour it in the dust."
76577,76578,Pericles,23.0,2.2.59,SIMONIDES,"Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan"
76578,76579,Pericles,23.0,2.2.60,SIMONIDES,The outward habit by the inward man.
76579,76580,Pericles,23.0,2.2.61,SIMONIDES,"But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw"
76580,76581,Pericles,23.0,2.2.62,SIMONIDES,Into the gallery.
76581,76582,Pericles,23.0,,SIMONIDES,Exeunt
76582,76583,Pericles,23.0,,SIMONIDES,Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'
76583,76584,Pericles,23.0,,SIMONIDES,SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.
76584,76585,Pericles,23.0,,SIMONIDES,"Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and Knights, from tilting"
76585,76586,Pericles,1.0,2.3.1,SIMONIDES,"Knights,"
76586,76587,Pericles,1.0,2.3.2,SIMONIDES,To say you're welcome were superfluous.
76587,76588,Pericles,1.0,2.3.3,SIMONIDES,"To place upon the volume of your deeds,"
76588,76589,Pericles,1.0,2.3.4,SIMONIDES,"As in a title-page, your worth in arms,"
76589,76590,Pericles,1.0,2.3.5,SIMONIDES,"Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,"
76590,76591,Pericles,1.0,2.3.6,SIMONIDES,Since every worth in show commends itself.
76591,76592,Pericles,1.0,2.3.7,SIMONIDES,"Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:"
76592,76593,Pericles,1.0,2.3.8,SIMONIDES,You are princes and my guests.
76593,76594,Pericles,2.0,2.3.9,THAISA,"But you, my knight and guest,"
76594,76595,Pericles,2.0,2.3.10,THAISA,"To whom this wreath of victory I give,"
76595,76596,Pericles,2.0,2.3.11,THAISA,And crown you king of this day's happiness.
76596,76597,Pericles,3.0,2.3.12,PERICLES,"'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit."
76597,76598,Pericles,4.0,2.3.13,SIMONIDES,"Call it by what you will, the day is yours,"
76598,76599,Pericles,4.0,2.3.14,SIMONIDES,"And here, I hope, is none that envies it."
76599,76600,Pericles,4.0,2.3.15,SIMONIDES,"In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,"
76600,76601,Pericles,4.0,2.3.16,SIMONIDES,"To make some good, but others to exceed,"
76601,76602,Pericles,4.0,2.3.17,SIMONIDES,"And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'"
76602,76603,Pericles,4.0,2.3.18,SIMONIDES,"the feast,--"
76603,76604,Pericles,4.0,2.3.19,SIMONIDES,"For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:"
76604,76605,Pericles,4.0,2.3.20,SIMONIDES,"Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace."
76605,76606,Pericles,5.0,2.3.21,KNIGHTS,We are honour'd much by good Simonides.
76606,76607,Pericles,6.0,2.3.22,SIMONIDES,"Your presence glads our days: honour we love,"
76607,76608,Pericles,6.0,2.3.23,SIMONIDES,For who hates honour hates the gods above.
76608,76609,Pericles,7.0,2.3.24,Marshal,"Sir, yonder is your place."
76609,76610,Pericles,8.0,2.3.25,PERICLES,Some other is more fit.
76610,76611,Pericles,9.0,2.3.26,First Knight,"Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen"
76611,76612,Pericles,9.0,2.3.27,First Knight,That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
76612,76613,Pericles,9.0,2.3.28,First Knight,Envy the great nor do the low despise.
76613,76614,Pericles,10.0,2.3.29,PERICLES,You are right courteous knights.
76614,76615,Pericles,11.0,2.3.30,SIMONIDES,"Sit, sir, sit."
76615,76616,Pericles,12.0,2.3.31,PERICLES,"By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,"
76616,76617,Pericles,12.0,2.3.32,PERICLES,"These cates resist me, she but thought upon."
76617,76618,Pericles,13.0,2.3.33,THAISA,"By Juno, that is queen of marriage,"
76618,76619,Pericles,13.0,2.3.34,THAISA,All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.
76619,76620,Pericles,13.0,2.3.35,THAISA,"Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman."
76620,76621,Pericles,14.0,2.3.36,SIMONIDES,"He's but a country gentleman,"
76621,76622,Pericles,14.0,2.3.37,SIMONIDES,"Has done no more than other knights have done,"
76622,76623,Pericles,14.0,2.3.38,SIMONIDES,"Has broken a staff or so, so let it pass."
76623,76624,Pericles,15.0,2.3.39,THAISA,To me he seems like diamond to glass.
76624,76625,Pericles,16.0,2.3.40,PERICLES,"Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,"
76625,76626,Pericles,16.0,2.3.41,PERICLES,"Which tells me in that glory once he was,"
76626,76627,Pericles,16.0,2.3.42,PERICLES,"Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,"
76627,76628,Pericles,16.0,2.3.43,PERICLES,"And he the sun, for them to reverence,"
76628,76629,Pericles,16.0,2.3.44,PERICLES,"None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,"
76629,76630,Pericles,16.0,2.3.45,PERICLES,Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:
76630,76631,Pericles,16.0,2.3.46,PERICLES,"Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,"
76631,76632,Pericles,16.0,2.3.47,PERICLES,"The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:"
76632,76633,Pericles,16.0,2.3.48,PERICLES,"Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,"
76633,76634,Pericles,16.0,2.3.49,PERICLES,"He's both their parent, and he is their grave,"
76634,76635,Pericles,16.0,2.3.50,PERICLES,"And gives them what he will, not what they crave."
76635,76636,Pericles,17.0,2.3.51,SIMONIDES,"What, are you merry, knights?"
76636,76637,Pericles,18.0,2.3.52,Knights,Who can be other in this royal presence?
76637,76638,Pericles,19.0,2.3.53,SIMONIDES,"Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--"
76638,76639,Pericles,19.0,2.3.54,SIMONIDES,"As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--"
76639,76640,Pericles,19.0,2.3.55,SIMONIDES,We drink this health to you.
76640,76641,Pericles,20.0,2.3.56,KNIGHTS,We thank your grace.
76641,76642,Pericles,21.0,2.3.57,SIMONIDES,Yet pause awhile:
76642,76643,Pericles,21.0,2.3.58,SIMONIDES,"Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,"
76643,76644,Pericles,21.0,2.3.59,SIMONIDES,As if the entertainment in our court
76644,76645,Pericles,21.0,2.3.60,SIMONIDES,Had not a show might countervail his worth.
76645,76646,Pericles,21.0,2.3.61,SIMONIDES,"Note it not you, Thaisa?"
76646,76647,Pericles,22.0,2.3.62,THAISA,What is it
76647,76648,Pericles,22.0,2.3.63,THAISA,"To me, my father?"
76648,76649,Pericles,23.0,2.3.64,SIMONIDES,"O, attend, my daughter:"
76649,76650,Pericles,23.0,2.3.65,SIMONIDES,"Princes in this should live like gods above,"
76650,76651,Pericles,23.0,2.3.66,SIMONIDES,Who freely give to every one that comes
76651,76652,Pericles,23.0,2.3.67,SIMONIDES,To honour them:
76652,76653,Pericles,23.0,2.3.68,SIMONIDES,"And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,"
76653,76654,Pericles,23.0,2.3.69,SIMONIDES,"Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at."
76654,76655,Pericles,23.0,2.3.70,SIMONIDES,"Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,"
76655,76656,Pericles,23.0,2.3.71,SIMONIDES,"Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him."
76656,76657,Pericles,24.0,2.3.72,THAISA,"Alas, my father, it befits not me"
76657,76658,Pericles,24.0,2.3.73,THAISA,Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
76658,76659,Pericles,24.0,2.3.74,THAISA,"He may my proffer take for an offence,"
76659,76660,Pericles,24.0,2.3.75,THAISA,Since men take women's gifts for impudence.
76660,76661,Pericles,25.0,2.3.76,SIMONIDES,How!
76661,76662,Pericles,25.0,2.3.77,SIMONIDES,"Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else."
76662,76663,Pericles,26.0,2.3.78,THAISA,"[Aside]  Now, by the gods, he could not please me better."
76663,76664,Pericles,27.0,2.3.79,SIMONIDES,"And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,"
76664,76665,Pericles,27.0,2.3.80,SIMONIDES,"Of whence he is, his name and parentage."
76665,76666,Pericles,28.0,2.3.81,THAISA,"The king my father, sir, has drunk to you."
76666,76667,Pericles,29.0,2.3.82,PERICLES,I thank him.
76667,76668,Pericles,30.0,2.3.83,THAISA,Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
76668,76669,Pericles,31.0,2.3.84,PERICLES,"I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely."
76669,76670,Pericles,32.0,2.3.85,THAISA,"And further he desires to know of you,"
76670,76671,Pericles,32.0,2.3.86,THAISA,"Of whence you are, your name and parentage."
76671,76672,Pericles,33.0,2.3.87,PERICLES,"A gentleman of Tyre, my name, Pericles,"
76672,76673,Pericles,33.0,2.3.88,PERICLES,"My education been in arts and arms,"
76673,76674,Pericles,33.0,2.3.89,PERICLES,"Who, looking for adventures in the world,"
76674,76675,Pericles,33.0,2.3.90,PERICLES,"Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,"
76675,76676,Pericles,33.0,2.3.91,PERICLES,And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.
76676,76677,Pericles,34.0,2.3.92,THAISA,"He thanks your grace, names himself Pericles,"
76677,76678,Pericles,34.0,2.3.93,THAISA,"A gentleman of Tyre,"
76678,76679,Pericles,34.0,2.3.94,THAISA,Who only by misfortune of the seas
76679,76680,Pericles,34.0,2.3.95,THAISA,"Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore."
76680,76681,Pericles,35.0,2.3.96,SIMONIDES,"Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,"
76681,76682,Pericles,35.0,2.3.97,SIMONIDES,And will awake him from his melancholy.
76682,76683,Pericles,35.0,2.3.98,SIMONIDES,"Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,"
76683,76684,Pericles,35.0,2.3.99,SIMONIDES,"And waste the time, which looks for other revels."
76684,76685,Pericles,35.0,2.3.100,SIMONIDES,"Even in your armours, as you are address'd,"
76685,76686,Pericles,35.0,2.3.101,SIMONIDES,Will very well become a soldier's dance.
76686,76687,Pericles,35.0,2.3.102,SIMONIDES,"I will not have excuse, with saying this"
76687,76688,Pericles,35.0,2.3.103,SIMONIDES,"Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,"
76688,76689,Pericles,35.0,2.3.104,SIMONIDES,Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
76689,76690,Pericles,35.0,,SIMONIDES,The Knights dance
76690,76691,Pericles,35.0,2.3.105,SIMONIDES,"So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd."
76691,76692,Pericles,35.0,2.3.106,SIMONIDES,"Come, sir,"
76692,76693,Pericles,35.0,2.3.107,SIMONIDES,Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
76693,76694,Pericles,35.0,2.3.108,SIMONIDES,"And I have heard, you knights of Tyre"
76694,76695,Pericles,35.0,2.3.109,SIMONIDES,"Are excellent in making ladies trip,"
76695,76696,Pericles,35.0,2.3.110,SIMONIDES,And that their measures are as excellent.
76696,76697,Pericles,36.0,2.3.111,PERICLES,"In those that practise them they are, my lord."
76697,76698,Pericles,37.0,2.3.112,SIMONIDES,"O, that's as much as you would be denied"
76698,76699,Pericles,37.0,2.3.113,SIMONIDES,Of your fair courtesy.
76699,76700,Pericles,37.0,,SIMONIDES,The Knights and Ladies dance
76700,76701,Pericles,37.0,2.3.114,SIMONIDES,"Unclasp, unclasp:"
76701,76702,Pericles,37.0,2.3.115,SIMONIDES,"Thanks, gentlemen, to all, all have done well."
76702,76703,Pericles,37.0,,SIMONIDES,To PERICLES
76703,76704,Pericles,37.0,2.3.116,SIMONIDES,"But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct"
76704,76705,Pericles,37.0,2.3.117,SIMONIDES,These knights unto their several lodgings!
76705,76706,Pericles,37.0,,SIMONIDES,To PERICLES
76706,76707,Pericles,37.0,2.3.118,SIMONIDES,"Yours, sir,"
76707,76708,Pericles,37.0,2.3.119,SIMONIDES,We have given order to be next our own.
76708,76709,Pericles,38.0,2.3.120,PERICLES,I am at your grace's pleasure.
76709,76710,Pericles,39.0,2.3.121,SIMONIDES,"Princes, it is too late to talk of love,"
76710,76711,Pericles,39.0,2.3.122,SIMONIDES,And that's the mark I know you level at:
76711,76712,Pericles,39.0,2.3.123,SIMONIDES,"Therefore each one betake him to his rest,"
76712,76713,Pericles,39.0,2.3.124,SIMONIDES,To-morrow all for speeding do their best.

76716,76717,Pericles,1.0,2.4.1,HELICANUS,"No, Escanes, know this of me,"
76717,76718,Pericles,1.0,2.4.2,HELICANUS,Antiochus from incest lived not free:
76718,76719,Pericles,1.0,2.4.3,HELICANUS,"For which, the most high gods not minding longer"
76719,76720,Pericles,1.0,2.4.4,HELICANUS,"To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,"
76720,76721,Pericles,1.0,2.4.5,HELICANUS,"Due to this heinous capital offence,"
76721,76722,Pericles,1.0,2.4.6,HELICANUS,"Even in the height and pride of all his glory,"
76722,76723,Pericles,1.0,2.4.7,HELICANUS,When he was seated in a chariot
76723,76724,Pericles,1.0,2.4.8,HELICANUS,"Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,"
76724,76725,Pericles,1.0,2.4.9,HELICANUS,A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
76725,76726,Pericles,1.0,2.4.10,HELICANUS,"Their bodies, even to loathing, for they so stunk,"
76726,76727,Pericles,1.0,2.4.11,HELICANUS,That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
76727,76728,Pericles,1.0,2.4.12,HELICANUS,Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
76728,76729,Pericles,2.0,2.4.13,ESCANES,'Twas very strange.
76729,76730,Pericles,3.0,2.4.14,HELICANUS,"And yet but justice, for though"
76730,76731,Pericles,3.0,2.4.15,HELICANUS,"This king were great, his greatness was no guard"
76731,76732,Pericles,3.0,2.4.16,HELICANUS,"To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward."
76732,76733,Pericles,4.0,2.4.17,ESCANES,'Tis very true.
76733,76734,Pericles,4.0,,ESCANES,Enter two or three Lords
76734,76735,Pericles,5.0,2.4.18,First Lord,"See, not a man in private conference"
76735,76736,Pericles,5.0,2.4.19,First Lord,Or council has respect with him but he.
76736,76737,Pericles,6.0,2.4.20,Second Lord,It shall no longer grieve without reproof.
76737,76738,Pericles,7.0,2.4.21,Third Lord,And cursed be he that will not second it.
76738,76739,Pericles,8.0,2.4.22,First Lord,"Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word."
76739,76740,Pericles,9.0,2.4.23,HELICANUS,"With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords."
76740,76741,Pericles,10.0,2.4.24,First Lord,"Know that our griefs are risen to the top,"
76741,76742,Pericles,10.0,2.4.25,First Lord,And now at length they overflow their banks.
76742,76743,Pericles,11.0,2.4.26,HELICANUS,Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.
76743,76744,Pericles,12.0,2.4.27,First Lord,"Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane,"
76744,76745,Pericles,12.0,2.4.28,First Lord,"But if the prince do live, let us salute him,"
76745,76746,Pericles,12.0,2.4.29,First Lord,Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
76746,76747,Pericles,12.0,2.4.30,First Lord,"If in the world he live, we'll seek him out,"
76747,76748,Pericles,12.0,2.4.31,First Lord,"If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there,"
76748,76749,Pericles,12.0,2.4.32,First Lord,"And be resolved he lives to govern us,"
76749,76750,Pericles,12.0,2.4.33,First Lord,"Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,"
76750,76751,Pericles,12.0,2.4.34,First Lord,And leave us to our free election.
76751,76752,Pericles,13.0,2.4.35,Second Lord,Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:
76752,76753,Pericles,13.0,2.4.36,Second Lord,"And knowing this kingdom is without a head,--"
76753,76754,Pericles,13.0,2.4.37,Second Lord,Like goodly buildings left without a roof
76754,76755,Pericles,13.0,2.4.38,Second Lord,"Soon fall to ruin,--your noble self,"
76755,76756,Pericles,13.0,2.4.39,Second Lord,"That best know how to rule and how to reign,"
76756,76757,Pericles,13.0,2.4.40,Second Lord,"We thus submit unto,--our sovereign."
76757,76758,Pericles,14.0,2.4.41,All,"Live, noble Helicane!"
76758,76759,Pericles,15.0,2.4.42,HELICANUS,"For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:"
76759,76760,Pericles,15.0,2.4.43,HELICANUS,"If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear."
76760,76761,Pericles,15.0,2.4.44,HELICANUS,"Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,"
76761,76762,Pericles,15.0,2.4.45,HELICANUS,Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
76762,76763,Pericles,15.0,2.4.46,HELICANUS,"A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to"
76763,76764,Pericles,15.0,2.4.47,HELICANUS,Forbear the absence of your king:
76764,76765,Pericles,15.0,2.4.48,HELICANUS,"If in which time expired, he not return,"
76765,76766,Pericles,15.0,2.4.49,HELICANUS,I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
76766,76767,Pericles,15.0,2.4.50,HELICANUS,"But if I cannot win you to this love,"
76767,76768,Pericles,15.0,2.4.51,HELICANUS,"Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,"
76768,76769,Pericles,15.0,2.4.52,HELICANUS,"And in your search spend your adventurous worth,"
76769,76770,Pericles,15.0,2.4.53,HELICANUS,"Whom if you find, and win unto return,"
76770,76771,Pericles,15.0,2.4.54,HELICANUS,You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
76771,76772,Pericles,16.0,2.4.55,First Lord,"To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield,"
76772,76773,Pericles,16.0,2.4.56,First Lord,"And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,"
76773,76774,Pericles,16.0,2.4.57,First Lord,We with our travels will endeavour us.
76774,76775,Pericles,17.0,2.4.58,HELICANUS,"Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:"
76775,76776,Pericles,17.0,2.4.59,HELICANUS,"When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands."
76776,76777,Pericles,17.0,,HELICANUS,Exeunt

76778,76779,Pericles,17.0,,HELICANUS,"Enter SIMONIDES, reading a letter, at one door: the Knights meet him"
76779,76780,Pericles,1.0,2.5.1,First Knight,Good morrow to the good Simonides.
76780,76781,Pericles,2.0,2.5.2,SIMONIDES,"Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,"
76781,76782,Pericles,2.0,2.5.3,SIMONIDES,That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
76782,76783,Pericles,2.0,2.5.4,SIMONIDES,A married life.
76783,76784,Pericles,2.0,2.5.5,SIMONIDES,"Her reason to herself is only known,"
76784,76785,Pericles,2.0,2.5.6,SIMONIDES,Which yet from her by no means can I get.
76785,76786,Pericles,3.0,2.5.7,Second Knight,"May we not get access to her, my lord?"
76786,76787,Pericles,4.0,2.5.8,SIMONIDES,"'Faith, by no means, she has so strictly tied"
76787,76788,Pericles,4.0,2.5.9,SIMONIDES,"Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible."
76788,76789,Pericles,4.0,2.5.10,SIMONIDES,"One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery,"
76789,76790,Pericles,4.0,2.5.11,SIMONIDES,This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd
76790,76791,Pericles,4.0,2.5.12,SIMONIDES,And on her virgin honour will not break it.
76791,76792,Pericles,5.0,2.5.13,Third Knight,"Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves."
76792,76793,Pericles,5.0,,Third Knight,Exeunt Knights
76793,76794,Pericles,6.0,2.5.14,SIMONIDES,"So,"
76794,76795,Pericles,6.0,2.5.15,SIMONIDES,"They are well dispatch'd, now to my daughter's letter:"
76795,76796,Pericles,6.0,2.5.16,SIMONIDES,"She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,"
76796,76797,Pericles,6.0,2.5.17,SIMONIDES,Or never more to view nor day nor light.
76797,76798,Pericles,6.0,2.5.18,SIMONIDES,"'Tis well, mistress, your choice agrees with mine,"
76798,76799,Pericles,6.0,2.5.19,SIMONIDES,"I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,"
76799,76800,Pericles,6.0,2.5.20,SIMONIDES,Not minding whether I dislike or no!
76800,76801,Pericles,6.0,2.5.21,SIMONIDES,"Well, I do commend her choice,"
76801,76802,Pericles,6.0,2.5.22,SIMONIDES,And will no longer have it be delay'd.
76802,76803,Pericles,6.0,2.5.23,SIMONIDES,Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.
76803,76804,Pericles,6.0,,SIMONIDES,Enter PERICLES
76804,76805,Pericles,7.0,2.5.24,PERICLES,All fortune to the good Simonides!

76806,76807,Pericles,8.0,2.5.26,SIMONIDES,For your sweet music this last night: I do
76807,76808,Pericles,8.0,2.5.27,SIMONIDES,Protest my ears were never better fed
76808,76809,Pericles,8.0,2.5.28,SIMONIDES,With such delightful pleasing harmony.
76809,76810,Pericles,9.0,2.5.29,PERICLES,"It is your grace's pleasure to commend,"
76810,76811,Pericles,9.0,2.5.30,PERICLES,Not my desert.
76811,76812,Pericles,10.0,2.5.31,SIMONIDES,"Sir, you are music's master."
76812,76813,Pericles,11.0,2.5.32,PERICLES,"The worst of all her scholars, my good lord."
76813,76814,Pericles,12.0,2.5.33,SIMONIDES,Let me ask you one thing:
76814,76815,Pericles,12.0,2.5.34,SIMONIDES,"What do you think of my daughter, sir?"
76815,76816,Pericles,13.0,2.5.35,PERICLES,A most virtuous princess.
76816,76817,Pericles,14.0,2.5.36,SIMONIDES,"And she is fair too, is she not?"
76817,76818,Pericles,15.0,2.5.37,PERICLES,"As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair."
76818,76819,Pericles,16.0,2.5.38,SIMONIDES,"Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you,"
76819,76820,Pericles,16.0,2.5.39,SIMONIDES,"Ay, so well, that you must be her master,"
76820,76821,Pericles,16.0,2.5.40,SIMONIDES,And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.
76821,76822,Pericles,17.0,2.5.41,PERICLES,I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.
76822,76823,Pericles,18.0,2.5.42,SIMONIDES,"She thinks not so, peruse this writing else."
76823,76824,Pericles,19.0,2.5.43,PERICLES,[Aside]  What's here?
76824,76825,Pericles,19.0,2.5.44,PERICLES,"A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!"
76825,76826,Pericles,19.0,2.5.45,PERICLES,'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
76826,76827,Pericles,19.0,2.5.46,PERICLES,"O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,"
76827,76828,Pericles,19.0,2.5.47,PERICLES,"A stranger and distressed gentleman,"
76828,76829,Pericles,19.0,2.5.48,PERICLES,"That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,"
76829,76830,Pericles,19.0,2.5.49,PERICLES,But bent all offices to honour her.
76830,76831,Pericles,20.0,2.5.50,SIMONIDES,"Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art"
76831,76832,Pericles,20.0,2.5.51,SIMONIDES,A villain.
76832,76833,Pericles,21.0,2.5.52,PERICLES,"By the gods, I have not:"
76833,76834,Pericles,21.0,2.5.53,PERICLES,"Never did thought of mine levy offence,"
76834,76835,Pericles,21.0,2.5.54,PERICLES,Nor never did my actions yet commence
76835,76836,Pericles,21.0,2.5.55,PERICLES,A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.
76836,76837,Pericles,22.0,2.5.56,SIMONIDES,"Traitor, thou liest."
76837,76838,Pericles,23.0,2.5.57,PERICLES,Traitor!
76838,76839,Pericles,24.0,2.5.58,SIMONIDES,"Ay, traitor."
76839,76840,Pericles,25.0,2.5.59,PERICLES,Even in his throat--unless it be the king--
76840,76841,Pericles,25.0,2.5.60,PERICLES,"That calls me traitor, I return the lie."
76841,76842,Pericles,26.0,2.5.61,SIMONIDES,"[Aside]  Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage."
76842,76843,Pericles,27.0,2.5.62,PERICLES,"My actions are as noble as my thoughts,"
76843,76844,Pericles,27.0,2.5.63,PERICLES,That never relish'd of a base descent.
76844,76845,Pericles,27.0,2.5.64,PERICLES,"I came unto your court for honour's cause,"
76845,76846,Pericles,27.0,2.5.65,PERICLES,"And not to be a rebel to her state,"
76846,76847,Pericles,27.0,2.5.66,PERICLES,"And he that otherwise accounts of me,"
76847,76848,Pericles,27.0,2.5.67,PERICLES,This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.
76848,76849,Pericles,28.0,2.5.68,SIMONIDES,No?
76849,76850,Pericles,28.0,2.5.69,SIMONIDES,"Here comes my daughter, she can witness it."
76850,76851,Pericles,28.0,,SIMONIDES,Enter THAISA
76851,76852,Pericles,29.0,2.5.70,PERICLES,"Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,"
76852,76853,Pericles,29.0,2.5.71,PERICLES,"Resolve your angry father, if my tongue"
76853,76854,Pericles,29.0,2.5.72,PERICLES,"Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe"
76854,76855,Pericles,29.0,2.5.73,PERICLES,To any syllable that made love to you.
76855,76856,Pericles,30.0,2.5.74,THAISA,"Why, sir, say if you had,"
76856,76857,Pericles,30.0,2.5.75,THAISA,Who takes offence at that would make me glad?
76857,76858,Pericles,31.0,2.5.76,SIMONIDES,"Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?"
76858,76859,Pericles,31.0,,SIMONIDES,Aside
76859,76860,Pericles,31.0,2.5.77,SIMONIDES,I am glad on't with all my heart.--
76860,76861,Pericles,31.0,2.5.78,SIMONIDES,"I'll tame you, I'll bring you in subjection."
76861,76862,Pericles,31.0,2.5.79,SIMONIDES,"Will you, not having my consent,"
76862,76863,Pericles,31.0,2.5.80,SIMONIDES,Bestow your love and your affections
76863,76864,Pericles,31.0,2.5.81,SIMONIDES,Upon a stranger?
76864,76865,Pericles,31.0,,SIMONIDES,Aside
76865,76866,Pericles,31.0,2.5.82,SIMONIDES,"who, for aught I know,"
76866,76867,Pericles,31.0,2.5.83,SIMONIDES,"May be, nor can I think the contrary,"
76867,76868,Pericles,31.0,2.5.84,SIMONIDES,As great in blood as I myself.--
76868,76869,Pericles,31.0,2.5.85,SIMONIDES,"Therefore hear you, mistress, either frame"
76869,76870,Pericles,31.0,2.5.86,SIMONIDES,"Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,"
76870,76871,Pericles,31.0,2.5.87,SIMONIDES,"Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--"
76871,76872,Pericles,31.0,2.5.88,SIMONIDES,Man and wife:
76872,76873,Pericles,31.0,2.5.89,SIMONIDES,"Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:"
76873,76874,Pericles,31.0,2.5.90,SIMONIDES,"And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy,"
76874,76875,Pericles,31.0,2.5.91,SIMONIDES,"And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--"
76875,76876,Pericles,31.0,2.5.92,SIMONIDES,"What, are you both pleased?"
76876,76877,Pericles,32.0,2.5.93,THAISA,"Yes, if you love me, sir."
76877,76878,Pericles,33.0,2.5.94,PERICLES,"Even as my life, or blood that fosters it."
76878,76879,Pericles,34.0,2.5.95,SIMONIDES,"What, are you both agreed?"

77263,77264,Pericles,5.0,4.4.28,GOWER,Which makes her both the heart and place
77264,77265,Pericles,5.0,4.4.29,GOWER,"Of general wonder. But, alack,"
77265,77266,Pericles,5.0,4.4.30,GOWER,"That monster envy, oft the wrack"

77276,77277,Pericles,5.0,4.4.41,GOWER,Or when she would with sharp needle wound

77308,77309,Pericles,5.0,,GOWER,Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE
77309,77310,Pericles,1.0,4.1.1,DIONYZA,"Thy oath remember, thou hast sworn to do't:"
77310,77311,Pericles,1.0,4.1.2,DIONYZA,"'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known."
77311,77312,Pericles,1.0,4.1.3,DIONYZA,"Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,"
77312,77313,Pericles,1.0,4.1.4,DIONYZA,"To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,"
77313,77314,Pericles,1.0,4.1.5,DIONYZA,"Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,"
77314,77315,Pericles,1.0,4.1.6,DIONYZA,"Inflame too nicely, nor let pity, which"
77315,77316,Pericles,1.0,4.1.7,DIONYZA,"Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be"

77317,77318,Pericles,2.0,4.1.9,LEONINE,"I will do't, but yet she is a goodly creature."
77318,77319,Pericles,3.0,4.1.10,DIONYZA,"The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here"
77319,77320,Pericles,3.0,4.1.11,DIONYZA,she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
77320,77321,Pericles,3.0,4.1.12,DIONYZA,Thou art resolved?
77321,77322,Pericles,4.0,4.1.13,LEONINE,I am resolved.
77322,77323,Pericles,4.0,,LEONINE,"Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers"
77323,77324,Pericles,5.0,4.1.14,MARINA,"No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,"
77324,77325,Pericles,5.0,4.1.15,MARINA,"To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,"
77325,77326,Pericles,5.0,4.1.16,MARINA,"The purple violets, and marigolds,"
77326,77327,Pericles,5.0,4.1.17,MARINA,"Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,"
77327,77328,Pericles,5.0,4.1.18,MARINA,"While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,"
77328,77329,Pericles,5.0,4.1.19,MARINA,"Born in a tempest, when my mother died,"
77329,77330,Pericles,5.0,4.1.20,MARINA,"This world to me is like a lasting storm,"
77330,77331,Pericles,5.0,4.1.21,MARINA,Whirring me from my friends.
77331,77332,Pericles,6.0,4.1.22,DIONYZA,"How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?"
77332,77333,Pericles,6.0,4.1.23,DIONYZA,How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
77333,77334,Pericles,6.0,4.1.24,DIONYZA,Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
77334,77335,Pericles,6.0,4.1.25,DIONYZA,"A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed"
77335,77336,Pericles,6.0,4.1.26,DIONYZA,With this unprofitable woe!
77336,77337,Pericles,6.0,4.1.27,DIONYZA,"Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it."
77337,77338,Pericles,6.0,4.1.28,DIONYZA,"Walk with Leonine, the air is quick there,"
77338,77339,Pericles,6.0,4.1.29,DIONYZA,"And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,"
77339,77340,Pericles,6.0,4.1.30,DIONYZA,"Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her."
77340,77341,Pericles,7.0,4.1.31,MARINA,"No, I pray you,"
77341,77342,Pericles,7.0,4.1.32,MARINA,I'll not bereave you of your servant.
77342,77343,Pericles,8.0,4.1.33,DIONYZA,"Come, come,"
77343,77344,Pericles,8.0,4.1.34,DIONYZA,"I love the king your father, and yourself,"
77344,77345,Pericles,8.0,4.1.35,DIONYZA,With more than foreign heart. We every day
77345,77346,Pericles,8.0,4.1.36,DIONYZA,Expect him here: when he shall come and find
77346,77347,Pericles,8.0,4.1.37,DIONYZA,"Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,"
77347,77348,Pericles,8.0,4.1.38,DIONYZA,"He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,"
77348,77349,Pericles,8.0,4.1.39,DIONYZA,"Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken"
77349,77350,Pericles,8.0,4.1.40,DIONYZA,"No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,"
77350,77351,Pericles,8.0,4.1.41,DIONYZA,"Walk, and be cheerful once again, reserve"
77351,77352,Pericles,8.0,4.1.42,DIONYZA,"That excellent complexion, which did steal"
77352,77353,Pericles,8.0,4.1.43,DIONYZA,The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
77353,77354,Pericles,8.0,4.1.44,DIONYZA,I can go home alone.
77354,77355,Pericles,9.0,4.1.45,MARINA,"Well, I will go,"
77355,77356,Pericles,9.0,4.1.46,MARINA,But yet I have no desire to it.
77356,77357,Pericles,10.0,4.1.47,DIONYZA,"Come, come, I know 'tis good for you."
77357,77358,Pericles,10.0,4.1.48,DIONYZA,"Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:"
77358,77359,Pericles,10.0,4.1.49,DIONYZA,Remember what I have said.
77359,77360,Pericles,11.0,4.1.50,LEONINE,"I warrant you, madam."
77360,77361,Pericles,12.0,4.1.51,DIONYZA,"I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:"
77361,77362,Pericles,12.0,4.1.52,DIONYZA,"Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:"
77362,77363,Pericles,12.0,4.1.53,DIONYZA,What! I must have a care of you.
77363,77364,Pericles,13.0,4.1.54,MARINA,"My thanks, sweet madam."
77364,77365,Pericles,13.0,,MARINA,Exit DIONYZA
77365,77366,Pericles,13.0,4.1.55,MARINA,Is this wind westerly that blows?
77366,77367,Pericles,14.0,4.1.56,LEONINE,South-west.
77367,77368,Pericles,15.0,4.1.57,MARINA,"When I was born, the wind was north."
77368,77369,Pericles,16.0,4.1.58,LEONINE,Was't so?
77369,77370,Pericles,17.0,4.1.59,MARINA,"My father, as nurse said, did never fear,"
77370,77371,Pericles,17.0,4.1.60,MARINA,"But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling"
77371,77372,Pericles,17.0,4.1.61,MARINA,"His kingly hands, haling ropes,"
77372,77373,Pericles,17.0,4.1.62,MARINA,"And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea"
77373,77374,Pericles,17.0,4.1.63,MARINA,That almost burst the deck.
77374,77375,Pericles,18.0,4.1.64,LEONINE,When was this?
77375,77376,Pericles,19.0,4.1.65,MARINA,When I was born:
77376,77377,Pericles,19.0,4.1.66,MARINA,"Never was waves nor wind more violent,"
77377,77378,Pericles,19.0,4.1.67,MARINA,And from the ladder-tackle washes off
77378,77379,Pericles,19.0,4.1.68,MARINA,"A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'"
77379,77380,Pericles,19.0,4.1.69,MARINA,And with a dropping industry they skip
77380,77381,Pericles,19.0,4.1.70,MARINA,"From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and"
77381,77382,Pericles,19.0,4.1.71,MARINA,"The master calls, and trebles their confusion."
77382,77383,Pericles,20.0,4.1.72,LEONINE,"Come, say your prayers."
77383,77384,Pericles,21.0,4.1.73,MARINA,What mean you?
77384,77385,Pericles,22.0,4.1.74,LEONINE,"If you require a little space for prayer,"
77385,77386,Pericles,22.0,4.1.75,LEONINE,"I grant it: pray, but be not tedious,"
77386,77387,Pericles,22.0,4.1.76,LEONINE,"For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn"
77387,77388,Pericles,22.0,4.1.77,LEONINE,To do my work with haste.
77388,77389,Pericles,23.0,4.1.78,MARINA,Why will you kill me?
77389,77390,Pericles,24.0,4.1.79,LEONINE,To satisfy my lady.
77390,77391,Pericles,25.0,4.1.80,MARINA,Why would she have me kill'd?
77391,77392,Pericles,25.0,4.1.81,MARINA,"Now, as I can remember, by my troth,"
77392,77393,Pericles,25.0,4.1.82,MARINA,I never did her hurt in all my life:
77393,77394,Pericles,25.0,4.1.83,MARINA,"I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn"
77394,77395,Pericles,25.0,4.1.84,MARINA,"To any living creature: believe me, la,"
77395,77396,Pericles,25.0,4.1.85,MARINA,"I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:"
77396,77397,Pericles,25.0,4.1.86,MARINA,"I trod upon a worm against my will,"
77397,77398,Pericles,25.0,4.1.87,MARINA,"But I wept for it. How have I offended,"
77398,77399,Pericles,25.0,4.1.88,MARINA,"Wherein my death might yield her any profit,"
77399,77400,Pericles,25.0,4.1.89,MARINA,Or my life imply her any danger?
77400,77401,Pericles,26.0,4.1.90,LEONINE,My commission
77401,77402,Pericles,26.0,4.1.91,LEONINE,"Is not to reason of the deed, but do it."
77402,77403,Pericles,27.0,4.1.92,MARINA,"You will not do't for all the world, I hope."
77403,77404,Pericles,27.0,4.1.93,MARINA,"You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow"
77404,77405,Pericles,27.0,4.1.94,MARINA,"You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,"
77405,77406,Pericles,27.0,4.1.95,MARINA,When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
77406,77407,Pericles,27.0,4.1.96,MARINA,"Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:"
77407,77408,Pericles,27.0,4.1.97,MARINA,"Your lady seeks my life, come you between,"
77408,77409,Pericles,27.0,4.1.98,MARINA,"And save poor me, the weaker."
77409,77410,Pericles,28.0,4.1.99,LEONINE,"I am sworn,"
77410,77411,Pericles,28.0,4.1.100,LEONINE,And will dispatch.
77411,77412,Pericles,28.0,,LEONINE,He seizes her
77412,77413,Pericles,28.0,,LEONINE,Enter Pirates
77413,77414,Pericles,29.0,4.1.101,First Pirate,"Hold, villain!"
77414,77415,Pericles,29.0,,First Pirate,LEONINE runs away
77415,77416,Pericles,30.0,4.1.102,Second Pirate,A prize! a prize!
77416,77417,Pericles,31.0,4.1.103,Third Pirate,"Half-part, mates, half-part."
77417,77418,Pericles,31.0,4.1.104,Third Pirate,"Come, let's have her aboard suddenly."
77418,77419,Pericles,31.0,,Third Pirate,Exeunt Pirates with MARINA
77419,77420,Pericles,31.0,,Third Pirate,Re-enter LEONINE
77420,77421,Pericles,32.0,4.1.105,LEONINE,"These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes,"
77421,77422,Pericles,32.0,4.1.106,LEONINE,And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
77422,77423,Pericles,32.0,4.1.107,LEONINE,There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
77423,77424,Pericles,32.0,4.1.108,LEONINE,"she's dead,"
77424,77425,Pericles,32.0,4.1.109,LEONINE,And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
77425,77426,Pericles,32.0,4.1.110,LEONINE,"Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,"
77426,77427,Pericles,32.0,4.1.111,LEONINE,"Not carry her aboard. If she remain,"
77427,77428,Pericles,32.0,4.1.112,LEONINE,Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.
77428,77429,Pericles,32.0,,LEONINE,Exit
77429,77430,Pericles,32.0,,LEONINE,SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.
77430,77431,Pericles,32.0,,LEONINE,"Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT"
77431,77432,Pericles,1.0,4.2.1,Pandar,Boult!
77432,77433,Pericles,2.0,4.2.2,BOULT,Sir?
77433,77434,Pericles,3.0,4.2.3,Pandar,"Search the market narrowly, Mytilene is full of"
77434,77435,Pericles,3.0,4.2.4,Pandar,gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
77435,77436,Pericles,3.0,4.2.5,Pandar,too wenchless.
77436,77437,Pericles,4.0,4.2.6,Bawd,We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
77437,77438,Pericles,4.0,4.2.7,Bawd,"poor three, and they can do no more than they can"
77438,77439,Pericles,4.0,4.2.8,Bawd,"do, and they with continual action are even as good as rotten."
77439,77440,Pericles,5.0,4.2.9,Pandar,"Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for"
77440,77441,Pericles,5.0,4.2.10,Pandar,them. If there be not a conscience to be used in
77441,77442,Pericles,5.0,4.2.11,Pandar,"every trade, we shall never prosper."
77442,77443,Pericles,6.0,4.2.12,Bawd,Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
77443,77444,Pericles,6.0,4.2.13,Bawd,"bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--"
77444,77445,Pericles,7.0,4.2.14,BOULT,"Ay, to eleven, and brought them down again. But"
77445,77446,Pericles,7.0,4.2.15,BOULT,shall I search the market?
77446,77447,Pericles,8.0,4.2.16,Bawd,"What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind"
77447,77448,Pericles,8.0,4.2.17,Bawd,"will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden."
77448,77449,Pericles,9.0,4.2.18,Pandar,"Thou sayest true, they're too unwholesome, o'"
77449,77450,Pericles,9.0,4.2.19,Pandar,"conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that"

77451,77452,Pericles,10.0,4.2.21,BOULT,"Ay, she quickly pooped him, she made him roast-meat"
77452,77453,Pericles,10.0,4.2.22,BOULT,for worms. But I'll go search the market.

77454,77455,Pericles,11.0,4.2.23,Pandar,Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
77455,77456,Pericles,11.0,4.2.24,Pandar,"proportion to live quietly, and so give over."
77456,77457,Pericles,12.0,4.2.25,Bawd,"Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get"
77457,77458,Pericles,12.0,4.2.26,Bawd,when we are old?
77458,77459,Pericles,13.0,4.2.27,Pandar,"O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor"
77459,77460,Pericles,13.0,4.2.28,Pandar,"the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,"
77460,77461,Pericles,13.0,4.2.29,Pandar,if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
77461,77462,Pericles,13.0,4.2.30,Pandar,"estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched."
77462,77463,Pericles,13.0,4.2.31,Pandar,"Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods"
77463,77464,Pericles,13.0,4.2.32,Pandar,will be strong with us for giving over.
77464,77465,Pericles,14.0,4.2.33,Bawd,"Come, other sorts offend as well as we."
77465,77466,Pericles,15.0,4.2.34,Pandar,"As well as we! ay, and better too, we offend worse."
77466,77467,Pericles,15.0,4.2.35,Pandar,"Neither is our profession any trade, it's no"
77467,77468,Pericles,15.0,4.2.36,Pandar,calling. But here comes Boult.
77468,77469,Pericles,15.0,,Pandar,"Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA"
77469,77470,Pericles,16.0,4.2.37,BOULT,"[To MARINA]  Come your ways. My masters, you say"
77470,77471,Pericles,16.0,4.2.38,BOULT,she's a virgin?
77471,77472,Pericles,17.0,4.2.39,First Pirate,"O, sir, we doubt it not."
77472,77473,Pericles,18.0,4.2.40,BOULT,"Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:"
77473,77474,Pericles,18.0,4.2.41,BOULT,"if you like her, so, if not, I have lost my earnest."
77474,77475,Pericles,19.0,4.2.42,Bawd,"Boult, has she any qualities?"
77475,77476,Pericles,20.0,4.2.43,BOULT,"She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent"
77476,77477,Pericles,20.0,4.2.44,BOULT,good clothes: there's no further necessity of
77477,77478,Pericles,20.0,4.2.45,BOULT,qualities can make her be refused.
77478,77479,Pericles,21.0,4.2.46,Bawd,"What's her price, Boult?"
77479,77480,Pericles,22.0,4.2.47,BOULT,I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
77480,77481,Pericles,23.0,4.2.48,Pandar,"Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your"
77481,77482,Pericles,23.0,4.2.49,Pandar,"money presently. Wife, take her in, instruct her"
77482,77483,Pericles,23.0,4.2.50,Pandar,"what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her"
77483,77484,Pericles,23.0,4.2.51,Pandar,entertainment.
77484,77485,Pericles,23.0,,Pandar,Exeunt Pandar and Pirates

77486,77487,Pericles,24.0,4.2.53,Bawd,"hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her"
77487,77488,Pericles,24.0,4.2.54,Bawd,"virginity, and cry 'He that will give most shall"
77488,77489,Pericles,24.0,4.2.55,Bawd,have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
77489,77490,Pericles,24.0,4.2.56,Bawd,"thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done"
77490,77491,Pericles,24.0,4.2.57,Bawd,as I command you.
77491,77492,Pericles,25.0,4.2.58,BOULT,Performance shall follow.
77492,77493,Pericles,25.0,,BOULT,Exit
77493,77494,Pericles,26.0,4.2.59,MARINA,"Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!"
77494,77495,Pericles,26.0,4.2.60,MARINA,"He should have struck, not spoke, or that these pirates,"
77495,77496,Pericles,26.0,4.2.61,MARINA,"Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me"
77496,77497,Pericles,26.0,4.2.62,MARINA,For to seek my mother!
77497,77498,Pericles,27.0,4.2.63,Bawd,"Why lament you, pretty one?"
77498,77499,Pericles,28.0,4.2.64,MARINA,That I am pretty.
77499,77500,Pericles,29.0,4.2.65,Bawd,"Come, the gods have done their part in you."
77500,77501,Pericles,30.0,4.2.66,MARINA,I accuse them not.
77501,77502,Pericles,31.0,4.2.67,Bawd,"You are light into my hands, where you are like to live."
77502,77503,Pericles,32.0,4.2.68,MARINA,The more my fault
77503,77504,Pericles,32.0,4.2.69,MARINA,To scape his hands where I was like to die.
77504,77505,Pericles,33.0,4.2.70,Bawd,"Ay, and you shall live in pleasure."
77505,77506,Pericles,34.0,4.2.71,MARINA,No.
77506,77507,Pericles,35.0,4.2.72,Bawd,"Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all"

77508,77509,Pericles,35.0,4.2.74,Bawd,difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?
77509,77510,Pericles,36.0,4.2.75,MARINA,Are you a woman?
77510,77511,Pericles,37.0,4.2.76,Bawd,"What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?"
77511,77512,Pericles,38.0,4.2.77,MARINA,"An honest woman, or not a woman."
77512,77513,Pericles,39.0,4.2.78,Bawd,"Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have"
77513,77514,Pericles,39.0,4.2.79,Bawd,"something to do with you. Come, you're a young"
77514,77515,Pericles,39.0,4.2.80,Bawd,"foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have"
77515,77516,Pericles,39.0,4.2.81,Bawd,you.
77516,77517,Pericles,40.0,4.2.82,MARINA,The gods defend me!
77517,77518,Pericles,41.0,4.2.83,Bawd,"If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men"
77518,77519,Pericles,41.0,4.2.84,Bawd,"must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir"
77519,77520,Pericles,41.0,4.2.85,Bawd,you up. Boult's returned.
77520,77521,Pericles,41.0,,Bawd,Re-enter BOULT
77521,77522,Pericles,41.0,4.2.86,Bawd,"Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?"
77522,77523,Pericles,42.0,4.2.87,BOULT,"I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs,"
77523,77524,Pericles,42.0,4.2.88,BOULT,I have drawn her picture with my voice.
77524,77525,Pericles,43.0,4.2.89,Bawd,"And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the"
77525,77526,Pericles,43.0,4.2.90,Bawd,"inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?"
77526,77527,Pericles,44.0,4.2.91,BOULT,"'Faith, they listened to me as they would have"
77527,77528,Pericles,44.0,4.2.92,BOULT,hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
77528,77529,Pericles,44.0,4.2.93,BOULT,"Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to"
77529,77530,Pericles,44.0,4.2.94,BOULT,her very description.
77530,77531,Pericles,45.0,4.2.95,Bawd,We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.
77531,77532,Pericles,46.0,4.2.96,BOULT,"To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the"
77532,77533,Pericles,46.0,4.2.97,BOULT,French knight that cowers i' the hams?
77533,77534,Pericles,47.0,4.2.98,Bawd,"Who, Monsieur Veroles?"
77534,77535,Pericles,48.0,4.2.99,BOULT,"Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the"
77535,77536,Pericles,48.0,4.2.100,BOULT,"proclamation, but he made a groan at it, and swore"
77536,77537,Pericles,48.0,4.2.101,BOULT,he would see her to-morrow.
77537,77538,Pericles,49.0,4.2.102,Bawd,"Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease"
77538,77539,Pericles,49.0,4.2.103,Bawd,hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will
77539,77540,Pericles,49.0,4.2.104,Bawd,"come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the"
77540,77541,Pericles,49.0,4.2.105,Bawd,sun.
77541,77542,Pericles,50.0,4.2.106,BOULT,"Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we"
77542,77543,Pericles,50.0,4.2.107,BOULT,should lodge them with this sign.
77543,77544,Pericles,51.0,4.2.108,Bawd,"[To MARINA]  Pray you, come hither awhile. You"
77544,77545,Pericles,51.0,4.2.109,Bawd,have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must
77545,77546,Pericles,51.0,4.2.110,Bawd,seem to do that fearfully which you commit
77546,77547,Pericles,51.0,4.2.111,Bawd,"willingly, despise profit where you have most gain."
77547,77548,Pericles,51.0,4.2.112,Bawd,To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
77548,77549,Pericles,51.0,4.2.113,Bawd,lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good
77549,77550,Pericles,51.0,4.2.114,Bawd,"opinion, and that opinion a mere profit."
77550,77551,Pericles,52.0,4.2.115,MARINA,I understand you not.
77551,77552,Pericles,53.0,4.2.116,BOULT,"O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these"
77552,77553,Pericles,53.0,4.2.117,BOULT,blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.
77553,77554,Pericles,54.0,4.2.118,Bawd,"Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must, for your"
77554,77555,Pericles,54.0,4.2.119,Bawd,bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
77555,77556,Pericles,54.0,4.2.120,Bawd,with warrant.
77556,77557,Pericles,55.0,4.2.121,BOULT,"'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if"
77557,77558,Pericles,55.0,4.2.122,BOULT,"I have bargained for the joint,--"
77558,77559,Pericles,56.0,4.2.123,Bawd,Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
77559,77560,Pericles,57.0,4.2.124,BOULT,I may so.
77560,77561,Pericles,58.0,4.2.125,Bawd,"Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the"
77561,77562,Pericles,58.0,4.2.126,Bawd,manner of your garments well.
77562,77563,Pericles,59.0,4.2.127,BOULT,"Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet."
77563,77564,Pericles,60.0,4.2.128,Bawd,"Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a"
77564,77565,Pericles,60.0,4.2.129,Bawd,"sojourner we have, you'll lose nothing by custom."
77565,77566,Pericles,60.0,4.2.130,Bawd,"When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good"
77566,77567,Pericles,60.0,4.2.131,Bawd,"turn, therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou"
77567,77568,Pericles,60.0,4.2.132,Bawd,hast the harvest out of thine own report.
77568,77569,Pericles,61.0,4.2.133,BOULT,"I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake"
77569,77570,Pericles,61.0,4.2.134,BOULT,the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
77570,77571,Pericles,61.0,4.2.135,BOULT,the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
77571,77572,Pericles,62.0,4.2.136,Bawd,"Come your ways, follow me."
77572,77573,Pericles,63.0,4.2.137,MARINA,"If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,"
77573,77574,Pericles,63.0,4.2.138,MARINA,Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
77574,77575,Pericles,63.0,4.2.139,MARINA,"Diana, aid my purpose!"
77575,77576,Pericles,64.0,4.2.140,Bawd,"What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?"

77578,77579,Pericles,64.0,,Bawd,Enter CLEON and DIONYZA
77579,77580,Pericles,1.0,4.3.1,DIONYZA,"Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?"
77580,77581,Pericles,2.0,4.3.2,CLEON,"O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter"
77581,77582,Pericles,2.0,4.3.3,CLEON,The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!
77582,77583,Pericles,3.0,4.3.4,DIONYZA,I think
77583,77584,Pericles,3.0,4.3.5,DIONYZA,You'll turn a child again.
77584,77585,Pericles,4.0,4.3.6,CLEON,"Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,"
77585,77586,Pericles,4.0,4.3.7,CLEON,"I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,"
77586,77587,Pericles,4.0,4.3.8,CLEON,"Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess"
77587,77588,Pericles,4.0,4.3.9,CLEON,To equal any single crown o' the earth
77588,77589,Pericles,4.0,4.3.10,CLEON,I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
77589,77590,Pericles,4.0,4.3.11,CLEON,Whom thou hast poison'd too:
77590,77591,Pericles,4.0,4.3.12,CLEON,"If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness"
77591,77592,Pericles,4.0,4.3.13,CLEON,Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
77592,77593,Pericles,4.0,4.3.14,CLEON,When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
77593,77594,Pericles,5.0,4.3.15,DIONYZA,"That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,"
77594,77595,Pericles,5.0,4.3.16,DIONYZA,"To foster it, nor ever to preserve."
77595,77596,Pericles,5.0,4.3.17,DIONYZA,"She died at night, I'll say so. Who can cross it?"
77596,77597,Pericles,5.0,4.3.18,DIONYZA,"Unless you play the pious innocent,"
77597,77598,Pericles,5.0,4.3.19,DIONYZA,And for an honest attribute cry out
77598,77599,Pericles,5.0,4.3.20,DIONYZA,'She died by foul play.'
77599,77600,Pericles,6.0,4.3.21,CLEON,"O, go to. Well, well,"
77600,77601,Pericles,6.0,4.3.22,CLEON,"Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods"
77601,77602,Pericles,6.0,4.3.23,CLEON,Do like this worst.
77602,77603,Pericles,7.0,4.3.24,DIONYZA,Be one of those that think

77604,77605,Pericles,7.0,4.3.26,DIONYZA,And open this to Pericles. I do shame
77605,77606,Pericles,7.0,4.3.27,DIONYZA,"To think of what a noble strain you are,"
77606,77607,Pericles,7.0,4.3.28,DIONYZA,And of how coward a spirit.
77607,77608,Pericles,8.0,4.3.29,CLEON,To such proceeding
77608,77609,Pericles,8.0,4.3.30,CLEON,"Who ever but his approbation added,"
77609,77610,Pericles,8.0,4.3.31,CLEON,"Though not his prime consent, he did not flow"
77610,77611,Pericles,8.0,4.3.32,CLEON,From honourable sources.

77612,77613,Pericles,9.0,4.3.34,DIONYZA,"Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,"
77613,77614,Pericles,9.0,4.3.35,DIONYZA,"Nor none can know, Leonine being gone."
77614,77615,Pericles,9.0,4.3.36,DIONYZA,"She did disdain my child, and stood between"
77615,77616,Pericles,9.0,4.3.37,DIONYZA,"Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,"
77616,77617,Pericles,9.0,4.3.38,DIONYZA,"But cast their gazes on Marina's face,"
77617,77618,Pericles,9.0,4.3.39,DIONYZA,Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
77618,77619,Pericles,9.0,4.3.40,DIONYZA,"Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through,"
77619,77620,Pericles,9.0,4.3.41,DIONYZA,"And though you call my course unnatural,"
77620,77621,Pericles,9.0,4.3.42,DIONYZA,"You not your child well loving, yet I find"
77621,77622,Pericles,9.0,4.3.43,DIONYZA,It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
77622,77623,Pericles,9.0,4.3.44,DIONYZA,Perform'd to your sole daughter.
77623,77624,Pericles,10.0,4.3.45,CLEON,Heavens forgive it!
77624,77625,Pericles,11.0,4.3.46,DIONYZA,"And as for Pericles,"
77625,77626,Pericles,11.0,4.3.47,DIONYZA,"What should he say? We wept after her hearse,"
77626,77627,Pericles,11.0,4.3.48,DIONYZA,And yet we mourn: her monument
77627,77628,Pericles,11.0,4.3.49,DIONYZA,"Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs"
77628,77629,Pericles,11.0,4.3.50,DIONYZA,In glittering golden characters express
77629,77630,Pericles,11.0,4.3.51,DIONYZA,"A general praise to her, and care in us"
77630,77631,Pericles,11.0,4.3.52,DIONYZA,At whose expense 'tis done.
77631,77632,Pericles,12.0,4.3.53,CLEON,"Thou art like the harpy,"
77632,77633,Pericles,12.0,4.3.54,CLEON,"Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,"
77633,77634,Pericles,12.0,4.3.55,CLEON,Seize with thine eagle's talons.
77634,77635,Pericles,13.0,4.3.56,DIONYZA,You are like one that superstitiously

77713,77714,Pericles,2.0,4.6.4,Bawd,"Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must"
77714,77715,Pericles,2.0,4.6.5,Bawd,"either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she"

77723,77724,Pericles,5.0,4.6.14,Bawd,"'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the"
77724,77725,Pericles,5.0,4.6.15,Bawd,way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.
77725,77726,Pericles,6.0,4.6.16,BOULT,"We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish"

77732,77733,Pericles,10.0,4.6.22,LYSIMACHUS,resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
77733,77734,Pericles,10.0,4.6.23,LYSIMACHUS,wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
77734,77735,Pericles,10.0,4.6.24,LYSIMACHUS,"withal, and defy the surgeon?"
77735,77736,Pericles,11.0,4.6.25,Bawd,"We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never"
77736,77737,Pericles,11.0,4.6.26,Bawd,came her like in Mytilene.
77737,77738,Pericles,12.0,4.6.27,LYSIMACHUS,"If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say."

77742,77743,Pericles,16.0,4.6.32,LYSIMACHUS,"What, prithee?"
77743,77744,Pericles,17.0,4.6.33,BOULT,"O, sir, I can be modest."
77744,77745,Pericles,18.0,4.6.34,LYSIMACHUS,"That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it"
77745,77746,Pericles,18.0,4.6.35,LYSIMACHUS,gives a good report to a number to be chaste.
77746,77747,Pericles,18.0,,LYSIMACHUS,Exit BOULT
77747,77748,Pericles,19.0,4.6.36,Bawd,"Here comes that which grows to the stalk, never"

77752,77753,Pericles,20.0,4.6.40,LYSIMACHUS,"Well, there's for you: leave us."
77753,77754,Pericles,21.0,4.6.41,Bawd,"I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and"
77754,77755,Pericles,21.0,4.6.42,Bawd,I'll have done presently.
77755,77756,Pericles,22.0,4.6.43,LYSIMACHUS,"I beseech you, do."

77758,77759,Pericles,24.0,4.6.46,MARINA,"I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him."
77759,77760,Pericles,25.0,4.6.47,Bawd,"Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man"

77762,77763,Pericles,26.0,4.6.50,MARINA,"indeed, but how honourable he is in that, I know not."
77763,77764,Pericles,27.0,4.6.51,Bawd,"Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will"
77764,77765,Pericles,27.0,4.6.52,Bawd,you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.
77765,77766,Pericles,28.0,4.6.53,MARINA,"What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive."
77766,77767,Pericles,29.0,4.6.54,LYSIMACHUS,Ha' you done?
77767,77768,Pericles,30.0,4.6.55,Bawd,"My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some"
77768,77769,Pericles,30.0,4.6.56,Bawd,"pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will"
77769,77770,Pericles,30.0,4.6.57,Bawd,leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.

77772,77773,Pericles,32.0,4.6.59,MARINA,"What trade, sir?"
77773,77774,Pericles,33.0,4.6.60,LYSIMACHUS,"Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend."
77774,77775,Pericles,34.0,4.6.61,MARINA,I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.
77775,77776,Pericles,35.0,4.6.62,LYSIMACHUS,How long have you been of this profession?
77776,77777,Pericles,36.0,4.6.63,MARINA,E'er since I can remember.
77777,77778,Pericles,37.0,4.6.64,LYSIMACHUS,Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at
77778,77779,Pericles,37.0,4.6.65,LYSIMACHUS,five or at seven?
77779,77780,Pericles,38.0,4.6.66,MARINA,"Earlier too, sir, if now I be one."
77780,77781,Pericles,39.0,4.6.67,LYSIMACHUS,"Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a"

77782,77783,Pericles,40.0,4.6.69,MARINA,"Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,"
77783,77784,Pericles,40.0,4.6.70,MARINA,and will come into 't? I hear say you are of
77784,77785,Pericles,40.0,4.6.71,MARINA,"honourable parts, and are the governor of this place."
77785,77786,Pericles,41.0,4.6.72,LYSIMACHUS,"Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?"
77786,77787,Pericles,42.0,4.6.73,MARINA,Who is my principal?
77787,77788,Pericles,43.0,4.6.74,LYSIMACHUS,"Why, your herb-woman, she that sets seeds and roots"
77788,77789,Pericles,43.0,4.6.75,LYSIMACHUS,"of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something"
77789,77790,Pericles,43.0,4.6.76,LYSIMACHUS,"of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious"
77790,77791,Pericles,43.0,4.6.77,LYSIMACHUS,"wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my"
77791,77792,Pericles,43.0,4.6.78,LYSIMACHUS,"authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly"

77793,77794,Pericles,43.0,4.6.80,LYSIMACHUS,"come, come."
77794,77795,Pericles,44.0,4.6.81,MARINA,"If you were born to honour, show it now,"
77795,77796,Pericles,44.0,4.6.82,MARINA,"If put upon you, make the judgment good"
77796,77797,Pericles,44.0,4.6.83,MARINA,That thought you worthy of it.
77797,77798,Pericles,45.0,4.6.84,LYSIMACHUS,"How's this? how's this? Some more, be sage."
77798,77799,Pericles,46.0,4.6.85,MARINA,"For me,"

77808,77809,Pericles,47.0,4.6.95,LYSIMACHUS,"Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,"
77809,77810,Pericles,47.0,4.6.96,LYSIMACHUS,"Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:"
77810,77811,Pericles,47.0,4.6.97,LYSIMACHUS,"Persever in that clear way thou goest,"
77811,77812,Pericles,47.0,4.6.98,LYSIMACHUS,And the gods strengthen thee!
77812,77813,Pericles,48.0,4.6.99,MARINA,The good gods preserve you!
77813,77814,Pericles,49.0,4.6.100,LYSIMACHUS,"For me, be you thoughten"

78001,78002,Pericles,23.0,5.1.62,HELICANUS,"That for our gold we may provision have,"
78002,78003,Pericles,23.0,5.1.63,HELICANUS,"Wherein we are not destitute for want,"
78003,78004,Pericles,23.0,5.1.64,HELICANUS,But weary for the staleness.
78004,78005,Pericles,24.0,5.1.65,LYSIMACHUS,"O, sir, a courtesy"
78005,78006,Pericles,24.0,5.1.66,LYSIMACHUS,"Which if we should deny, the most just gods"
78006,78007,Pericles,24.0,5.1.67,LYSIMACHUS,"For every graff would send a caterpillar,"
78007,78008,Pericles,24.0,5.1.68,LYSIMACHUS,And so afflict our province. Yet once more
78008,78009,Pericles,24.0,5.1.69,LYSIMACHUS,Let me entreat to know at large the cause
78009,78010,Pericles,24.0,5.1.70,LYSIMACHUS,Of your king's sorrow.
78010,78011,Pericles,25.0,5.1.71,HELICANUS,"Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:"
78011,78012,Pericles,25.0,5.1.72,HELICANUS,"But, see, I am prevented."
78012,78013,Pericles,25.0,,HELICANUS,"Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young Lady"
78013,78014,Pericles,26.0,5.1.73,LYSIMACHUS,"O, here is"
78014,78015,Pericles,26.0,5.1.74,LYSIMACHUS,"The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!"
78015,78016,Pericles,26.0,5.1.75,LYSIMACHUS,Is't not a goodly presence?
78016,78017,Pericles,27.0,5.1.76,HELICANUS,She's a gallant lady.
78017,78018,Pericles,28.0,5.1.77,LYSIMACHUS,"She's such a one, that, were I well assured"
78018,78019,Pericles,28.0,5.1.78,LYSIMACHUS,"Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,"
78019,78020,Pericles,28.0,5.1.79,LYSIMACHUS,"I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed."
78020,78021,Pericles,28.0,5.1.80,LYSIMACHUS,"Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty"
78021,78022,Pericles,28.0,5.1.81,LYSIMACHUS,"Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:"
78022,78023,Pericles,28.0,5.1.82,LYSIMACHUS,If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
78023,78024,Pericles,28.0,5.1.83,LYSIMACHUS,"Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,"
78024,78025,Pericles,28.0,5.1.84,LYSIMACHUS,Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
78025,78026,Pericles,28.0,5.1.85,LYSIMACHUS,As thy desires can wish.
78026,78027,Pericles,29.0,5.1.86,MARINA,"Sir, I will use"
78027,78028,Pericles,29.0,5.1.87,MARINA,"My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided"
78028,78029,Pericles,29.0,5.1.88,MARINA,That none but I and my companion maid
78029,78030,Pericles,29.0,5.1.89,MARINA,Be suffer'd to come near him.
78030,78031,Pericles,30.0,5.1.90,LYSIMACHUS,"Come, let us leave her,"
78031,78032,Pericles,30.0,5.1.91,LYSIMACHUS,And the gods make her prosperous!
78032,78033,Pericles,30.0,,LYSIMACHUS,MARINA sings
78033,78034,Pericles,31.0,5.1.92,LYSIMACHUS,Mark'd he your music?
78034,78035,Pericles,32.0,5.1.93,MARINA,"No, nor look'd on us."
78035,78036,Pericles,33.0,5.1.94,LYSIMACHUS,"See, she will speak to him."
78036,78037,Pericles,34.0,5.1.95,MARINA,"Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear."
78037,78038,Pericles,35.0,5.1.96,PERICLES,"Hum, ha!"
78038,78039,Pericles,36.0,5.1.97,MARINA,"I am a maid,"
78039,78040,Pericles,36.0,5.1.98,MARINA,"My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,"
78040,78041,Pericles,36.0,5.1.99,MARINA,"But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,"
78041,78042,Pericles,36.0,5.1.100,MARINA,"My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief"
78042,78043,Pericles,36.0,5.1.101,MARINA,"Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd."
78043,78044,Pericles,36.0,5.1.102,MARINA,"Though wayward fortune did malign my state,"
78044,78045,Pericles,36.0,5.1.103,MARINA,My derivation was from ancestors
78045,78046,Pericles,36.0,5.1.104,MARINA,Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
78046,78047,Pericles,36.0,5.1.105,MARINA,"But time hath rooted out my parentage,"
78047,78048,Pericles,36.0,5.1.106,MARINA,And to the world and awkward casualties
78048,78049,Pericles,36.0,5.1.107,MARINA,Bound me in servitude.
78049,78050,Pericles,36.0,,MARINA,Aside
78050,78051,Pericles,36.0,5.1.108,MARINA,"I will desist,"
78051,78052,Pericles,36.0,5.1.109,MARINA,"But there is something glows upon my cheek,"
78052,78053,Pericles,36.0,5.1.110,MARINA,"And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'"
78053,78054,Pericles,37.0,5.1.111,PERICLES,My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
78054,78055,Pericles,37.0,5.1.112,PERICLES,To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?
78055,78056,Pericles,38.0,5.1.113,MARINA,"I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,"
78056,78057,Pericles,38.0,5.1.114,MARINA,You would not do me violence.
78057,78058,Pericles,39.0,5.1.115,PERICLES,"I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me."
78058,78059,Pericles,39.0,5.1.116,PERICLES,You are like something that--What country-woman?
78059,78060,Pericles,39.0,5.1.117,PERICLES,Here of these shores?
78060,78061,Pericles,40.0,5.1.118,MARINA,"No, nor of any shores:"
78061,78062,Pericles,40.0,5.1.119,MARINA,"Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am"
78062,78063,Pericles,40.0,5.1.120,MARINA,No other than I appear.
78063,78064,Pericles,41.0,5.1.121,PERICLES,"I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping."
78064,78065,Pericles,41.0,5.1.122,PERICLES,"My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one"
78065,78066,Pericles,41.0,5.1.123,PERICLES,"My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows,"
78066,78067,Pericles,41.0,5.1.124,PERICLES,"Her stature to an inch, as wand-like straight,"
78067,78068,Pericles,41.0,5.1.125,PERICLES,"As silver-voiced, her eyes as jewel-like"
78068,78069,Pericles,41.0,5.1.126,PERICLES,"And cased as richly, in pace another Juno,"
78069,78070,Pericles,41.0,5.1.127,PERICLES,"Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,"
78070,78071,Pericles,41.0,5.1.128,PERICLES,The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
78071,78072,Pericles,42.0,5.1.129,MARINA,Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
78072,78073,Pericles,42.0,5.1.130,MARINA,You may discern the place.
78073,78074,Pericles,43.0,5.1.131,PERICLES,Where were you bred?
78074,78075,Pericles,43.0,5.1.132,PERICLES,"And how achieved you these endowments, which"
78075,78076,Pericles,43.0,5.1.133,PERICLES,You make more rich to owe?
78076,78077,Pericles,44.0,5.1.134,MARINA,"If I should tell my history, it would seem"
78077,78078,Pericles,44.0,5.1.135,MARINA,Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
78078,78079,Pericles,45.0,5.1.136,PERICLES,"Prithee, speak:"
78079,78080,Pericles,45.0,5.1.137,PERICLES,"Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou look'st"
78080,78081,Pericles,45.0,5.1.138,PERICLES,"Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace"
78081,78082,Pericles,45.0,5.1.139,PERICLES,For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
78082,78083,Pericles,45.0,5.1.140,PERICLES,"believe thee,"
78083,78084,Pericles,45.0,5.1.141,PERICLES,And make my senses credit thy relation
78084,78085,Pericles,45.0,5.1.142,PERICLES,"To points that seem impossible, for thou look'st"
78085,78086,Pericles,45.0,5.1.143,PERICLES,Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
78086,78087,Pericles,45.0,5.1.144,PERICLES,"Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--"
78087,78088,Pericles,45.0,5.1.145,PERICLES,Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
78088,78089,Pericles,45.0,5.1.146,PERICLES,From good descending?
78089,78090,Pericles,46.0,5.1.147,MARINA,So indeed I did.
78090,78091,Pericles,47.0,5.1.148,PERICLES,Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
78091,78092,Pericles,47.0,5.1.149,PERICLES,"Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,"
78092,78093,Pericles,47.0,5.1.150,PERICLES,"And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,"
78093,78094,Pericles,47.0,5.1.151,PERICLES,If both were open'd.
78094,78095,Pericles,48.0,5.1.152,MARINA,Some such thing
78095,78096,Pericles,48.0,5.1.153,MARINA,"I said, and said no more but what my thoughts"
78096,78097,Pericles,48.0,5.1.154,MARINA,Did warrant me was likely.
78097,78098,Pericles,49.0,5.1.155,PERICLES,"Tell thy story,"
78098,78099,Pericles,49.0,5.1.156,PERICLES,If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
78099,78100,Pericles,49.0,5.1.157,PERICLES,"Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I"
78100,78101,Pericles,49.0,5.1.158,PERICLES,Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
78101,78102,Pericles,49.0,5.1.159,PERICLES,"Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling"
78102,78103,Pericles,49.0,5.1.160,PERICLES,Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
78103,78104,Pericles,49.0,5.1.161,PERICLES,"How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?"
78104,78105,Pericles,49.0,5.1.162,PERICLES,"Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me."
78105,78106,Pericles,50.0,5.1.163,MARINA,My name is Marina.
78106,78107,Pericles,51.0,5.1.164,PERICLES,"O, I am mock'd,"
78107,78108,Pericles,51.0,5.1.165,PERICLES,And thou by some incensed god sent hither
78108,78109,Pericles,51.0,5.1.166,PERICLES,To make the world to laugh at me.
78109,78110,Pericles,52.0,5.1.167,MARINA,"Patience, good sir,"
78110,78111,Pericles,52.0,5.1.168,MARINA,Or here I'll cease.
78111,78112,Pericles,53.0,5.1.169,PERICLES,"Nay, I'll be patient."
78112,78113,Pericles,53.0,5.1.170,PERICLES,"Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,"
78113,78114,Pericles,53.0,5.1.171,PERICLES,To call thyself Marina.
78114,78115,Pericles,54.0,5.1.172,MARINA,The name
78115,78116,Pericles,54.0,5.1.173,MARINA,"Was given me by one that had some power,"
78116,78117,Pericles,54.0,5.1.174,MARINA,"My father, and a king."
78117,78118,Pericles,55.0,5.1.175,PERICLES,How! a king's daughter?
78118,78119,Pericles,55.0,5.1.176,PERICLES,And call'd Marina?
78119,78120,Pericles,56.0,5.1.177,MARINA,"You said you would believe me,"
78120,78121,Pericles,56.0,5.1.178,MARINA,"But, not to be a troubler of your peace,"
78121,78122,Pericles,56.0,5.1.179,MARINA,I will end here.
78122,78123,Pericles,57.0,5.1.180,PERICLES,But are you flesh and blood?
78123,78124,Pericles,57.0,5.1.181,PERICLES,Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
78124,78125,Pericles,57.0,5.1.182,PERICLES,"Motion! Well, speak on. Where were you born?"
78125,78126,Pericles,57.0,5.1.183,PERICLES,And wherefore call'd Marina?
78126,78127,Pericles,58.0,5.1.184,MARINA,Call'd Marina
78127,78128,Pericles,58.0,5.1.185,MARINA,For I was born at sea.
78128,78129,Pericles,59.0,5.1.186,PERICLES,At sea! what mother?
78129,78130,Pericles,60.0,5.1.187,MARINA,"My mother was the daughter of a king,"
78130,78131,Pericles,60.0,5.1.188,MARINA,"Who died the minute I was born,"
78131,78132,Pericles,60.0,5.1.189,MARINA,As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
78132,78133,Pericles,60.0,5.1.190,MARINA,Deliver'd weeping.
78133,78134,Pericles,61.0,5.1.191,PERICLES,"O, stop there a little!"
78134,78135,Pericles,61.0,,PERICLES,Aside
78135,78136,Pericles,61.0,5.1.192,PERICLES,This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
78136,78137,Pericles,61.0,5.1.193,PERICLES,Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
78137,78138,Pericles,61.0,5.1.194,PERICLES,My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
78138,78139,Pericles,61.0,5.1.195,PERICLES,"I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,"
78139,78140,Pericles,61.0,5.1.196,PERICLES,And never interrupt you.
78140,78141,Pericles,62.0,5.1.197,MARINA,"You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er."
78141,78142,Pericles,63.0,5.1.198,PERICLES,I will believe you by the syllable
78142,78143,Pericles,63.0,5.1.199,PERICLES,"Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:"
78143,78144,Pericles,63.0,5.1.200,PERICLES,How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
78144,78145,Pericles,64.0,5.1.201,MARINA,"The king my father did in Tarsus leave me,"
78145,78146,Pericles,64.0,5.1.202,MARINA,"Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,"
78146,78147,Pericles,64.0,5.1.203,MARINA,Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
78147,78148,Pericles,64.0,5.1.204,MARINA,"A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,"
78148,78149,Pericles,64.0,5.1.205,MARINA,"A crew of pirates came and rescued me,"
78149,78150,Pericles,64.0,5.1.206,MARINA,"Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,"
78150,78151,Pericles,64.0,5.1.207,MARINA,Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
78151,78152,Pericles,64.0,5.1.208,MARINA,"It may be,"
78152,78153,Pericles,64.0,5.1.209,MARINA,"You think me an impostor: no, good faith,"
78153,78154,Pericles,64.0,5.1.210,MARINA,"I am the daughter to King Pericles,"
78154,78155,Pericles,64.0,5.1.211,MARINA,If good King Pericles be.
78155,78156,Pericles,65.0,5.1.212,PERICLES,"Ho, Helicanus!"
78156,78157,Pericles,66.0,5.1.213,HELICANUS,Calls my lord?
78157,78158,Pericles,67.0,5.1.214,PERICLES,"Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,"
78158,78159,Pericles,67.0,5.1.215,PERICLES,"Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,"
78159,78160,Pericles,67.0,5.1.216,PERICLES,"What this maid is, or what is like to be,"
78160,78161,Pericles,67.0,5.1.217,PERICLES,That thus hath made me weep?
78161,78162,Pericles,68.0,5.1.218,HELICANUS,"I know not, but"
78162,78163,Pericles,68.0,5.1.219,HELICANUS,"Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene"
78163,78164,Pericles,68.0,5.1.220,HELICANUS,Speaks nobly of her.
78164,78165,Pericles,69.0,5.1.221,LYSIMACHUS,She would never tell
78165,78166,Pericles,69.0,5.1.222,LYSIMACHUS,"Her parentage, being demanded that,"
78166,78167,Pericles,69.0,5.1.223,LYSIMACHUS,She would sit still and weep.
78167,78168,Pericles,70.0,5.1.224,PERICLES,"O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir,"
78168,78169,Pericles,70.0,5.1.225,PERICLES,"Give me a gash, put me to present pain,"
78169,78170,Pericles,70.0,5.1.226,PERICLES,Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
78170,78171,Pericles,70.0,5.1.227,PERICLES,"O'erbear the shores of my mortality,"
78171,78172,Pericles,70.0,5.1.228,PERICLES,"And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,"
78172,78173,Pericles,70.0,5.1.229,PERICLES,"Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget,"
78173,78174,Pericles,70.0,5.1.230,PERICLES,"Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,"
78174,78175,Pericles,70.0,5.1.231,PERICLES,"And found at sea again! O Helicanus,"
78175,78176,Pericles,70.0,5.1.232,PERICLES,"Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud"
78176,78177,Pericles,70.0,5.1.233,PERICLES,As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
78177,78178,Pericles,70.0,5.1.234,PERICLES,"What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,"
78178,78179,Pericles,70.0,5.1.235,PERICLES,"For truth can never be confirm'd enough,"
78179,78180,Pericles,70.0,5.1.236,PERICLES,Though doubts did ever sleep.
78180,78181,Pericles,71.0,5.1.237,MARINA,"First, sir, I pray,"
78181,78182,Pericles,71.0,5.1.238,MARINA,What is your title?
78182,78183,Pericles,72.0,5.1.239,PERICLES,I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
